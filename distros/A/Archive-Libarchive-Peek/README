NAME

    Archive::Libarchive::Peek - Peek into archives without extracting them

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Archive::Libarchive::Peek;
     my $peek = Archive::Libarchive::Peek->new( filename => 'archive.tar' );
     my @files = $peek->files();
     my $contents = $peek->file('README.txt')

DESCRIPTION

    This module lets you peek into archives without extracting them. It is
    based on Archive::Peek, but it uses Archive::Libarchive, and thus all
    of the many formats supported by libarchive. It also supports some
    unique features of the various classes that use the "Peek" style
    interface:

    Many Many formats

      compressed tar, Zip, RAR, ISO 9660 images, etc.

    Zips with encrypted entries

      You can specify the passphrase or a passphrase callback with the
      constructor

    Multi-file RAR archives

      If filename is an array reference it will be assumed to be a list of
      filenames representing a single multi-file archive.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

     my $peek = Archive::Libarchive::Peek->new(%options);

    This creates a new instance of the Peek object.

    filename

       my $peek = Archive::Libarchive::Peek->new( filename => $filename );

      This option is required, and is the filename of the archive.

    passphrase

       my $peek = Archive::Libarchive::Peek->new( passphrase => $passphrase );
       my $peek = Archive::Libarchive::Peek->new( passphrase => sub {
         ...
         return $passphrase;
       });

      This option is the passphrase for encrypted zip entries, or a
      callback which will return the passphrase.

PROPERTIES

 filename

    This is the archive filename for the Peek object.

METHODS

 files

     my @files = $peek->files;

    This method returns the filenames of the entries in the archive.

 file

     my $content = $peek->file($filename);

    This method files the filename in the archive and returns its content.

 iterate

     $peek->iterate(sub ($filename, $content, $e) {
       ...
     });

    This method iterates over the entries in the archive and calls the
    callback for each entry. The arguments are:

    filename

      The filename of the entry

    content

      The content of the entry, or '' for non-regular or zero-sized files

    entry

      This is a Archive::Libarchive::Entry instance which has metadata
      about the file, like the permissions, timestamps and file type.

 as_hash

     my $hashref = $peek->as_hash;

    Returns a hash reference where the keys are entry pathnames and the
    values are the entry content. This method will attempt to resolve
    symbolic links as scalar references. Hardlinks will be reference
    aliased. Directory and other special types will be handled as array
    reference, the exact format to be determined in the future, although
    the first element in the array reference will be the file type.

SEE ALSO

    Archive::Peek

      The original!

    Archive::Peek::External

      Another implementation that uses external commands to peek into
      archives

    Archive::Peek::Libarchive

      Another implementation that also relies on libarchive, but doesn't
      support the file type in iterate mode, encrypted zip entries, or
      multi-file RAR archives.

    Archive::Libarchive

      A lower-level interface to libarchive which can be used to
      read/extract and create archives of various formats.
