Revision history for Perl extension Benchmark::Featureset::LocaleCountry.

1.03  Thu May 17 13:26:00 2012
	- Replace Locale::Country::SubCountry with WWW::Scraper::Wikipedia::ISO3166::Database V 1.01.
		This is because I have removed Locale::Country::SubCountry from CPAN due to the difficulty of
		keeping it up-to-date with native-language country/subcountry changes.
	- Update pre-reqs.

1.02  Wed Mar 14 12:00:00 2012
	- Fix bad typo in Benchmark::Featureset::LocaleCountry::Config left from careless copy-and-paste from another module.
	- Fix wrong name dir being used for that module (it was *::Util::*).
	- Clean up pod.
	- Re-generate the demo page with newer versions of some modules. See (as of 2012-03-14):
	-   http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/locale.report.html

1.01  Tue Apr 19 17:20:00 2011
	- Make Build.PL and Makefile.PL run scripts/copy.config.pl.
	- Expand docs to discuss config/.htbenchmark.featureset.localecountry.conf, and scripts/copy.config.pl.
	  This section was missing from the docs in V 1.00.

1.00  Mon Apr 18 15:38:35 2011
