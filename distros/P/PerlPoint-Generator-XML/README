
Note: this release is published as a beta, as it contains no tests
      so far. Nevertheless, it is considered stable as it was used
      in several larger projects.


INTRO

Welcome!

This is the PerlPoint::Generator::XML package, which allows you to produce XML
documents from PerlPoint sources. It is a "plugin" package for PerlPoint::Package
which needs to be installed first.

After successful installation, you can call C<pp2tdo> with the C<XML> target,
like so:

  pp2tdo -target XML ... yoursource.pp

This distribution comes with the mandatory default formatter, so this call is
equivalent to

  pp2tdo -target XML -format Default ... yoursource.pp

More formatters are available in other distributions. Please search CPAN or
the project page for C<PerlPoint::Generator::XML::...> modules.

As usual with C<pp2tdo>, the generator brings new options.
Please add C<-help> to a valid call of C<pp2tdo> to get a list of all the
options available.


INSTALLATION

Install this package the usual manual way by

unpacking
make test install distclean

Or use C<cpanp> or C<cpan> to install including all prerequisites.


DOCUMENTATION

Each module comes with its own POD documentation. For an introduction on how to use
PerlPoint, please see the manual provided with the C<PerlPoint::Package> distribution.


SUPPPORT

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.

If you prefer, you can contact me via perl@jochen-stenzel.de
as well.


CREDITS

Benjamin Holzmann, the author of C<XML::Generator>, helped me when I had
questions about his module. It's a handy module to produce XML in the
tradition of C<CGI.pm>, by the way.
