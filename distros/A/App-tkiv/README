               'https://github.com/Tux/App-tkiv/archive/master.tar.gz'

Prerequisites:
    A perl with defined-or (perl 5.8.4 + defined-or, 5.10.x or higher), Tk,
    the plethora of Tk::* image format modules, some Image::* modules (see
    Makefile.PL and/or META.yml) and ImagaMagick (not the perl module) for
    iv uses the "convert" tool.

    On Windows I'd suggest to use IrfanView from http://www.irfanview.com
    plus its Plugins/AddOns instead of iv.

    TIFF images will only display if you additionally install Tk::TIFF.

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install
