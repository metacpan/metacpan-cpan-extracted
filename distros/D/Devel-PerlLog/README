NAME
    Devel::PerlLog - Log Information When `perl` Runs

SYNOPSIS
        export PERL5OPT='-MDevel::PerlLog=/tmp/perl.log'

DESCRIPTION
    Perl gets run a lot. Many times by things that you didn't even know were
    Perl. Even simple things that you know are Perl end up spawning lots of
    other Perl processes. This can make some things hard to figure out.

    For instance, when you run "make" (after running "perl Makefile.PL"),
    over 10 Perl processes are started.

    This module gives you a way of logging every time a new Perl process
    starts, and giving you specific information about that Perl process. You
    just need to load this module using the "PERL5OPT" environment variable.

CONFIGURATION
    All the configuration options for this module are made as arguments to
    "- MDevel::PerlLog". For example:

          export PERL5OPT="-MDevel::PerlLog=$PWD/perl.log,all"

    This section documents the configuration options.

  Log Path
    By default, loggin will be done to STDOUT. If you pass an argument
    string containing a "/" or a "." then that will be used as the file
    path. You should take care to use an absolute file path, or else a new
    log will be started relative to where the Perl starts.

  Plugins
    The following arguments are responsible for reporting certain
    information about the Perl process:

    "argv"
        This will dump the @ARGV at the start of the process.

    "cwd"
        This will show the cwd at the start of the process.

    "pid"
        This will report the Perl process id (PID).

  Groups
    Since there are so many plugins, you can specify groups:

    "all"
        "argv", "cwd", "pid"
