NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::CookiedSession - Store sessions in a browser cookie

SYNOPSIS
      # in your Catalyst application:
      use Catalyst qw(CookiedSession);
      
  __PACKAGE__->config(
          cookiedsession => { key => 'secretkey', expires => '+1d' },
      );
      
  # later on in your code
      $c->session->{product} = 'foo';
      ...
      my $product = $c->session->{product};

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a replacement module for Catalyst::Plugin::Session::*
    which stores the Catalyst session in a browser cookie. This has two
    advantages: it's easier to configure than Catalyst::Plugin::Session::*
    and sessions require no disk IO.

    The session is encrypted using Rijndael using the key you provide in the
    configuration, which should be unique to your application.

    More about Rijndael: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael

    If you do not set an expires value in the configuration, then a session
    cookie is used. You should set a value to make the cookie persist
    through closing the browser: use '+1h' for one hour, '+2d' for two days,
    '+3M' for three months and '+4y' for four years.

    The cookied is named after your application, with _cookiedsession
    appended to the end. Pass in a name value in the configuration to
    override this.

    Note that the cookie is limited in size to 4096 bytes. Keep your
    sessions very small. Alternatively please provide a patch which works
    along the lines of CGI::Cookie::Splitter.
