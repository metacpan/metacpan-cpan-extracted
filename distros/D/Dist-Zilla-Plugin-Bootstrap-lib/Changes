 [00 Major]
 - This release contains mostly packaging changes that will be invisible to CPAN users.
 - However, it may require attention for downstream non-CPAN tooling.

 [01 Version Scheme]
 - Version Scheme is shortened from a mantissa of 8 to a mantissa of 6
 - This is the primary reason for the 1.xxx release.

 [02 Tooling is MakeMaker based]
 - Tooling is now switched to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 - instead of coercing users into installing the latest EUMM/TestMore/MB when not even necessary, that is now only the
   recommended course of action.

 - 5.008: 204 → 207
 - 5.010: 184 → 186
 - 5.019: 168 → 167

 [Bugs]
 - 2 fallback conditions were accidentally using the same logic, so only one would ever work.
 - satisfactory build dirs accidentally lacked a 'lib' suffix, so resulted in a "fallthrough" to system.

0.02000000 2013-04-06T09:38:52Z
 [!Noteworthy Changes]
 - @INC mutation now done slightly later at C<register_component>, which lets us get payload parameters out, while
   still executing the real work long before anything else. Though execution order still matters profusely.
 - 3 new parameters,
 - `try_built` tries to use a previous build instead of a "undef version" based bootstrap
 - `fallback = 1` enables `try_built` to fall back to the `bootstrap lib` form ( this is the default )
 - `no_fallback = 1` disables `fallback`
