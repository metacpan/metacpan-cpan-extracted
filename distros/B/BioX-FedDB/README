DBIx-FedDB version 0.0.1

Enables the counting and retrieval of BLAST results by query and subject using a federated 
database. Uses LWP::Simple to get the results through pre-installed Catalyst web service. A Catalyst 
Controller module is included in the distribution.

The current project includes 100 billion HSPs from 11 million protein sequences and will be 
run across 8-10 machines from a network adjacent server.

I intend to generalize the functionality to suit the module name, although a plug-in system 
seems likely, so a plugin would (will) need to be (and might be) developed per app (ish).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


DEPENDENCIES

None.
