XML::FeedLite
=========

XML::FeedLite is an HTTP client for fetching and processing RSS and
Atom feeds in parallel, using WWW::Curl::Simple.

XML::FeedLite is designed to be fast and light on pre-requisites (no
XML libraries like SAX, Expat, Xerces are required). It should also
work happily under mod_perl including Apache::Registry. Problems using
existing similar modules like XML::Atom in mod_perl were the primary
drivers for writing this module.
