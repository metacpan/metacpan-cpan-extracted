=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

All options can be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous. Option matching is case
sensitive. Forcibly end option parsing using '--'.

=head2

This documents some 'hidden' flags, generally because they're somewhat particular and/or
not ready for prime time...

=over

=item B<--_help>

Displays usage and help with options/arguments. If given, nothing else will be done.

=item B<--_pp> or B<--_pp_file E<lt>fileE<gt>>

Will attempt to generate a binary using the 'pp' command from PAR::Packer.

The first form will generate a default name for the binary (use C<--_info_ppname> to see this),
and the second form makes it possible to use an arbitrary name and path.

An existing file will not be overwritten.

By using the C<--verbose> flag, pp verbosity can be raised.

Information for the command line is generated by internally using the C<--_info_cmd> command. If
needed, that can be used instead for editing. Note that it references TESTONTAP_OUTPUT_FILE,
TESTONTAP_CMD_FILE, TESTONTAP_CONFIG_FILE and TESTONTAP_MODULES_FILE. The last three must be manually
provided using the C<--_info_cmd>, C<--_info_config> and C<--_info_modules> commands in order
to allow the packed file to access the conditions in effect at the time of packing.
 
Note that this option can not be used when you already run a binary.

When a packed binary is run, any C<PERL5LIB> envvar is just dropped which is understandable, but if you find it
is needed when running the tests, set the C<TESTONTAP_PERL5LIB> to the desired value and the C<PERL5LIB> variable
will be set with that value during the running of the tests.  

=item B<--_info>, B<--_info_ppcmd>, B<--_info_ppname>, B<--_info_config> or C<--_info_modules>

Prints information about the current context - the configuration (perl -V), the modules
available (according to L<ExtUtils::Installed>), the default file name and the command line
to use for <--_pp>.

The C<--_info> is just a simple wrapper to print all information in one go.

Normally, this information is 'live'. For packed binaries however, this information is embedded at the time of
packing and read from those files.
