Revision history for JavaScript class Test.Simple.

0.29
      - As in Test::Builder 0.81_01, changed the message for extra tests run
        to show the number of tests run rather than the number extra to avoid
        the user having to do mental math. --theory
      - Fixed the test summary to be a `<pre>` tag instead of a `<div>` with a
        style attribute to make the output match. --jbisbee
      - Fixed Test.Builder so that it no longer wraps errors in a `<span>` tag
        now that we're appending to a text node (They don't don't get turned
        DOM elements). --jbisbee

      - Fixed bug with `canOK()`. It only checked objects prototype and not
        the object itself. This means that if you had this code

            function TestObject() { this.myMethod = function() {}; }
            TestObject.prototype.protoMethod = function() {};

            var testObject = new TestObject();
            canOK( testObject, 'myMethod', 'protoMethod' );

        then `canOK()` in its previous form would not find `myMethod`. It now
        actually checks to see if you pass in instantiated objects.a --jbisbee
      - Fixed a bug when testing a DOM element's `scrollTop` attribute within
        a browser harness IFRAME that is 0X0 "display: none". We now Default
        all harness `iframe`s to be both hidden and 1x1 pixels. Yes, there may
        be a little square in some browsers that don't properly hide the
        iframe, but at least tests that work outside the harness will now also
        work within it --jbisbee
      - Documented how to use `Test.Harness.Browser` without JSAN. --jbisbee
      - Fix a summary bug in `Test.Builder` -- it wasn't reporting failures!
        failed any tests, it wasn't reporting them! Thanks to Jeff Platter for
        finding and fixing this issue. --jbisbee
      - Moved source code to GitHub. Clone it from
        git://github.com/theory/js-test-simple.git!
      - Got `Test.Harness.Browser` working on Firefox again. Thanks to Nikolas
        Coukouma for pointing me at the solution.

0.28  2008-08-27T23:27:57
      - Fix line breaks in new harness output in IE. --ingy

0.27  2008-08-19T14:09:33
      - Update documentation to reflect that the `<pre>` is no longer
        required. --ingy
      - Allow '-' in linked harness file names. --ingy

0.26  2008-08-14T15:07:57
      - Changed "got/expected" to "have/want", following Schwern's lead
        with Test::Builder 2.
      - Make test names be links to individual test urls. --ingy

0.25  2008-07-08T14:07:03
      - Tweaked the MANIFEST.SKIP to not MANIFEST the MANIFEST.SKIP.

0.24  2008-07-03T00:59:14
      - Reorganized properly for CPAN by Ingy döt Net.

0.23  2008-06-19T00:00:00
      - Fixed Test.Browser to work with Konqueror. Patch from Cory Bennett.
      - Fixed a bunch of syntax errors, typos, and out-and-out broken bits,
        thanks to a run of jslint by Cory Bennett.
      - Eliminated Unicode characters from the code, as suggested by jslint.
        Of course, JavaScript is supposed to be a UTF-8 language, but who
        knows really, so it's best to be safe and let the implementation
        work with ASCII. Tests can of course still be written using Unicode.
      - Fixed a bug in `canOK` where a lack of arguments caused a `diag`
        output to be missing a class name. Caught by Cory Bennet and jslint.
      - Changed the name of the `output` variable in `Director.js` to
        `toOutput`, since `output` is apparently a builtin in Directory.
        Reported by Cory Bennett.
      - Ported to CPAN by Ingy döt Net. Initial CPAN release.

0.22  2008-04-02T03:19:48
      - Added note to the documentation of "canOK()" explaining why it doesn't
        work for objects based on prototypes created from anonymous classes.
      - Fixed CSS typo for failure output. Thanks to Kevin Frost for the spot!
      - When testing in a browser, Test::Builder now searches for an element
        with the ID "test_output" or one with the ID "test" to which to send
        the TAP output. If it doesn't exist, it creates a <pre> element with
        the id "test_output" and sends all output there. This makes it much
        easiser to harness test output, e.g., with Selenium, and it's easier
        to write tests in .html files without having to put in any kind of
        exta div at all. Suggested by Luke Closs.
      - Switched from "isPrototypeOf" to "instanceof" in "isaOK". It seems to
        work even in Safari. Patch from Marvin Humphrey.
      - Refactored test results into a separate class, rather than using an
        anonymous object. Mavin Humphrey.
      - Added support for JavaScript command-line interpreters. Patch from
        Thomas Yandell.

0.21  2005-08-29T17:16:33
      - Moved source code to JSAN Subversion repository. Check it out at
        https://svn.openjsan.org:81/users/theory/Test.Simple/!
      - Fixed Test.Harness.Browser to work with both .html and .js files in
        IE 6 SP 2.

0.20  2005-08-17T16:27:13
      - Fixed verbose test output to be complete in the harness in Safari and
        IE.
      - Fixed plan() so that it doesn't die if the object is passed with an
        unknown attribute. This can happen when JS code has altered
        Object.prototype. Reported by Rob Kinyon.
      - Fixed some errors in the POD documentation.
      - Updated JSAN to 0.10.
      - Added documentation for Test.Harness.Director, complements of
        Gordon McCreight.
      - Fixed line endings in Konqueror and Opera and any other browser
        other than MSIE that supports document.all. Reported by Rob Kinyon.
      - Added support to Test.Harness.Browser for .js test files in addition
        to .html test files. Thanks to Pawel Chmielowski for helping me to
        overcome the final obstacles to actually getting this feature to work.
      - Added missing variable declarations. Patch from Pawel Chmielowski.
      - More portable fetching of the "body" element in Test.Builder.
        Based on patch from Pawel Chmielowski.
      - Added an "encoding" attribute to Test.Harness. This is largely to
        support pure JS tests, so that the browser harness can set up the
        proper encoding for the "script" elements it creates.
      - Added support for Opera, with thanks to Pawel Chmielowski.
      - Fixed the output from skipAll in the test harness.
      - Fixed display of summary of failed tests after all tests have been run
        by the browser harness. They are now displayed in a nicely formatted
        table without a "NaN" stuck where it doesn't belong.
      - COMPATIBILITY CHANGE: The browser harness now outputs failure
        information bold-faced and red. This required changing the "output"
        argument to the outputResults() method to an object with two methods,
        pass() and fail(). Anyone using Test.Harness.outputResults() will want
        to make any changes accordingly.
      - COMPATIBILITY CHANGE: new Test.Builder() now always returns a new
        Test.Builder object instead of a singleton. If you want the singleton,
        call Test.Builder.instance(). Test.Builder.create() has been
        deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This is different
        from how Perl's Test::Builder works, but is more JavaScript-like and
        sensible, so we felt it was best to break things early on rather than
        later. Suggested by Bob Ippolito.
      - Added beginAsync() and endAsync() functions to Test.More. Suggested by
        Bob Ippolito.

0.11  2005-07-06T02:51:16
      - The browser harness now works more reliably in IE and Safari.
      - Fixed syntax errors in tests/harness.html that IE and Safari care
        about.
      - Various tweaks for Director compatibility from Gordon McCreight.
      - Removed debugging output from Test.More.canOK().
      - Fixed default output so that it doesn't re-open a closed browser
        document when there is a "test" element.
      - Added experimental Test.Harness.Director, complements of Gordon
        McCreight. This harness is subject to change.
      - Added Test.PLATFORM, containing a string defining the platform.  At
        the moment, the only platforms listed are "browser" or "director".
      - Added support for Casey West's JSAN (http://www.openjsan.org). All
        releases of Test.Simple will be on OpenJSAN from now on.
      - The iframe in the browser harness is no longer visible in IE. Thanks
        to Marshall Roch for the patch.
      - Noted addition of Test.Harness and Test.Harness.Browser in the README.

0.10  2005-06-24T04:30:24
      - Changed the signature of functions passed to output() and friends to
        accept a single argument rather than a list of arguments. This allows
        custom functions to be much simpler.
      - Added support for Macromedia Director. Patch from Gordon McCreight.
      - Backwards Incompatibility change: moved all "modules" into Test
        "namespace" by using an object for the Test namespace and assigning
        the Build() constructor to it. See http://xrl.us/fy4h for a
        description of this approach.
      - Fixed the typeOf() class method in Test.Builder to just return the
        value returned by the "typeof" operator if the class constructor is an
        anonymous function.
      - Changed "for (var in in someArray)" to 
        "for (var i = 0; i < someArray.length; i++)" for iterating through
        arrays, since the former method will break if someone has changed the
        prototype for arrays. Thanks to Bob Ippolito for the spot!
      - The default output in browsers is now to append to an element with the
        ID "test" or, failing that, to use "document.write". The use of the
        "test" element allows output to continue to be written to the browser
        window even after the document has been closed. Reported by Adam
        Kennedy.
      - Changed the default endOutput() method to be the same as the other
        outputs.
      - Backwards incompatibility change: Changed semantics of plan() so that
        it takes an object for an argument.  This allows multiple commands to
        be passed, where the object attribute keys are the command and their
        values are the arguments.
      - Backwards incompatibility change: Changed the "no_plan", "skip_all",
        and "no_diag" (in Test.More only) options to plan() to their studlyCap
        alternatives, "noPlan", "skipAll", and "noDiag". This makes them
        consistent with JavaScript attribute naming convention.
      - Added beginAsync() and endAsync() methods to Test.Builder to allow
        users to put off the ending of a script until after asynchronous tests
        have been run. Suggested by Adam Kennedy.
      - Backwards incompatibility change: Changed the signature for the
        output() method and friends to take only a single anonymous function
        as its argument. If you still need to call a method, pass an anonymous
        function that calls it appropriately.
      - Changed handling of line-endings to be browser-specific. That is, if
        the current environment is Internet Explorer, we use \r for line
        endings.  Otherwise we use \n. Although IE properly interprets \n as a
        line ending when it's passed to "document.write()", it doesn't when
        passed to a DOM text node. No idea why not.
      - Added a browser harness. Now you can run all of your tests in a single
        browser window and get a summary at the end, including a list of
        failed tests and the time spent running the tests.
      - Fixed calls to warn() in Test.More.
      - Output to the browser now causes the window to scroll when the length
        of the output is greater than the height of the window.
      - Backwards incompatibility change: Changed all instances of "Ok" to
        "OK". So this means that the new Test.More function names are
        "canOK()", "isaOK()", and "cmpOK()". Sorry 'bout that, won't happen
        again.
      - Ported to Safari (though there are issues--see the "Bugs" section
        of the Test.Harness.Browser docs for details).

0.03  2005-04-29T18:03:18
      - Removed trailing commas from 3 arrays, since IE6/Win doesn't like
        them. And now everything works in IE. Thanks to Marshall Roch for
        tracking down and nailing this problem.
      - isNum() and isntNum() in TestBuilder.js now properly convert values
        to numbers using the global Number() function.
      - CurrentTest is now properly initialized to 0 when creating a new
        TestBuilder object.
      - Values passed to like() and unlike() that are not strings now
        always fail to match the regular expression.
      - plan() now outputs better error messages.
      - isDeeply() now works better with circular and repeating references.
      - diag() is now smarter about converting objects to strings before
        outputting them.
      - Changed isEq() and isntEq() to use simple equivalence checks (== and
        !=, respectively) instead of stringified comparisons, as the
        equivalence checks are more generally useful. Use
        "cmpOk(got, 'eq', expect)" to explicitly compare stringified
    versions of values.
      - TestBuilder.create() now properly returns a new TestBuilder object
        instead of the singleton.
      - The useNumbers(), noHeader(), and noEnding() accessors will now
        properly assign a non-null value passed to them.
      - The arrays returned from summary() and details() now have the
        appropriate structures.
      - diag() now always properly adds a "#" character after newlines.
      - Added output(), failureOutput(), todoOutput(), warnOutput(), and
        endOutput() to TestBuilder to set up function reference to which to
        send output for various purposes. The first three each default to
        document.write, while warnOutput() defaults to window.alert and
        endOutput() defaults to the appendData function of a text element
        inside an element with the ID "test" or, failing that, window.write.
      - todo() and todoSkip() now properly add "#" after all newlines in their
        messages.
      - Fixed line ending escapes in diagnostics to be platform-independent.
        Bug reported by Marshall Roch.
      - Ported about a third of the tests from Test::Simple (which is how I
        caught most of the above issues). The remaining test from Test::Simple
        will be ported for the next release.
      - Removed all stack trace information from diagnostics, since there's no
        way to get file names and line numbers in JavaScript, and outtputting
        an empty file name and "line 0" was rather useless.

0.02  2005-04-12T21:00:07
      - Removed eqArray() and eqAssoc() functions from TestMore per suggestion
        from Michael Schwern. The problem is that these are not test
        functions, and so are inconsistent with the way the rest of the
        functions work. isDeeply() is the function that users really want.
      - Changed eqSet() to isSet() and made it into a real test function.
      - Implemented skip(), todoSkip(), and todo(). These are a bit different
        than the Perl originals originals so read the docs!
      - Implemented skipAll() and BAILOUT() using exceptions and an exception
        handler installed in "window.onerror".
      - The final message of a test file now properly outputs in the proper
        place. Tests must be run inside an element its "id" attribute set to
        "test", such as '<pre id="test">'. The window.onload handler will find
        it and append the final test information.
      - Implemented skipRest() in TestBuilder and TestMore. This method is
        stubbed out the Perl original, but not yet implemented there!

0.01  2005-04-07T18:17:18
      - Initial public release (alpha).
