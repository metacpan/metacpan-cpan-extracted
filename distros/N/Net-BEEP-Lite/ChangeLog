	* release 0.06

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: prevent old releases from getting into the
	MANIFEST.

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Session.pm (_read_frame): Allow for empty
	frames.  This used to erroneously assume that if the frame payload
	length was 0, there was no trailer.

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Message.pm (add_frame, _decode_mime_entity):
	suppress more "uninitialized value" warnings when there are no
	MIME headers.

	* release 0.05

2004-03-31  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Session.pm (_read_frame): Add read timeouts
	(using alarm).  This should allow servers to shutdown idle
	sessions and prevent peers from getting wedged by framing errors.

2004-02-24  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Frame.pm (_parse_header): suppress
	"uninitialized value" warnings, from Matthew Darwin <matthew -at-

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Session.pm (close_session): set the 'sock'
	member var. to undef to prevent calls to IO::Socket::is_connected
	after the the socket is known to be closed.

	* release 0.03
	
2003-10-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

2003-09-11  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* renamed to Net::BEEP::Lite.

	* MgmtProfile.pm: better piggybacked data behavior: use
	BaseProfile::start_channel_request, plus <profile> replies get
	their data stowed in the session.  Also,
	send_start_channel_request return a tuple of (channel_number,
	message).

	* Session.pm (recv_message, _recv_message, _recv_frame): add named
	parameters to this chain of routines.  The only one so far is
	"NoSEQ" which will surpress SEQ generation by _recv_frame.

	* Session.pm (_tuning_reset): added.

	* BaseProfile.pm: renamed startChannelData to
	start_channel_request and changed the result semantics to a richer
	set of options.
