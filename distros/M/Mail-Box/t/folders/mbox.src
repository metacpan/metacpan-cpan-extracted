You can convert .html to .ps using Netscape.  You can do this manually
by clicking mouse, or through '-remote' command line option.  For
example,
    netscape -remote "openURL(http://sexybabes.for.you/)" \
	     -remote "saveAs(xxx.ps, Postscript)"

You can then convert .ps to .tiff like FAX program does.

I'm trying to do the following:

1)  Take a JPEG image and size it down to a particular size.
2)  Overlay that JPEG on top of an GIF image to form a combined result.

This works fine for the most part:  I use mogrify to resize, followed by 
combine to overlay.

Now I'm presented with GIF images (the ones the JPEG is put on top of)
that have colors or other background attributes we want to 'show through'
the overlay where there is no image.

Even without any transparency options this seems to ALMOST work.  The
problem is that there's a small area around each image of 'white' that
always
shows up.  Trying transparency or the 'matte' option of '-draw' seems to
have
no effect.

Any ideas?  I'm an engineer -- not an image expert.  The images in question
are handed to me.  I can change them if necessary and if it can be done via
the ImageMagick tool.  The volume we generate makes manual changes to 
each image out of the question.

Someone on this list and my image folks here seem to confirm that the
problem
here is with 'fringe' pixels that were not trimmed back as neatly as
possible.  Any
suggestions for automating this?  This whole thing needs to be batched.  I
played
with the transparency and fuzz options with no real difference noted.
Trying 
crop 0x0 makes some of the fringe whitespace areas neater, but it doesn't
get rid
of them.

Any suggestions?

It would help me if you could send some small samples of exactly the effect
you are trying to achieve. I'm sure IM can do whatever you want but the road
to get there may not be at all obvious.

Your problem is that you are trying to use transparency, but you really want
to use alpha channel blending. I'll show you how if you can send me another
copy of MCS_C_11452.gif before it is flattened out into a GIF file. You need
to have an input file were the "image" pixels are in the RGB parts of the
file, and the "cutout" is in the "alpha" channel. The alpha channel contains
a value for each and every pixel that defines the opacity of the pixel. Two
file formats that support this are Photoshop and TIFF.

OK - here is a "possible" solution. This sequence relies on the fact that
the input image was originally composited on a white background. It takes
the image and generates a "fake" alpha channel (mask) and uses this during
the compositing operation. It looks pretty good, but has the disadvantage
that the background will tend to influence the colors in the final image
more then you would want.

: first convert to an RGB format with no more transparency or mask channel
convert -compression none MCS_C_11452.gif MCS_C_11452_rgb.bmp
: now make a fake alpha channel using a grayscale version of the image
(inverted) 
convert -compression none -colorspace gray -negate MCS_C_11452.gif
MCS_C_11452_a.bmp
: combine the original image along with the fake alpha channel onto the
background
combine -gravity south -compose over MCS_C_120x150.gif MCS_C_11452.gif
MCS_C_11452_a.bmp result.gif

Hi,

Maybe someone knows a solution, maybe for enhancement:

  I have an image (say black on white), where white is set
  to be transparent.  I can display the image on any background,
  without seeing white.
    Now I resize the image with anti-aliasing.  For that, we have
  to intermediate pixels, which also requires interpolating
  the black pixels and background pixels.
    But: I my case, the background has a different (but known) color
  every time i.e. need to anti-alias the same image to different
  backgrounds.  I would like to write:

     my $image->Read('original.gif');
     $image->Set(background => 'blue');
     $image->Scale('50%x50%');
     $image->Write('small.gif');

However, ImageMagick (ImageMagick 4.2.7, PerlMagick 4.27 on Linux)
takes as value for a transparent pixel not the value of `background',
but the color used to define a transparent color: in this case
`white'.  My image reduced as above shows white pixels on my blue
background.

  Is my expectation wrong?

  Does anyone know a work-around?

I worked on the definition of the JP2 file format.  The situation with
JPEG2000 is not at all like JPEG.

You should know is that JP2 is a very simple wrapper around the formal
JPEG2000 "codestream". It was based on the Quicktime idea of "atoms". This
simple idea is that you have a tag and a length followed by the "stuff". You
know what the "stuff" is based on the tag type. You can also nest these
atoms to build more complex structures.

JP2 is a very simple set of these atoms, most of which are optional. You
could write a program to implement this in about 15 minutes.  The "hard"
part of JP2 is the "codestream". This is the encoded JPEG2000 data. Good
luck on that. We don't have a freely available reference implementation at
this point because nobody has signed up to do it. There was an effort
underway by the same group that did the JPEG-LS implementation. This was
given to the public domain..

http://spmg.ece.ubc.ca/research/jpeg/jpeg_ls/jpegls.html

They actually had an implementation of JPEG2000 on their website but pulled
it off:

http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~mdadams/jasper/

Apparently, they decided to sell out and try to charge for it instead of
providing it to the public domain. We all know how well that is going to
work. When are people going to learn that you can't make money selling
compression software? It's not a business - its just an enabler.

My opinion is that without a "Tom Lane" type signing up to make a free
implementation available, JPEG2000 is doomed. You just don't get real
interoperability from a paper spec. We know this.

The good news is that the Digital Imaging Group (DIG) has a project underway
to do this. The bad news is that it has not yet started. And so we wait :-)

I assume you try to execute this code: use back-tics:

$result=`$mogrifypath/mogrify -geometry 96x96 $GalleryPath/tn_$ShortFilename`;

or better qx(...)

Is it just a slip of pen here, or just usual programmers-blindness?

I know this probably doesn't belong here, but
I don't who else to ask :)

Basically, I have imagemagick installed and it works
like a charm!

if I run mogrify -geometry 95x95 whatever.jpg
I get exactly what I want, except when I try
to do it from Perl...

If I in a perl script say:

sub GenerateThumb {
	$fsize = -s "$GalleryPath/$ShortFilename";
	if ($thumbmethod == 1) {
		# copy image.
		open(IMGFILE, "$GalleryPath/$ShortFilename");
		open(TNFILE, ">$GalleryPath/tn_$ShortFilename");
		binmode(IMGFILE);
		binmode(TNFILE);
		read(IMGFILE, $buffer, $fsize);
		print TNFILE $buffer;
		close(TNFILE);
		close(IMGFILE);
		chmod (0777, "$GalleryPath/tn_$ShortFilename");
		# resize it.
		$result="$mogrifypath/mogrify -geometry 96x96
$GalleryPath/tn_$ShortFilename";
	}
}

It all works great until it comes to the resizing, it just seem to skip the
last step.
the variable $mogrifypath is set correctly to /usr/bin

Does anyone what I'm doing wrong?

/Carl

Typical for installing ImageMagick binaries: they are precompiled on a
system with a long list of shared-libs.  IM is very powerful, so there
are many libs.  While starting, the libs are contacted.
   Search for a libttf.so : you may not have it, have the wrong version
or just a lacking link. ttf = True Type Fonts, and the lib is available
at freetype.org.

Compatibility between all those libs and apps will continue to haunt us.

Blindness :)

Now I'm on to the next problem though...

when I try to execute the line from the script,
my webservers error log contains this:

ld.so.1: /usr/local/bin/mogrify: fatal: libttf.so.2: open failed: No such
file or directory

I'm seriously starting to get ticked now... hehe :)

I've asked the company that I rent space from to install
PerlMagick on the box, hopefully I won't have all these
problems if they do.

Thanks for your help! :)

/Carl

The Perl::Magick and Image::Magick/ImageMagick modules are not compatible.
Just reinstall all yourself from www.ImageMagick.org.

Be warned: you have to remove the old Perl::Magick *.pm files too, otherwise
you may still use the old versions...

When I tried to write a perl script with the following line in it:
  use Image::Magick;
I get the following error-message:

  perl: error in loading shared librairies:
  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/i586-lin
  ux/auto/Image/Magick/Magick.so: undefined symbol: SetWarningHandler

Could anybody tell me what this means, and how I can get it run, I run 
Suse Linux 6.3 and I've installed Image Magick with the C++ and the Perl
Modules.

If you can afford the Digimarc library (see
http://www.digimarc.com/licensing/sdk.html &
http://www.digimarc.com/news/pr00-13.html), Bill Radcliffe
<BillR@corbis.com> can send you source for an ImageMagick module to do
professional-grade watermarking.

ImageMagick's 'combine' utility supports simplistic hidden
watermarking via its -stegano option.  If you want a visible logo, you
could use -compose to compose your logo on top of, or blended with,
the base image.  Your visible logo can be mostly transparent in order
to not disturb the image too much.

See this interesting article about digital watermarking:
http://www.spie.org/web/oer/november/nov99/cover1.html

So: gravity work differently from my well known "anchor", where
x,y defines a point and anchor the location of the point wrt the
item to be put on the background.  It was not clear from the docs.

It what you propose a feature or a designed thing?  You specify the
coordinate of the right-top (NorthEast) wrt to the right-bottom
(SouthEast).  I expect that x=0,y=0,SouthWest will work wrt to
NorthWest.  It is not logical for me to treat North/South differently
from East/West (designed before the fall of the Iron curtain?)

And also: the text still appears in black.

There is alot that is not clear in the docs.  We're writing a book due

You replied just a few seconds earlier on my message below.  I replied in
a few seconds to it... but I understand you have to scan mail that fast.
(I maintain 6 websites, so know getting large amounts of e-mail means)
Thanks for the example anyway.

As you can see in your own demo script, it is not consequent: W and E
are inside the square, while N and S are outside... in my run.  Image
attached.

I changed the line-color you yellow (stroke) which worked, but it still
does not work for the text.

The latest 5.2.0 (less than 48 hours ago directly from imagemagick.org).

Sorry, no more time to investigate for me today: have to go...

I'll send you a script that illustrates how gravity works.  The x,y
offset basically creates a bounding box within the image and the text
is placed relative to the virtual bounding box.

> And also: the text still appears in black.

Are you using ImageMagick 5.2.0?  When I used the script I sent the
text color was indeed yellow.

Hi all-

The folks at The Aims Group have added the ImageMagick mailing list to
their online mailing list archives. They have a searchable history going
back to 1996.  Very handy.

The factors are no longer really factors, but orders for a convolution
kernel, if I've understood it all correctly. Since convolution has
become available in ImageMagick, many of the old filters have been
rewritten to use a kernel (blur, sharpen, charcoal, emboss, edge).

The convert manual page mentions that good values are odd numbers
between 3 and 31.

Martien

PS. If you don't know what convolution is: apply a matrix to each pixel,
and it's surrounding neighbors covered by the matrix. The values of each
covered pixel get multiplied by the matrix cell's value, and all added
together. The new value for the target pixel is this sum. The 'order'
that I talked about above is the height and width of the matrix involved
(in ImageMagick they're always square).

Welcome to the magick-developer mailing list!

Please save this message for future reference.  Thank you.

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
you can send mail to <Majordomo@imagemagick.org> with the following
command in the body of your email message:

    unsubscribe magick-developer

or from another account, besides markov@ATComputing.nl:

    unsubscribe magick-developer markov@ATComputing.nl

If you ever need to get in contact with the owner of the list,
(if you have trouble unsubscribing, or have questions about the
list itself) send email to <owner-magick-developer@imagemagick.org> .
This is the general rule for most mailing lists when you need
to contact a human.

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

The ImageMagick mailing list (magick@wizards.dupont.com) is a low noise
and subject oriented mailing list.  The subject is the discussion of
ImageMagick software and its use.  Although the list is unmoderated, do
not post off-topic messages to the list.  Off-topic messages will
result in the offender being silently removed from the list and
prevented from rejoining.

Please follow these guidelines when posting or responding to posted
messages:

  1. postings must be related to ImageMagick, PerlMagick, CineMagick,
     or WebMagick.  Here is an example of what not to post:

       Does anyone know of a program that converts WWF to JPG on the
       Mac?

     Post these to comp.graphics instead.

  2. postings should be concise but provide enough detail for readers to
     discern what the problem is and respond with a solution.  Here is
     an example of what not to post:

       I downloaded ImageMagick and it doesn't work.  What's up?

     Yes, I have seen these messages.  More detail is needed for a
     proper response.

  3. responses should be sent to the author, and not the list, if the
     response is not of general interest.  For example,

       I'm converting libMagick to a C++ class library.  Anyone want to
       help?

     Discuss this privately with the author and make a general
     announcement when you complete your work.

  4. Only relevant portions of a message should be quoted.  Do not
     quote the entire message, for example, and give a one line
     response.

  5. Do not post administriva messages such as "How do I unsubscribe
     from the list?"  Instead, see

	 http://www.imagemagick.org/www/magick-list.html

     for help.

  6. Do not post test messages to the list.

An archive of all messages posted to the mailing list is available to peruse.
See

    ftp://ftp.wizards.dupont.com/pub/ImageMagick/mailing-list

You can also browse or search the archive.  See

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 68 major
formats) including popular formats like TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, Photo CD,
and GIF. With ImageMagick you can create images dynamically, making it
suitable for Web applications. You can also resize, rotate, sharpen,
color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your completed
work in the same or differing image format. Image processing operations
are available from the command line, as well as through C, C++, and
PERL-based programming interfaces.

Here is just a few examples of what ImageMagick can do:

    Convert an image from one format to another (e.g. TIFF to GIF) 
    Resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image 
    Create a montage of image tumbnails 
    Create a transparent image suitable for use on the Web 
    Turn a group of images into a GIF animation sequence 
    Create a composite image by combining several separate images 
    Draw shapes or text on an image 
    Decorate an image with a border or frame 
    Describe the format and characteristics of an image 

You can access ImageMagick functions directly from the command line
using the ImageMagick tools convert, mogrify, montage, combine, or
identify. Use the display program to interactively manipulate your
images or animate an image sequence from a graphical panel. Finally
you have access to the various image manipulation methods directly
from your favorite application development environment: Perl, C++, C,
or Java. These programs and much more are explained by following the
links from this page or read the ImageMagick Users Guide.

ImageMagick is known to compile and run on virtually any Unix. system and
Linux. It also runs under Windows 2000, Windows 95/98, Macintosh, VMS,
and OS2. See the install guide for compiling instructions. Pre-compiled
binaries are available for some of the more popular operating systems.

The offical ImageMagick web page is:

ImageMagick is available via ftp as

ImageMagick Tools

  display
     Display is a machine architecture independent image and display
     program.  It can display an image on any workstation display
     running an X server.  Display can read and write many of the more
     popular image formats (e.g.  JPEG, TIFF, PNM, Photo CD, etc.).
     You can perform these functions on the image:

         o load an image from a file
         o display the next image
         o display the former image
         o display a sequence of images as a slide show
         o write the image to a file
         o print the image to a Postscript printer
         o delete the image file
         o create a Visual Image Directory
         o select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
         o undo last image transformation
         o copy a region of the image
         o paste a region to the image
         o restore the image to its original size
         o refresh the image
         o half the image size
         o double the image size
         o resize the image
         o crop the image
         o cut the image
         o flop image in the horizontal direction
         o flip image in the vertical direction
         o rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
         o rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
         o rotate the image
         o shear the image
         o trim the image edges
         o invert the colors of the image
         o vary the color brightness
         o vary the color saturation
         o vary the image hue
         o gamma correct the image
         o sharpen the image contrast
         o dull the image contrast
         o perform histogram equalization on the image
         o perform histogram normalization on the image
         o negate the image colors
         o convert the image to grayscale
         o set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
         o reduce the speckles within an image
         o eliminate peak noise from an image
         o detect edges within the image
         o emboss an image
         o oil paint an image

  import
     Import reads an image from any visible window on an X server and
     outputs it as an image file.  You can capture a single window, the
     entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.  You can
     use display (see display(1)) utility for redisplay, printing,
     editing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc.  of the
     captured image.

     The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be selected
     by clicking the mouse in the desired window.  If you press a
     button and then drag, a rectangle will form which expands and
     contracts as the mouse moves.  To save the portion of the screen
     defined by the rectangle, just release the button.  The keyboard
     bell is rung once at the beginning of the screen capture and twice
     when it completes.

  animate
     Animate displays a sequence of images on any workstation display
     running an X server.  Animate first determines the hardware
     capabilities of the workstation.  If the number of unique colors
     in an image is less than or equal to the number the workstation
     can support, the image is displayed in an X window.  Otherwise the
     number of colors in the image is first reduced to match the color
     resolution of the workstation before it is displayed.

     This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits/pixel image can display
     on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device.  In most
     instances the reduced color image closely resembles the original.
     Alternatively, a monochrome or pseudo-color image sequence can
     display on a continuous-tone 24 bits/pixels device.

  montage
     Montage creates a composite image by combining several separate
     images.  The images are tiled on the composite image with the name
     of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

  convert
     Convert converts an input file using one image format to an output
     file with a differing image format. By default, the image format
     is determined by it's magic number. To specify a particular image
     format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon
     (i.e.  ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix
     (i.e. image.ps).  Specify file as - for standard input or output.
     If file has the extension .Z, the file is decoded with
     uncompress.

  mogrify
     Mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of images.  These
     transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color reduction,
     and others.  The transmogrified image overwrites the original
     image.

  identify
     describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
     files.  It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.
     The information displayed includes the scene number, the file
     name, the width and height of the image, whether the image is
     colormapped or not, the number of colors in the image, the number
     of bytes in the image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.),
     and finally the number of seconds it took to read and process the
     image.

  combine
     Combine combines images to create new images.

I have the same problem using PerlMagick 5.2.2 calling ReadImage.
However, it is only reproduceable when this statement is included in
my huge Perl program with a small IM part, not is a smaller sample
as you have.

I run Solaris 2.5.1 and all newest image-libs attached.

Did you get any useful reply which fixed your problem.
Didi you know there is a bug-list:
http://www.simplesystems.org/ImageMagick/bugs/

Please let me know.

So: to install IM, I need to have the libs installed.  To install
the libs, I need IM to be installed for Magic-config....
Ok.  Still strange spot to dump core...

I wasn't passing all the required compiler flags when building
my program. I had looked at the output of Magick-config, and
simply copied the library dependencies into a Makefile. To
successfully build, ImageMagick clients also need the correct
CFLAGS arguments, etc.

This solved my problem with a C based ImageMagick client, but
I don't know whether it is relevant for PerlMagick programs.

I located the problem in the getc() of ReadImage using PerlMagick.  I did
not succeed in creating a reduced sized example for my program which
reproduces the problem, so I'm glad I'm not the only one with this problem.

Is there are more clarity on the cause of the crash?  Any response from the
developers?

Hey List,
    This has me stumped! Maybe I am just missing something really obvious. 
I am using ImageMagick 5.2.2 and for testing puposes I am using the little 
test program on the website under the API section. No matter what I do, the 
program cores on ReadImage().

This is the program I am using to test:
http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/www/api.html

I have pointed the MagickIncarnate() function to the appropriate directory 
on my box.

Does anybody have any ideas?? What could I be doing wrong.

Here is my ouput from DBX
(dbx) step

    29     GetExceptionInfo(&exception);

The problem with general font metrics in ImageMagick is that there are
four schemes for obtaining fonts FreeType 1, FreeType 2,
Postscript/Ghostscript fonts, and X11 fonts.  Freetype returns plenty
of information associated with font metrics.  I know of no way to get
the font metrics from Ghostscript and X11 fonts returns metrics but
they do not exactly match the information returned by Freetype.
Layered on top of that is the fonts can be manipulated with an affine
matrix with varying results for the different font schemes.  Currently
I write fonts to an image that bounds the font and turn all pixels not
covered by the font lettering to transparent then composite this on top
of the image being annotated.

The only metrics available now are the maximum font height and string
width.  In Perl, for example, use

  $font->Read('label:This is a test');
  ($width,$height)=$font->Get('width','height');

I can certainly include other metric information as well but how to do
this consistently for all font schemes?  Perhaps I could retain the
font metrics for Freetype fonts only?  Or can you think of a few
specific font metrics that would be useful to you that we can get for
FreeType, X11, and Postscript fonts?  What is a minimal set of font
metrics you need to make annotating more useable?
