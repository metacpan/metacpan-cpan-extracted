This module wraps the MPFR library functions.

The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding). It
is based on the GMP multiple-precision C library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a
well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the
ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point
arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).

It also offers a wide range of trig, log, and other functions, and
constants.

MPFR, like GMP, is free. It is distributed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU Lesser GPL).

Because this module wraps the MPFR functions, it requires that both
the GMP C library and the MPFR C library have been installed.

For the GMP library see:
http://gmplib.org

For the MPFR library see:
http://www.mpfr.org

Minimum required version of gmp is gmp-4.2.0.
Minimum required version of mpfr is mpfr-3.0.0.
Some features of Math::MPFR require later versions
of the gmp and mpfr libraries.

You'll get errors if you try to build Math::MPFR against an
insufficiently recent version of the mpfr library.

To build this module you need perl 5.6.0 or later. I'm not sure of all
the requirements to get it to build with earlier versions of perl, but
it's definite that the XS code relating to operator overloading will
not compile with perl versions prior to 5.6.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

When building this module, the GMP and MPFR libraries will need to be
accessible. If those files are in a location where your compiler does
not find them by default, then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL',
you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/gmp_includes -I/path/to/mpfr_includes"
 LIBS="-L/path/to/mpfr_lib -lmpfr -L/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"

Other commandline args you may want to provide to 'perl Makefile.PL' are
D64=1 (for _Decimal64 support) and F128=1 (for __float128 support).
See the Decimal64 and Float128 sections (below).

==================================
64-bit-int and long double support
==================================

If your perl's Config reports that 'ivsize' is greater than or
equal to 8 && 'ivtype' is not 'long', then Math::MPFR will, by default,
be built with access to the mpfr_*_uj and mpfr_*_sj functions. Else,
access to those functions is, by default, denied. You can override the
default by opening up the Makefile.PL and uncommenting the appropriate
line (just a few lines down from the top of the file ... the comments
in that file should make it clear).

Similarly, if your perl's Config reports that 'nvsize' is greater than
8 then Math::MPFR will be built with access to the mpfr_*_ld functions.
Else, access to those functions is, by default, denied. Again, you can
override the default by opening up the Makefile.PL and uncommenting the
appropriate line.

I believe it to be both unnecessary and inadvisable to override the
default - but if you do find that you need to override the default,
please let me know. That you have found it necessary to override the
default is something I probably ought to know about.

I am contactable by email at sisyphus at(@) cpan dot (.) org.

=========================================================
Conversion between Math::Decimal64 and Math::MPFR objects
=========================================================

The functions Rmpfr_set_DECIMAL64 and Rmpfr_get_DECIMAL64 allow
conversion between Math::Decimal64 (_Decimal64) and Math::MPFR (mpfr_t)
objects.
For this feature to be available you firstly need a compiler that has
the _Decimal64 data type.
You'll also need to have a recent version of the mpfr library that has
been built with _Decimal64 support (ie that was configured with
'--enable-decimal-float').

This should all be detected and enabled automatically whenever these
conditions are met.

To utilise mpfr's _Decimal64 functionality you also need to install
Math::Decimal64.

If you wish to override the automated procedure you can:
1) avoid _Decimal64 support by providing D64=0 as an argument to the
   Makefile.PL - ie run 'perl Makefile.PL D64=0';
2) ensure _Decimal64 support by providing the argument D64=1.

You can aternatively override the automated procedure by
uncommenting one of a number of lines of code near the start of the
Makefile.PL. (The comments in the Makefile.PL are a clear statement
of what's required for this.)

Note that forcing 'D64=1' will not work unless the conditions
mentioned earlier in this section are met.

=========================================================
Conversion between Math::Float128 and Math::MPFR objects
=========================================================

If 'perl -V:nvtype' reports __float128, see also the section
'Conversion between __float128 NV and Math::MPFR objects', below.
This section deals only with conversion between Math::Float128 and
Math::MPFR objects - and if your nvtype is __float128 there's
probably nothing to be gained by calling on Math::Float128.

The functions Rmpfr_set_FLOAT128 and Rmpfr_get_FLOAT128 allow
conversion between Math::Float128 (__float128) and Math::MPFR (mpfr_t)
objects.
For this feature to be available you firstly need a compiler that has
the __float128 data type.
You'll also need to have a recent version (4.0.0 or later) of the mpfr
library that has been built with __float128 support (ie that was
configured with'--enable-float128').

This should all be detected and enabled automatically whenever these
conditions are met.

To utilise mpfr's __float128 functionality in this way you also need
to install Math::Float128.

If you wish to override the automated detection you can:
1) avoid __float128 support by providing F128=0 as an argument to the
   Makefile.PL - ie run 'perl Makefile.PL F128=0';
2) ensure __float128 support by providing the argument F128=1.

You can aternatively override the automated procedure by
uncommenting one of a number of lines of code near the start of the
Makefile.PL. (The comments in the Makefile.PL are a clear statement
of what's required for this.)

Note that forcing inclusion of __float128 support will not work
unless the conditions mentioned earlier in this section are met.

==========================================================
Conversion between Math::LongDouble and Math::MPFR objects
==========================================================

There are 2 functions provided for conversion between Math::LongDouble
and Math::MPFR objects:

 Rmpfr_set_LD (assign the value of a Math::LongDouble object to a
               Math::MPFR object)
 Rmpfr_get_LD (assign the value of a Math::MPFR object to a
               Math::Long Double object)

If your perl's nvtype is long double, just use Rmpfr_set_ld and
Rmpfr_get_ld instead.
Math::LongDouble provides 'long double' support for perls whose
nvtype is other than 'long double'.

=======================================================
Conversion between __float128 NV and Math::MPFR objects
=======================================================

To determine your nvtype, run 'perl -V:nvtype'.
As of perl-5.21.4 it is possible to build perl with an nvtype of
__float128. This is achieved by specifying -Dusequadmath as a
Configure arg .... but, it will not work for all architectures
and compilers.

If $Config{nvtype} specifies '__float128' && if your mpfr library
(need 4.0.0 or later) was built with --enable-float128 then you
can pass your __float128 NV values to and from Math::MPFR using
the Rmpfr_set_float128() and Rmpfr_get_float128() functions.
And the overloaded operations will also accept the __float128 NV
arguments as one would want.

This should all be detected and enabled automatically whenever these
conditions are met.
NOTE: Even if the mpfr library was not built with __float128 support
      and the conditions are therefore not met, you can still pass
      and receive __float128 values to/from Math::MPFR by instead
      using the functions Rmpfr_get_NV and Rmpfr_set_NV - but that
      happens only if your nvtype is __float128.

If you need/wish to override the automated procedure you can:
1) avoid __float128 support by providing F128=0 as an argument to the
   Makefile.PL - ie run 'perl Makefile.PL F128=0';
2) ensure __float128 support by providing the argument F128=1.

You can aternatively override the automated procedure by
uncommenting one of a number of lines of code near the start of the
Makefile.PL. (The comments in the Makefile.PL are a clear statement
of what's required for this.)

Note that forcing inclusion of __float128 support will not work
unless the conditions mentioned earlier in this section are met.
