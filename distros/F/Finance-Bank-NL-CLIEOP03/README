NAME

  Finance::Bank::NL::CLIEOP03 - Generate CLIEOP03 files for Dutch banks.

INSTALLATION

  Installation is very straightforward, just untar and do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

  At this time, there is no test suite for this module. I recommend running a
  test batch and try feeding it to your bank.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

  Thanks to Arjan Widlak for providing a patch to an issue that would cause
  a rounding error in some cases.
