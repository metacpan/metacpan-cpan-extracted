    [Added]

    - Added new test report processing script,
      CPAN::Testers::Backend::ProcessReports (thanks @jberger!)
    - Added Minion job processing system via Beam::Minion
    - Added migration for metabase cache:
      CPAN::Testers::Backend::Migrate::MetabaseCache
    - Added logging to our container files. Now all processes in the
      backend get logged to STDERR (and syslog, though our syslog is not
      configured to put those logs anywhere useful).
