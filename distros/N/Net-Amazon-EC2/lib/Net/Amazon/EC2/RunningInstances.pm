name is contactable from outside the Amazon EC2 network. 
This element remains empty until the instance enters a 
running state.

=item image_id (required)

The image id of the AMI currently running in this instance.

=item kernel_id (required)

The kernel id of the AKI currently running in this instance.

=item ramdisk_id (required)

The ramdisk id of the ARI loaded in this instance.

=item instance_id (required)

The instance id of the launched instance.

=item instance_state (required)

An Net::Amazon::EC2::InstanceState object.

=item instance_type (required)

The type of instance launched.

=item key_name (optional)

The key pair name the instance was launched with.

=item launch_time (required)

The time the instance was started.

=item placement (required)

A Net::Amazon::EC2::PlacementResponse object.

=item private_dns_name (optional)

The private DNS name assigned to the instance. This DNS 
name can only be used inside the Amazon EC2 network. 
This element remains empty until the instance enters a 
running state.

=item product_codes (optional)

An array ref of Net::Amazon::EC2::ProductCode objects.

=item reason (optional)

The reason for the most recent state transition.

=item platform (optional)

The operating system for this instance.

=item monitoring (optional)

The state of monitoring on this instance.

=item subnet_id (optional)

Specifies the subnet ID in which the instance is running (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud).

=item vpc_id (optional)

Specifies the VPC in which the instance is running (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud).

=item private_ip_address (optional)

Specifies the private IP address that is assigned to the instance (Amazon VPC).

=item ip_address (optional)

Specifies the IP address of the instance.

=item state_reason (optional)

The reason for the state change.

A Net::Amazon::EC2::StateReason object.

=item architecture (optional)

The architecture of the image.

=item root_device_name (optional)

The root device name (e.g., /dev/sda1).

=item root_device_type (optional)

The root device type used by the AMI. The AMI can use an Amazon EBS or instance store root device.

=item block_device_mapping (optional)

An array ref of Net::Amazon::EC2::BlockDeviceMapping objects.

=item tag_set (optional)

An array ref of Net::Amazon::EC2::TagSet objects.

=item name (optional)

The instance name from tags.
