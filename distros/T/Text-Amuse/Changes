Revision history for perl module Text::Amuse

1.21 2018-07-28

 - Trigger the parsing on is_bidi and attachments calls

1.20 2018-07-26

 - Introduce EXPERIMENTAL markup for RTL/LTR with <<< >>> markers
   Not documented because experimental. Seems to work, though

1.11 2018-07-04

 - Add Indonesian language support
 - Fix GH#40 (crash on corner case)

1.10 2018-04-24

 - Improve anchors restoring compatibility with Emacs Muse (#39)

   Now anchors are interpreted even if followed by material, as in
   Emacs Muse, and attach to the next block if they have no adjacent
   material.

1.01 2018-03-31

 - Removed noisy warning (thanks @labdsf)
 - Use numeric entity &#160; instead of &nbsp; (xhtml valid), thanks
   to "noname" for pointing this out.

1.00 2018-02-26

 - Revert previous change for multiparagraph footnotes (and add a
   protect for good measure).

0.99 2018-02-23

 - Use \par instead of \endgraf in multiparagraph footnotes

0.98 2018-02-03

 - Fix the latex output of full page images

0.97 2018-01-28

 - Prevent the merging of regular lines into prefixed verses (GH#34,
   thanks to @labdsf for the report)

0.96 2018-01-27

 - The code (or =code=) tag is now a verbatim tag. Any markup inside
   it will not be interpreted (including footnotes). This is a
   backward incompatible change, but the original implementation was
   wrong and not compatible with Emacs Muse.
   Thanks @labdsf for pointing that out.

0.95 2017-12-28

 - Add function to rewrite headers
 - Require min perl 5.10.1 (RT #123958)
