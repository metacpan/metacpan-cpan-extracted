DESCRIPTION

    JIRA::Client::Automated is an adapter between any automated system and
    JIRA's REST API. This module is explicitly designed to easily create
    and close issues within a JIRA instance via automated scripts.

    For example, if you run nightly batch jobs, you can use
    JIRA::Client::Automated to have those jobs automatically create issues
    in JIRA for you when the script runs into errors. You can attach error
    log files to the issues and then they'll be waiting in someone's open
    issues list when they arrive at work the next day.

    If you want to avoid creating the same issue more than once you can
    search JIRA for it first, only creating it if it doesn't exist. If it
    does already exist you can add a comment or a new error log to that
    issue.

WORKING WITH JIRA 6 Atlassian has made a very complete REST API for recent
(> 5.0) versions of JIRA. By virtue of being complete it is also somewhat
large and a little complex for the beginner. Reading their tutorials is
*highly* recommended before you start making hashes to update or transition
issues.

    https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#about

    This module was designed for the JIRA 5.2.11 REST API, as of March
    2013, but it works fine with JIRA 6.0 as well. Your mileage may vary
    with future versions.

JIRA ISSUE HASH FORMAT

    When you work with an issue in JIRA's REST API, it gives you a JSON
    file that follows this spec:

    https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-iss
    ue-post

    JIRA::Client::Automated tries to be nice to you and not make you deal
    directly with JSON. When you create a new issue, you can pass in just
    the pieces you want and "create_issue" will transform them to JSON for
    you. The same for closing and deleting issues.

    Updating and transitioning issues is more complex. Each JIRA
    installation will have different fields available for each issue type
    and transition screen and only you will know what they are. So in those
    cases you'll need to pass in an "update_hash" which will be transformed
    to the proper JSON by the method.

    An update_hash looks like this:

        { field1 => value, field2 => value2, ...}

    For example:

        {
            host_id => "example.com",
            { resolution => { name => "Resolved" } }
        }

    If you do not read JIRA's documentation about their JSON format you
    will hurt yourself banging your head against your desk in frustration
    the first few times you try to use "update_issue". Please RTFM.

    Note that even though JIRA requires JSON, JIRA::Client::Automated will
    helpfully translate it to and from regular hashes for you. You only
    pass hashes to JIRA::Client::Automated, not direct JSON.

    I recommend connecting to your JIRA server and calling "get_issue" with
    a key you know exists and then dump the result. That'll get you
    started.

METHODS

 new

        my $jira = JIRA::Client::Automated->new($url, $user, $password);

    Create a new JIRA::Client::Automated object by passing in the
    following:

      1. URL for the JIRA server, such as "http://example.atlassian.net/"

      2. Username to use to login to the JIRA server

      3. Password for that user

    All three parameters are required if your JIRA instance uses basic
    authorization, for which JIRA::Client::Automated must connect to the
    JIRA instance using some username and password. You may want to set up
    a special "auto" or "batch" username to use just for use by scripts.

    If you are using Google Account integration, the username and password
    to use are the ones you set up at the very beginning of the
    registration process and then never used again because Google logged
    you in.

    If you have other ways of authorization, like GSSAPI based
    authorization, do not provide username or password.

        my $jira = JIRA::Client::Automated->new($url);

 ua

        my $ua = $jira->ua();

    Returns the LWP::UserAgent object used to connect to the JIRA instance.
    Typically used to setup proxies or make other customizations to the
    UserAgent. For example:

        my $ua = $jira->ua();
        $ua->env_proxy();
        $ua->ssl_opts(...);
        $ua->conn_cache( LWP::ConnCache->new() );

 trace

        $jira->trace(1);       # enable
        $jira->trace(0);       # disable
        $trace = $jira->trace;

    When tracing is enabled each request and response is logged using carp.

 create

        my $issue = $jira->create({
            # Jira issue 'fields' hash
            project     => {
                key => $project,
            },
            issuetype   => {
                name => $type,      # "Bug", "Task", "SubTask", etc.
            },
            summary     => $summary,
            description => $description,
            parent      => {        # only required for a subtask
                key => $parent_key,
            },
            ...
        });

    Creating a new issue, story, task, subtask, etc.

    Returns a hash containing only the basic information about the new
    issue, or dies if there is an error. The hash looks like:

        {
            id => 24066,
            key => "TEST-57",
            self => "https://example.atlassian.net/rest/api/latest/issue/24066"
        }

    ue-post

 create_issue

        my $issue = $jira->create_issue($project, $type, $summary, $description, $fields);

    Creating a new issue requires the project key, type ("Bug", "Task",
    etc.), and a summary and description.

    The optional $fields parameter can be used to pass a reference to a
    hash of extra fields to be set when the issue is created, which avoids
    the need for a separate "update_issue" call. For example:

        $jira->create_issue($project, $type, $summary, $description, {
            labels => [ "foo", "bar" ]
        });

    This method calls "create" and return the same hash reference that it
    does.

 create_subtask

        my $subtask = $jira->create_subtask($project, $summary, $description, $parent_key);
        # or with optional subtask type
        my $subtask = $jira->create_subtask($project, $summary, $description, $parent_key, 'sub-task');

    Creating a subtask. If your JIRA instance does not call subtasks
    "Sub-task" or "sub-task", then you will need to pass in your subtask
    type.

    This method calls "create" and return the same hash reference that it
    does.

 update_issue

        $jira->update_issue($key, $field_update_hash, $update_verb_hash);

    There are two ways to express the updates you want to make to an issue.

    For simple changes you pass $field_update_hash as a reference to a hash
    of field_name => new_value pairs. For example:

        $jira->update_issue($key, { summary => $new_summary });

    That works for simple fields, but there are some, like comments, that
    can't be updated in this way. For them you need to use
    $update_verb_hash.

    The $update_verb_hash parameter allow you to express a series of
    specific operations (verbs) to be performed on each field. For example:

        $jira->update_issue($key, undef, {
            labels   => [ { remove => "test" }, { add => "another" } ],
            comments => [ { remove => { id => 10001 } } ]
        });

    The two forms of update can be combined in a single call.

    For more information see:

        L<https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-put>

 get_issue

        my $issue = $jira->get_issue($key);

    Returns details for any issue, given its key. This call returns a hash
    containing the information for the issue in JIRA's format. See "JIRA
    ISSUE HASH FORMAT" for details.

 transition_issue

        $jira->transition_issue($key, $transition);
        $jira->transition_issue($key, $transition, $update_hash);

    Transitioning an issue is what happens when you click the button that
    says "Resolve Issue" or "Start Progress" on it. Doing this from code is
    harder, but JIRA::Client::Automated makes it as easy as possible.

    You pass this method the issue key, the name of the transition or the
    target status (spacing and capitalization matter), and an optional
    update_hash containing any fields that you want to update.

  Specifying The Transition

    The provided $transition name is first matched against the available
    transitions for the $key issue ('Start Progress', 'Close Issue'). If
    there's no match then the names is matched against the available target
    status names ('Open', 'Closed'). You can use whichever is most
    appropriate. For example, in your configuration the transition names
    might vary between different kinds of projects but the status names
    might be the same. In which case scripts that are meant to work across
    multiple projects might prefer to use the status names.

    The $transition parameter can also be specified as a reference to an
    array of names. In this case the first one that matches either a
    transition name or status name is used. This makes it easier for
    scripts to work across multiple kinds of projects and/or handle the
    migration of names by allowing current and future names to be used, so
    the later change in JIRA config doesn't cause any breakage.

  Specifying Updates

    If you have required fields on the transition screen (such as
    "Resolution" for the "Resolve Issue" screen), you must pass those
    fields in as part of the update_hash or you will get an error from the
    server. See "JIRA ISSUE HASH FORMAT" for the format of the update_hash.

    (Note: it appears that in some obscure cases missing required fields
    may cause the transition to fail without causing an error from the
    server. For example a field that's required but isn't configured to
    appear on the transition screen.)

    The $update_hash is a combination of the $field_update_hash and
    $update_verb_hash parameters used by the "update_issue" method. Like
    this:

        $update_hash = {
            fields => $field_update_hash,
            update => $update_verb_hash
        };

    You can use it to express both simple field settings and more complex
    update operations. For example:

        $jira->transition_issue($key, $transition, {
            fields => { summary => $new_summary },
            update => {
                labels   => [ { remove => "test" }, { add => "another" } ],
                comments => [ { remove => { id => 10001 } } ]
            }
        });

 close_issue

        $jira->close_issue($key);
        $jira->close_issue($key, $resolve);
        $jira->close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment);
        $jira->close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment, $update_hash);
        $jira->close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment, $update_hash, $operation);

    Pass in the resolution reason and an optional comment to close an
    issue. Using this method requires that the issue is is a status where
    it can use the "Close Issue" transition (or other one, specified by
    $operation). If not, you will get an error from the server.

    Resolution ("Fixed", "Won't Fix", etc.) is only required if the issue
    hasn't already been resolved in an earlier transition. If you try to
    resolve an issue twice, you will get an error.

    If you do not supply a comment, the default value is "Issue closed by
    script".

    The $update_hash can be used to set or edit the values of other fields.

    The $operation parameter can be used to specify the closing transition
    type. This can be useful when your JIRA configuration uses nonstandard
    or localized transition and status names, e.g.

            use utf8;
            $jira->close_issue($key, $resolve, $comment, $update_hash, "Done");

    See "transition_issue" for more details.

    This method is a wrapper for "transition_issue".

 delete_issue

        $jira->delete_issue($key);

    Deleting issues is for testing your JIRA code. In real situations you
    almost always want to close unwanted issues with an "Oops!" resolution
    instead.

 create_comment

        $jira->create_comment($key, $text);

    You may use any valid JIRA markup in comment text. (This is handy for
    tables of values explaining why something in the database is wrong.)
    Note that comments are all created by the user you used to create your
    JIRA::Client::Automated object, so you'll see that name often.

 search_issues

        my @search_results = $jira->search_issues($jql, 1, 100, $fields);

    You've used JQL before, when you did an "Advanced Search" in the JIRA
    web interface. That's the only way to search via the REST API.

    This is a paged method. Pass in the starting result number and number
    of results per page and it will return issues a page at a time. If you
    know you want all of the results, you can use "all_search_results"
    instead.

    Optional parameter $fields is the arrayref containing the list of
    fields to be returned.

    This method returns a hashref containing up to five values:

      1. total => total number of results

      2. start => result number for the first result

      3. max => maximum number of results per page

      4. issues => an arrayref containing the actual found issues

      5. errors => an arrayref containing error messages

    For example, to page through all results $max at a time:

        my (@all_results, @issues);
        do {
            $results = $self->search_issues($jql, $start, $max);
            if ($results->{errors}) {
                die join "\n", @{$results->{errors}};
            }
            @issues = @{$results->{issues}};
            push @all_results, @issues;
            $start += $max;
        } until (scalar(@issues) < $max);

    (Or just use "all_search_results" instead.)

 all_search_results

        my @issues = $jira->all_search_results($jql, 1000);

    Like "search_issues", but returns all the results as an array of
    issues. You can specify the maximum number to return, but no matter
    what, it can't return more than the value of
    jira.search.views.default.max for your JIRA installation.

 get_issue_comments

        $jira->get_issue_comments($key);

    Returns arryref of all comments to the given issue.

 attach_file_to_issue

        $jira->attach_file_to_issue($key, $filename);

    This method does not let you attach a comment to the issue at the same
    time. You'll need to call "create_comment" for that.

    Watch out for file permissions! If the user running the script does not
    have permission to read the file it is trying to upload, you'll get
    weird errors.

 make_browse_url

        my $url = $jira->make_browse_url($key);

    A helper method to return the ".../browse/$key" url for the issue. It's
    handy to make emails containing lists of bugs easier to create.

    This just appends the key to the URL for the JIRA server so that you
    can click on it and go directly to that issue.

 get_link_types

        my $all_link_types = $jira->get_link_types();

    Get the arrayref of all possible link types.

 link_issues

        $jira->link_issues($from, $to, $type);

    Establish a link of the type named $type from issue key $from to issue
    key $to . Returns nothing on success; structure containing error
    messages otherwise.

 add_issue_labels

        $jira->add_issue_labels($issue_key, @labels);

    Adds one more more labels to the specified issue.

 remove_issue_labels

        $jira->remove_issue_labels($issue_key, @labels);

    Removes one more more labels from the specified issue.

 add_issue_watchers

        $jira->add_issue_watchers($key, @watchers);

    Adds watchers to the specified issue. Returns nothing if success;
    otherwise returns a structure containing error message.

 get_issue_watchers

        $jira->get_issue_watchers($key);

    Returns arryref of all watchers of the given issue.

 assign_issue

        $jira->assign_issue($key, $assignee_name);

    Assigns the issue to that person. Returns the key of the issue if it
    succeeds.

 add_issue_worklog

        $jira->add_issue_worklog($key, $worklog);

    Adds a worklog to the specified issue. Returns nothing if success;
    otherwise returns a structure containing error message.

    Sample worklog: { "comment" => "I did some work here.", "started" =>
    "2016-05-27T02:32:26.797+0000", "timeSpentSeconds" => 12000, }

 get_issue_worklogs

        $jira->get_issue_worklogs($key);

    Returns arryref of all worklogs of the given issue.

FAQ

 Why is there no object for a JIRA issue?

    Because it seemed silly. You could write such an object and give it
    methods to transition itself, close itself, etc., but when you are
    working with JIRA from batch scripts, you're never really working with
    just one issue at a time. And when you have a hundred of them, it's
    easier to not objectify them and just use JIRA::Client::Automated as a
    mediator. That said, if this is important to you, I wouldn't say no to
    a patch offering this option.
