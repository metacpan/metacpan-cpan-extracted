Revision history for Perl extension Class::Prototyped

1.13  Wed Aug 28 2013
 - Added version numbers to sub-packages to eliminate PAUSE indexer issues.

1.12  Thu Aug 22 2013
 - Updated test suite to use getSlots(undef, 'rotated') to resolve issues with
   5.18 due to the introduction of hash order randomization.

1.11  Tue Dec 18 2007
 - Fixed error in synopsis (C::P->new is correct, C::P::new isn't).  Thanks
   to Matthew Browning.
 - Added @$isa=@$isa changes to workaround @ISA issues in 5.10.0.

1.10  Tue Mar 15 2005
 - Merlyn strongly suggested that I unify the behavior of new() for named
   classes and un-named objects.  After much discussion, I concurred.  This
   is a BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE change.  Hopefully it will not affect too
   much code.  In 1.01, calling new() on an un-named object was identical
   to calling Class::Prototyped->new().  In 1.10, calling new() on an
   un-named object ALSO adds 'class*' as a slot pointing to the original
   object.  This also necessitated a change to clone.
 - Two new Class::Prototyped methods are added: clonePackage (a cross between
   clone and newPackage) and newCore (implements core object instantiation
   behavior).  If you implement either method in any of your Class::Prototyped
   code, there will be problems!
 - Fixed a bug in Class::Prototyped::Mirror::Normal::new that affected
   superable calls to C::P objects following reflection on a non-C::P object
   blessed into a C::P class.

1.01  Sat Mar 20 2004
 - Now using create_makefile_pl => 'traditional' because passthrough
   doesn't seem to work with subclassing (Thanks merlyn for reporting this)

1.00  Sat Mar 20 2004
 - Now using Module::Build!
 - Now generating PPMs as well!
 - Long live Module::Build!

0.98  Mon Jan 19 2004
 - Distribution updated to migrate Class directory into lib and update
   Manifest and Makefile.pl.

0.97  Mon Sep 22 2003
 - Slot attribute 'profile' modified to support recording
   calling location.

0.96  Tue Sep 16 2003
 - More POD changes and updates

0.95  Mon Sep 8 2003
 - Minor changes to POD
 - Minor changes to test code

0.94  Thu Jan 9 2003 (not released)
 - Rationalized and codified attribute support
 - Moved addSlots parsing/checking code into separate method from
   implementation, thus eating up a good chunk of the optimizations.
   On the other hand, this improved the handling of error conditions
   in addSlots and exposes the parsing to external code.  In addition,
   implementation of slots was moved into separate method so that the
   slots could be parsed, then modified in parsed form, and then passed
   to the implementor.
 - Cleared up bug that caused infinite recursion when non-C::P structured
   objects that inherit from C::P from call $self->reflect->super().  Using
   reflect on objects (not classes) that are not C::P structured is still
   fraught with peril, but super is at least safe.
 - Added support for defaultAttributes.
 - Unfortunately, we lost the performance battle.  Package creation is
   running slightly faster than in 0.90.  Package instantion from subs is
   running much faster.  addSlots, however, is running around 20% slower
   (it's a hard call because there are both constant and proportional terms).
   Individual calls appear to be slightly faster, but each slot handled in
   the call appears to be somewhat slower.  All in all, the optimizations
   applied have managed to keep in check the performance hits from all of the
   added functionality.
 - Added support for FIELD attribute 'autoload' (i.e. FIELD slots that are
   initialized with a subroutine reference - the first access to the FIELD
   slot causes the subroutine to be executed).  Tied interface access to
   these slots is _not_ supported for the first call.
 - Added support for the FIELD attribute 'wantarray'.  This looks at the
   wantarray value to determine whether to unwrap an array reference and
   return it as a list.
 - Added incomplete support for the METHOD attribute 'profile'.  This
   keeps track of the number of calls to this method in a C::P::Mirror
   global.

0.93  Mon Jan 6 2003 (not released)
 - Lots of attempted and somewhat successful optimizations
 - Addition of :NO_CHECK import option that eliminates additional checks
   in order to improve performance
 - More work remains to be done in this area - packages are expensive, and
   any work that can be done to optimize this would be advantageous.

0.92  Fri Jan 3 2003 (not released)
 - Added support for extended slot syntax via anonymous arrays for addSlots
 - Migrated trailing character support (second * for parent slots,
   ! on methods, & on fields) to use slot attributes.  First two
   notations maintained for backward compatibility, but deprecated.
 - Defined optimizations for extended slot syntax
 - Updated tests and documentation to use extended slot syntax
 - Updated getSlot to use extended slot syntax
 - Added support to getSlot for format parameter
 - Moved Carp::Croak lines to head of addSlots so object remains unchanged

0.91  Sun Dec 29 2002 (not released)
 - Added support for constant field slots using trailing & notation
 - Added tiedInterfacePackage to C::P::M
 - Modified C::P::new to respect return value of tiedInterfacePackage
 - tiedInterfacePackage is now read/write!
 - :TIED_INTERFACE is being removed (good riddance!)
 - tiedInterfacePackage is inherited when class packages are objectified
 - Oodles of tests on the new tied interface support
 - Tests for the new constant field slot support


0.90  Wed Dec 18 2002
 - Moved addition of DESTROY symbol table entry in newPackage into
   code guarded by check for PREFIXED package name
 - Created $parent_DESTROY search code that looks for DESTROYs that
   aren't clones of C::P::DESTROY
 - Modified destroy and DESTROY so that parent slots aren't deleted
   until the destruction sequence on an object is complete
 - Updated destroy.t to include parent** slots, more explicit scope
   ordering (which fixed test variations related to changes in the
   order in which lexicals exit scope), as well as use of field slots
 - Added more tests to super.t
 - Code passes all tests under:
   ActivePerl 804 (based on v5.8.0)
   ActivePerl 633 (based on v5.6.1)
   ActivePerl 517 (based on v5.005_03)
 - Incremented version number to 0.90 to reflect code maturity level
