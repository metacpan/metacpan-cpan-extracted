0.102   2021-08-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Bump perl minimum version from 5.10.1 to 5.14.4 because CPAN
	  Testers reports failures with <= 5.12.5 (RT#138217).


0.101   2018-03-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Mention Regexp::Pattern::JSON, Regexp::Common::json.


0.100   2018-02-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Replace \d with [0-9] [RT#124392].


0.09    2016-11-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Grok hex and octal escape in string.

	- [security] Do not use Perl's eval() for decoding string, to avoid
	  arbitrary code execution via perl quoting, e.g. this JSON '"@{[1+1]}"'
	  (reported by Андрей Шедько/ayshedko).


0.08    2016-03-31  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

        - [build] Remove Devel::NYTProf output which got included by mistake
          [RT#113476].


0.07    2016-03-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Optimization] Don't repeatedly recompile main regex pattern.


0.06    2016-03-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add some error messages so parsing failure does not just return with
          'No match' but shows more detailed error messages and input position.
          This unfortunately slows down parsing a bit (~30% for short and simple
          input, but for more complex input & longer hash/array the overall
          overhead becomes smaller e.g. < 1% because the bottleneck is no longer
          the parsing but the data structure building.


0.05    2016-02-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Tweak description and FAQ item (note about performance as of
	  0.04), mention some other JSON modules.


0.04    2016-02-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Optimization] reuse previous array/hash when building
	  array/object, this results in several times of speed increase
	  when parsing longer arrays/objects.

	- [Optimization] Move embedded code for object/array after '{'/'['
	  to avoid repeated execution.

	- [Optimization] We don't need to eval number, just use 0 + $^N.

	- Remove code that checks for duplicate key when specifying object
	  (JSON allows it).

	- Add JSON::Decode::RegexpDebug (not included in build, see the git repo
          directly). UPDATE: removed in 0.06.
