===================================

Please use DateTimeX::Fiscal::Fiscal5253 instead. That module has better
methods, more functionality, and support for 52/53 week fiscal years in
general beyond the NRF 4-5-4 calendar.

Compute dates used to create a 4-5-4 calendar from a DateTime object.

The 4-5-4 calendar is a fiscal calendar standard widely used by merchandisers
to allow easy comparisons between sales periods from year to year.  The
calendar is described at the National Retail Federation website.
