0.60  2005-03-29

	- Lots of tests added.
	- getOption() and addOption() removed and replaced by:
	  * getOptionValue() & addOptionValue() which provide automatic
	  type conversion to/from text representation
	  * getOptionRaw() & addOptionRaw() to manipulate binary format packed into strings.
	- new() now behaves differently for DHCP options, requiring text values and not packed binary values.
	- toString() now escapes unprintable characters.
	- Added methods : ciaddrRaw, giaddrRaw, siaddrRaw, yiaddrRaw that use packed binary formats. They are provided for performance enhancements when you want to avoid unnecessary type conversion.
	- Pad options (0x00) are now supported.
	- Example of DHCPLeaseQuery provided by John A. Murphy.
