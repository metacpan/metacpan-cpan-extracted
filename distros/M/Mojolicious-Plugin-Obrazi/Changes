0.11 11.06.2021 (пт) 14:34:12 EEST
    Initial release. We have a working command to generate a HTML page - a
    gallery form a directory full of images.

0.12 12.06.2021 (сб) 17:22:30 EEST
    Command: Optimised regeneration of HTML. Images are not resized again if they are
    already found in their --to_dir location. Using not slim version of jQuery
    to have some nice effects when switching images. Mentioned Chota and jQuery
    in POD. Added left and right triangle buttons for navigation becide the
    handling of left and right keypresses. Improved documentation.
    Added a LICENSE file. Added a README. Now a template can be passed on the
    command-line via --template.
