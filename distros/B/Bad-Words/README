USAGE
      my $wordref = new Bad::Words qw( new swear words );
      my $updated = $wordref->remove(qw( these words ));

      my $badwords = join '|' @$updated;

      my $paragraph= 'a bunch of text...';

      if ($paragraph =~ /($badwords)/oi) {
          print "paragraph contains badword '$1'\n";
      }

    The above regex is aggressive and will find "tit" in title. To be less
    agressive, try:

      if ($paragraph =~ /\b($badwords)\b/oi {
          print "paragraph contains badword '$1'\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: once and new store the list reference in a lexical variable
    within the module. newthrd does not do this. once returns this stored
    variable if it is already initialized. This is suitable for use in web
    servers where each httpd child has its own non-thread environment. If
    you intend to use Bad::Words in a threaded environment, do not use once
    and new, use newthrd instead.

    * $wordref = new Bad::Words qw(optional list of more words);
        This method converts all words in the combined lists to lower case,
        make the list unique, sorts it and returns a blessed reference.

          input:        a reference to or a list of
                        optional additional bad words
          return:       reference to word list

    * $wordref = once Bad::Words qw(optional list of more words);
        This method performs the new operation once and on subsequent calls,
        it just returns the pre-computed reference.

          input:        a reference to or a list of
                        optional additional bad words
          return:       reference to word list

    * $wordref = newthrd Bad::Words qw(optional list of words);
        This method recalculates the bad word list on every call.

          input:        a reference to or a list of
                        optional additional bad words
          return:       reference to word list

    * $updated = $wordref->remove list;
        This method removes words from the bad word list.

          input:        a reference to or a list of
                        words to remove from bad word list
          return:       updated reference

    * $updated = $wordref->noregex('regex string');
        This method removes all words from the list that match the 'regex
        string'. The regular expression will be used on each word in the
        list as follows:

                my $regex = shift;
                foreach(@word) {
                  remove word if $_ =~ /$regex/;
                }

          input:        'a regular expression string'
          return:       updated reference

    * $numberOfWords = $wordref->count;
        This method returns the number of unique words in the bad word list.

          input:        none
          return:       number of words
