Revision history for Perl extension C::Scan::Constants.

1.020
    - Moved author-only tests to conventional xt/author dir, with renames
    - Changed kwalitee test slightly to force a plan always

1.019
    - Fixed Win32 test bug related to lack of cppstdin (use $Config{cc} -E)
    - Made tests cross-platform
    - Made POD coverage test optional
    - Removed Makefile.PL prereqs related to POD checking
    - Updated $VERSION to best practice style
    - Updated #define in enums.h for consistency with other .h files
    - Updated Makefile.PL to have no path sep issues, and to bail gracefully (exit 0 before Makefile is created) if gcc is not found.
    - Updated Makefile.PL to reference bug tracking page and repo page

1.018
    - Fixed t/07-kwalitee.t to not have a typo in the skip directive.
    - Fixed Constants.pm to use File::Spec->tmpdir() instead of pegging
      the temp dir as /tmp (which breaks on Windows).  Thanks to Tobias Leich
      for suggesting that easy fix.
    - Added a test to t/03-extract.t to assure that we don't exclude
      constants ending in _H[_]? -- along with fixes in Constants.pm.
      Thanks to Lee Pumphret for pointing out the bug leading to this fix.
    - Fixed Makefile.PL to be more robust at cleanup time on Windows.

1.017
    - Added pod-coverage and kwalitee tests (to improve kwalitee)
    - Added ABSTRACT to Makefile.PL (to improve kwalitee)
    - Change license to "perl" instead of "Perl" to conform
      to list of valid licenses per Module::Build manpage (to improve kwalitee)
    - Updated README to make copyright disclaimer less restrictive.

1.016
    - Thanks to cpan-testers reports from Solaris platforms
      I discovered and fixed a bug in the way we handle STDERR.
      Tests in test file 03 should now pass on Solaris too.

1.015
    - Corrected broken #endif in t/include/defines.h
    - Added #ifdef __cplusplus logic in both test .h files
    - Beefed up check in extract_constants_from() so we issue a warning
      if we failed to find constants in an input .h file -- this should
      help isolate failing test cases on some platforms
    - Added Test::Pod test to improve Kwalitee
    - Added support for LICENSE in Makefile.PL in improve Kwalitee

1.014
    - Strengthened test for built-in ModPerl::CScan -- if too old,
      we force an upgrade to bundled version.
    - Updated enums.h to have a different #ifndef header/trailer -- apparently
      on some systems _ENUMS_H_ is already defined.
    - Updated defines.h the same way, just in case.

1.013
    - Fixed special case of test 02 so it passes wherever blueprint
      is installed.

1.012
    - Added Data::Flow to satisfy ModPerl::CScan prereqs.
    - Fixed copying of bundled ModPerl::CScan in Makefile.pl -- "cp -a"
      is not supported on many platforms, so using File::Copy::copy()
      in conjuntion with Perl builtin mkdir() instead.
    - Correct Pod syntax error (unbalanced =back on line 663).

1.011
    - Added contrib dir to MANIFEST

1.010
    - Adjusted suggested code snippet to have correct XS loading code

1.009
    - Adjusted documentation to properly represent version number

1.008
    - added ModPerl::CScan to this distro to avoid having to have
      the full mod_perl distro installed ahead of time
    - genericized and beefed up tests, including adding bundled .h files
    - updated author contact info throughout
    - insulated code from blueprint

0.04 - 1.007
    - arranged for constants to be forward-declared so they always
      behave as constants, instead of as barewords in some circumstances.
    - changed version to be tied to revision of .pm file.  This is
      not entirely precise but generally hits the mark.  If the
      version needs bumping at a later time due to a change somewhere
      else I'll figure out a workaround then.
    - migrated to ModPerl::CScan from C::Scan due to the fact that
      the latter fails on many .h files, whereas the former does not
    - fixed up constants to be properly mortalized


0.03
    - removed Readonly-related cruft since it's no longer used
    - added special Blueprint (proprietary build system software)
      tag to fix build-time non-warnings marked incorrectly as WARN

0.02
    - changed name to C::Scan::Constants (from original Foo::Constant)
    - extracted pertinent parts from Foo::Constant into callable functions
    - added tests for everything that is easy to test

0.01  Thu Jun  2 11:23:42 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-n Foo::Constant
