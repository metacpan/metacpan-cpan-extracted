Revision history for Term-Chrome

2.01  2018-02-20 23:40:44 CET
	- Fix reverse of Reset and attribute flags
	- Improve documentation of Reset flags
	- Repository moved to github.com/dolmen-perl5/Term-Chrome

2.00  2016-03-04 01:17:31 CET
	- Add '!' operator overloading to reverse a chrome:
           - !Bold means 'unbold',
           - !Reset is a no-op,
	   - !Red means 'reset foreground color',
           - !(Red/Blue) means 'reset foreground and background colors'
	- Chromizers: after the text, reverse the chrome instead of
	  applying a full "Reset" of the chrome. This is a BREAKING CHANGE
	  as the stringification is changing, but it is more DWIM.
	- Add 'bool' operator overloading. This allows to use '||' to set a
	  default value:   $chrome ||= Red;
	  (this was already working without the explicit overloading, except
	  under Devel::Cover, see t/50-cover-bug.t)

1.013  2016-02-17 21:58:41 CET
	- Improved doc for ${} and &{} overloading
	- Test::Synopsis is now an *optional* test dependency
	- Dédicace spéciale à Andéol !

1.012  2015-11-03 01:00:13 CET
	- Document a workaround for codulation of constants on perl < 5.21.4
	  (use a do {} around the constant)

1.011  2015-10-21 09:13:44 CEST
	- Fix t/12-codulation.t for perl >= 5.21.4

1.010  2015-10-21 01:51:21 CEST
	- Add &{} overloading ("codulate") to easily wrap some text with color
	  and Reset. Unfortunately, it is not usable in practice due a core
	  perl bug < 5.21.4.
	  This allows to build efficient "chromizers" (closures that colorize
	  and Reset).
	- Disable fallbacks for overload.pm, to reduce (dangerous) magic
	- Remove ->clone method that is useless as Term::Chrome values are
	  immutables

1.001  2014-08-24 00:43:54 EEST
	- POD: add SEE ALSO links

1.000  2014-08-23 12:35:33 EEST
        - Initial release, from Sofia, at YAPC::EU::2014
	  (Code is mature, extracted from angel-PS1)
