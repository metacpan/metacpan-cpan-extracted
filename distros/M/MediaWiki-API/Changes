Revision history for MediaWiki-API

0.52    2020-11-25
        Fix version number in POD.

0.51    2020-11-22
        Minor packaging changes.

0.50    2020-11-22
        Rework and simplify the token code using the newer MW 1.24+ api.php?action=query&meta=tokens call.
        Use a token by default for the login function (by just calling edit with action=login).
        Updated Wikipedia URLs in examples to https://
        Remove "Purge" from get_actions as it requires a POST method.
        Updated TestWiki / ExoticA URLs to https://
        Thanks to Nataraj for the Wikipedia URL changes and Sebastian for the Purge info.

0.41    2015-11-13
        When using the max_lag configuration, if max_lag_retries was reached - the reported number tries were incorrect.
        Fixed up the api->list function not continuing due to lack of rawcontinue parameter that is needed after MediaWiki 1.26.
        Thanks to Derbeth for the bug reports.

0.40    2014-09-13
        Apologies for the lack of updates and the speed to implement some fixes but I have been busy on other projects.
        Edit token code has been reworked somewhat to make it simpler, and a bugfix applied for an issue with downloading
        images over https using the buildin Download() function.

0.39    2012-05-20
        Added automatic support for handling tokens in the MediaWiki::API->Edit function for (Un)watch, Send e-mail
        and Patrol changes. (Un)watch already worked but wasn't documented.

0.38    2012-05-19
        Allow the actions the API supports with an http GET request to be configurable.
        MediaWiki::API->{config}->{get_actions} defaults to { 'query' => 1, 'logout' => 1, purge' => 1, 'paraminfo' => 1 }
        but can be added to/ammended as needed for any extensions that add additional functions to the API that support
        a GET request.
        
        Make the version of Test::More required to be 0.98 to avoid an issue with older versions missing functionality
        (eg. on centos 5.x).

0.37    2011-08-10
        The MediaWiki::API->Edit call was not getting a token correctly for an import action. Thanks to Mike Lifeguard
        for the report.

0.36    2011-08-07
        Since 1.16 MediaWiki now supports uploading files via the API, we no longer need to post directly to
        Special:Upload. Although now the MediaWiki::API->Upload function will use the api to upload if using a
        recent mediawiki, it has also been deprecated, as uploads can be done directly via the MediaWiki::API->API
        call, or if you prefer MediaWiki::API->Edit (where it will automatically get a token for you). Thanks to
        Jeremy Muhlich for the original patch. Some details about uploading files via the API / Edit calls can be
        found in the API section of the pod documentation. 
        
        There are now some tests included with the module. They run a few api functions against a test wiki -
        http://testwiki.exotica.org.uk to make sure everything is working correctly. Feel free to use this wiki for
        testing the module with your own code also. It is wiped/cleaned regularly.

0.35    2010-08-29
        The module now is a little bit more intelligent about utf-8 strings. If you have the "use utf8" pragma set in
        your code and pass utf-8 strings in the query, you no longer need to set the skip_encoding config option. The
        option is only needed if you are passing utf-8 strings but the utf-8 flag is not set on the strings. Note that
        this may not work correctly if the version of URI module is less than 1.36, and in that case you may well need
        to specify skip_encoding still (The module does contains a workaround however for older URI versions). Thanks
        to Nikolay Shaplov for patches and testing relating to this new functionality.

0.34    2010-07-25
        if skip_encoding encoding was used in conjuctions with use_http_get the querystring was not correctly encoded
        (parameters were not treated as utf8). Thanks to Nikolay Shaplov for reporting the problem.

0.33    2010-06-09
        Download function checked for image description, instead of checking for imageinfo. This meant that some
        images were not downloaded. Thanks to "ke" for reporting this problem

0.32    2010-06-05
        Config options passed when creating a new instance of the mediawiki api object were overwritten with default
        values. Now fixed. Thanks to Brian for reporting this problem. Note the version number has been bumped twice
        since I forgot to update this changes file for 0.31. oops.

0.30    2010-04-08
        MediaWiki >= 1.15.3 and MediaWiki >= 1.16.0beta2 now require a login token to be sent when logging in. Please
        see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23076 for more details. The MediaWiki::API login method is
        now adjusted to handle this automatically. Thanks to Brent Garber for the heads up and the patch which I used
        with some minor modifications.

0.29    2010-01-10
        Module will now use any proxy settings if set in the environment. To force the module not to use a proxy even
        if set there is a new configuration option MediaWiki::API->{config}->{noproxy} that can be set. Thanks to
        Andy Jenkinson for the suggestion and patch.

0.28    2009-09-09
        The skip_encoding option was ignored for the list function. Thanks to Estelle for reporting the problem.

0.27    2009-05-14
        Updated README installation instructions including some notes for building debian packages and dependencies.
        Fixed old reference to JSON::XS

0.26    2009-05-12
        A new configuration option $mw->{config}->{use_http_get} to tell the module to use http GET requests for
        those API calls that allow it. By default the module will use POST for all API requests. Fixes bug #45974.
        Switched the module to ask for the JSON module and not specifically JSON::XS. If JSON::XS is available the
        JSON module will use it by default, but if not it will fallback to a pure perl JSON parser.

0.25    2009-03-19
        Support the skip_encoding option in the list and edit calls. Thanks to Brent Garber for
        reporting this problem.

0.24    2009-01-13
        MediaWiki::API->list was returning an array instead of arraref when no results/warning from api.

0.23    2008-12-09
        Was passing parameter to Response->decoded_content as hashref instead of hash.
        Thanks to Dan Collins for the report.

0.22    2008-11-20
        Reworked the http connection and errors handling code to be more resiliant (and removed some bugs).
        Fixed up some copy and paste documentation errors.
        
        Note that this version needs some testing. It should be more resialiant than the old version,
        which in some respects had slightly wrong error handling (I was cutting corners a bit).

0.21    2008-11-20
        Fixed some errors in the documentation including one which caused the module to fail a POD check.

0.20    2008-11-19
        The retry limit was reached whether or not the mediawiki api.php returned valid data. Oops. That's what
        I get for not testing new features properly.

        Now returns the response object as part of the MediaWiki::API object in case the user wants direct access
        to data returned by the mediawiki api.php such as cookies etc.
        
        Now the API doesn't try and encode undefined parameters sent to the API, which was causing the Encode
        module to spit out warnings.
        
        Small improvement to documentation including the new features.
        
        Thanks to Dan Collins and Dan Bolser for bug reports and feedback.

0.19    2008-11-01
        Removed debug line. oops!

0.18    2008-11-01
        Fixed small error with the on_error example. It showed to use $mw->{on_error} instead of
        $mw->{config}->{on_error}.

        Improved http error messages. 

0.17    2008-10-30
        My understanding on the way rollback worked was flawed. The rollback call always rolled back the last users edit 
        for a page, whereas it should only rollback "the requested" users edits if they were the last editor for a page.
        This is now fixed. The timestamp code for editing was also broken. By default the edit call will not handle any 
        conflicts for you. When you get the contents of a page, you should save the timestamp and pass this back to the
        edit call, which will give you an error if someone else had edited the page in the meantime (or at least if their
        edit has caused a conflict)

        Big thanks to Steve Sanbeg for help/support/patches and bringing these problems to my attention.

0.16    2008-10-16
        Licensed the code under GPL v3.

        Added support for maxlag (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Maxlag_parameter). This is
        controlled with configuration options 'max_lag', 'max_lag_retries' and 'max_lag_delay'.

        There are two more configuration options to deal with http or connection problems. These are 'retries' and
        'retry_delay'.

        There is an additional error field now {error}->{stacktrace) which contains a Carp stacktrace
        to aid with debugging.

        For help on using these new configuration parameters please see the documentation.

        Thanks to Dan Collins for the maxlag suggestion/report.

0.15    2008-10-12
        Internal test release with some new options.

0.14    2008-09-21
        Module now traps and reports errors with the JSON decoding. This helps if for some reason
        api.php returns an error (such as a PHP error) rather than JSON formatted data. Thanks to Steve
        Sanbeg for this patch.

0.13    2008-08-10
        As requested by Kjell, an option has been added to the api call to skip encoding of parameters
        to utf-8.

0.12    2008-07-30
        I shouldn't rush things. Removed a debug line I left in.

0.11    2008-07-30
        Fixed a big bug where I was returning a failure when getting edit tokens if the page didn't
        exist. This certainly doesn't make sense when you are creating a page! The consequences were
        it was actually impossible to create a new page.
        Thanks to Stuart Caie for the patch. 

0.10    2008-07-14
        Some fixes to documentation examples (Were not updated after some changes in the interface).

0.09    2008-07-13
        Automatically encode API parameter values to utf-8.

0.08    2008-06-30
        A lot of releases for one day I know. Minor stuff again, but some dependencies had been left out
        of the makefile which mean't the module was failing some automatic testing. Also made the config
        options a bit more clear in the documentation.

0.07    2008-06-30
        Fixed a bug in some of the example code which was written when using XML::Simple (which meant
        a lightly different returned hash structure).

0.06    2008-06-30
        Fixed documentation to pass pod test.

0.05    2008-06-29
        Various code cleanups and fixes. Documentation improvements. Addition of download function.

0.04    2008-06-27
        Switched to json api and JSON::XS module. Faster than using XML. Added GZIP header/support.

0.03    2008-06-18
        First version. Includes some documentation for functions and probably lots of bugs.
