0.10    2012-08-03

- Fix missing prereq on MooseX::Types::Path::Class.


0.09    2012-08-02

- Added a Text::TOC::HTML->body_for_document() method. This returns the
  contents of the HTML body without the surrounding <body> and <html> tags.

- There was a bug when a document's body was retrieved before the TOC
  document. The document would not be marked up with the anchor targets needed
  for the TOC.


0.08    2012-02-19

- Require namespace::autoclean 0.12. Fixes RT #73640.


0.07    2010-11-30

- Fix a load order issue with the latest version of MooseX::Types.


0.06    2010-09-04

- If a document contained lower-level elements before higher-level, for
  example an HTML doc where the first <h3> precedes the first <h2>, then the
  TOC generation code blew up.


0.05    2010-05-29

- I explicitly removed HTML::Tidy from the list of prereqs, since as of right
  now this module almost never seems to install cleanly, and it's just an
  optional testing module anyway.


0.04    2010-05-26

- Previous releases were missing some prereqs. Hopefully this one fixes that.


0.03    2010-05-25

- Anchors cannot contain anything but letters, numbers, and a few punctuation
  characters. An anchor must start with a letter. This module now generates
  spec-compliant anchors.


0.02    2010-05-25

- Added a compilation test, because if all tests are skipped cpan testers
  report it as a failure (which is its own wtf).


0.01    2010-05-24

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
