Config::Model::models::Ssh - Configuration class Ssh

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration classes used by L<Config::Model>

This configuration class was generated from ssh_system documentation.
by L<parse-man.pl|https://github.com/dod38fr/config-model-openssh/contrib/parse-man.pl>


=head1 Elements

=head2 Host

Restricts the
following declarations (up to the next B<Host> or
B<Match> keyword) to be only for those hosts that match
one of the patterns given after the keyword. If more than
one pattern is provided, they should be separated by
whitespace. A single ’*’ as a pattern can be
used to provide global defaults for all hosts. The host is
usually the I<hostname> argument given on the command
line (see the B<CanonicalizeHostname> keyword for
exceptions).See
I<PATTERNS> for more information on patterns. I< Optional. Type hash of node of class L<Ssh::HostElement|Config::Model::models::Ssh::HostElement> .  > 

=head2 AddKeysToAgent

Specifies whether keys should
be automatically added to a running L<ssh-agent(1)>. If this
option is set to B<yes> and a key is loaded from a file,
the key and its passphrase are added to the agent with the
default lifetime, as if by L<ssh-add(1)>. If this option is set
to B<ask>, L<ssh(1)> will require confirmation using the
SSH_ASKPASS program before adding a key (see L<ssh-add(1)> for
details). If this option is set to B<confirm>, each use
of the key must be confirmed, as if the B<-c> option was
specified to L<ssh-add(1)>. If this option is set to B<no>,
no keys are added to the agent. The argument must be

system resolver handle all hostname lookups. If set to

B<ProxyCommand> or B<ProxyJump>, L<ssh(1)> will attempt

I<source_domain_list> is a pattern-list of domains that
may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization, and
I<target_domain_list> is a pattern-list of domains that
they may resolve to.For example,
"*.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com"
will allow hostnames matching "*.a.example.com" to
be canonicalized to names in the "*.b.example.com"
or "*.c.example.com" domains. I< Optional. Type uniline.  >

=head2 ControlMaster

Enables the sharing of multiple
sessions over a single network connection. When set to
B<yes>, L<ssh(1)> will listen for connections on a control
socket specified using the B<ControlPath> argument.
Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the
same B<ControlPath> with B<ControlMaster> set to
B<no> (the default). These sessions will try to reuse
the master instance’s network connection rather than
initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting
normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not
listening.Two additional
options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a
master connection but fall back to creating a new one if one
does not already exist. These options are: B<auto> and
B<autoask>. The latter requires confirmation like the

B<ControlPath> may use the tilde syntax to refer to a
user’s home directory or the tokens described in the
I<TOKENS> section. It is recommended that any
B<ControlPath> used for opportunistic connection sharing
include at least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be
placed in a directory that is not writable by other users.

identified.Specify the path to the control

will not be placed into the background, and will close as
soon as the initial client connection is closed. If set to
B<yes> or 0, then the master connection will remain in
the background indefinitely (until killed or closed via a
mechanism such as the "ssh -O exit"). If set to a
time in seconds, or a time in any of the formats documented

the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and
the application protocol is then used to determine where to
connect to from the remote machine.Currently the
SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and L<ssh(1)> will
act as a SOCKS server. Multiple forwardings may be

forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for
the agent’s Unix-domain socket) can access the local

session. It is important to note that the use of server
alive messages is very different from B<TCPKeepAlive>

encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The

If this flag is set to

to hosts whose host key has changed. This provides maximum
protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, though
it can be annoying when the I</etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts>
file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts
are frequently made. This option forces the user to manually
add all new hosts.If this flag is
set to “accept-new” then ssh will automatically
add new host keys to the user known hosts files, but will
not permit connections to hosts with changed host keys. If
this flag is set to “no” or “off”,

hosts files and allow connections to hosts with changed
hostkeys to proceed, subject to some restrictions. If this
flag is set to B<ask> (the default), new host keys will
be added to the user known host files only after the user
has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and ssh

=head2 UpdateHostKeys

Specifies whether L<ssh(1)> should
accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server
sent after authentication has completed and add them to
B<UserKnownHostsFile>. The argument must be B<yes>,
B<no> (the default) or B<ask>. Enabling this option
allows learning alternate hostkeys for a server and supports
graceful key rotation by allowing a server to send
replacement public keys before old ones are removed.
Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key used to
authenticate the host was already trusted or explicitly
accepted by the user. If B<UpdateHostKeys> is set to
B<ask>, then the user is asked to confirm the
modifications to the known_hosts file. Confirmation is
currently incompatible with B<ControlPersist>, and will
be disabled if it is enabled.Presently, only
L<sshd(8)> from OpenSSH 6.8 and greater support the
"hostkeys@openssh.com" protocol extension used to
inform the client of all the server’s hostkeys. I< Optional. Type enum. choice: 'yes', 'no', 'ask'.  >

Specifies the

name is used on different machines. This saves the trouble

=head2 VerifyHostKeyDNS

Specifies whether to verify the
remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource records. If this
option is set to B<yes>, the client will implicitly
trust keys that match a secure fingerprint from DNS.
Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this option was
set to B<ask>. If this option is set to B<ask>,
information on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the
user will still need to confirm new host keys according to
the B<StrictHostKeyChecking> option. The default is
B<no>.See also

=head2 Match

Restricts the
following declarations (up to the next B<Host> or
B<Match> keyword) to be used only when the conditions
following the B<Match> keyword are satisfied. Match
conditions are specified using one or more criteria or the
single token B<all> which always matches. The available
criteria keywords are: B<canonical>, B<exec>,
B<host>, B<originalhost>, B<user>, and
B<localuser>. The B<all> criteria must appear alone
or immediately after B<canonical>. Other criteria may be
combined arbitrarily. All criteria but B<all> and
B<canonical> require an argument. Criteria may be
negated by prepending an exclamation mark
(’!’).The other
keywords’ criteria must be single entries or
comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation
operators described in the I<PATTERNS> section. The
criteria for the B<host> keyword are matched against the
target hostname, after any substitution by the
B<Hostname> or B<CanonicalizeHostname> options. The
B<originalhost> keyword matches against the hostname as
it was specified on the command-line. The B<user>
keyword matches against the target username on the remote
host. The B<localuser> keyword matches against the name
of the local user running L<ssh(1)> (this keyword may be useful
in system-wide B<ssh_config> files). I< Optional. Type hash of node of class L<Ssh::HostElement|Config::Model::models::Ssh::HostElement> .  >
