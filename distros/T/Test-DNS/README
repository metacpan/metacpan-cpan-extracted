NAME
    Test::DNS - Test DNS queries and zone configuration

VERSION
    version 0.13

SYNOPSIS
    This module helps you write tests for DNS queries. You could test your
    domain configuration in the world or on a specific DNS server, for
    example.

        use Test::DNS;
        use Test::More tests => 4;

        my $dns = Test::DNS->new();

        $dns->is_ptr( '1.2.3.4' => 'single.ptr.record.com' );
        $dns->is_ptr( '1.2.3.4' => [ 'one.ptr.record.com', 'two.ptr.record.com' ] );
        $dns->is_ns( 'google.com' => [ map { "ns$_.google.com" } 1 .. 4 ] );
        $dns->is_a( 'ns1.google.com' => '216.239.32.10' );

        ...

DESCRIPTION
    Test::DNS allows you to run tests which translate as DNS queries. It's
    simple to use and abstracts all the difficult query checks from you. It
    has a built-in tests naming scheme so you don't really have to name your
    tests (as shown in all the examples) even though it supports the option.

        use Test::DNS;
        use Test::More tests => 1;

        my $dns = Test::DNS->new( nameservers => [ 'my.dns.server' ] );
        $dns->is_ptr( '1.1.1.1' => 'my_new.mail.server' );

    That was a complete test script that will fetch the PTR (if there is
    one), warns if it's missing one (an option you can remove via the
    *warnings* attribute) and checks against the domain you gave. You could
    also give for each test an arrayref of expected values. That's useful if
    you want to check multiple values. For example:

        use Test::DNS;
        use Test::More tests => 1;

        my $dns = Test::DNS->new();
        $dns->is_ns( 'my.domain' => [ 'ns1.my.domain', 'ns2.my.domain' ] );
        # or
        $dns->is_ns( 'my.domain' => [ map { "ns$_.my.domain" } 1 .. 5 ] );

    You can set the *follow_cname* option if your PTR returns a CNAME
    instead of an A record and you want to test the A record instead of the
    CNAME. This happened to me at least twice and fumbled my tests. I was
    expecting an A record, but got a CNAME to an A record. This is obviously
    legal DNS practices, so using the *follow_cname* attribute listed below,
    the test went with flying colors. This is a recursive CNAME to A record
    function so you could handle multiple CNAME chaining if one has such an
    odd case.

    New in version 0.04 is the option to give a hashref as the testing
    values (not including a test name as well), which makes things much
    easier to test if you want to run multiple tests and don't want to write
    multiple lines. This helps connect Test::DNS with freshly-parsed data
    (YAML/JSON/XML/etc.).

        use Test::DNS;
        use YAML 'LoadFile';
        use Test::More tests => 2;

        my $dns = Test::DNS->new();
        # running two DNS tests in one command!
        $dns->is_ns( {
            'first.domain'  => [ map { "ns$_.first.domain"  } 1 .. 4 ],
            'second.domain' => [ map { "ns$_.second.domain" } 5, 6   ],
        } );

        my $tests = LoadFile('tests.yaml');
        $dns->is_a( $tests, delete $tests->{'name'} ); # $tests is a hashref

EXPORT
    This module is completely Object Oriented, nothing is exported.

ATTRIBUTES
  nameservers($arrayref)
    Same as in Net::DNS. Sets the nameservers, accepts an arrayref.

        $dns->nameservers( [ 'IP1', 'DOMAIN' ] );

  warnings($boolean)
    Do you want to output warnings from the module (in valid TAP), such as
    when a record doesn't a query result or incorrect types?

    This helps avoid common misconfigurations. You should probably keep it,
    but if it bugs you, you can stop it using:

        $dns->warnings(0);

    Default: 1 (on).

  follow_cname($boolean)
    When fetching an A record of a domain, it may resolve to a CNAME instead
    of an A record. That would result in a false-negative of sorts, in which
    you say "well, yes, I meant the A record the CNAME record points to" but
    Test::DNS doesn't know that.

    If you want want Test::DNS to follow every CNAME recursively till it
    reaches the actual A record and compare that A record, use this option.

        $dns->follow_cname(1);

    Default: 0 (off).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  is_a( $domain, $ips, [$test_name] )
    Check the A record resolving of domain or subdomain.

    $ip can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_a( 'domain' => 'IP' );

        $dns->is_a( 'domain', [ 'IP1', 'IP2' ] );

  is_ns( $domain, $ips, [$test_name] )
    Check the NS record resolving of a domain or subdomain.

    $ip can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_ns( 'domain' => 'IP' );

        $dns->is_ns( 'domain', [ 'IP1', 'IP2' ] );

  is_ptr( $ip, $domains, [$test_name] )
    Check the PTR records of an IP.

    $domains can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_ptr( 'IP' => 'ptr.records.domain' );

        $dns->is_ptr( 'IP', [ 'first.ptr.domain', 'second.ptr.domain' ] );

  is_mx( $domain, $domains, [$test_name] )
    Check the MX records of a domain.

    $domains can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_mx( 'domain' => 'mailer.domain' );

        $dns->is_ptr( 'domain', [ 'mailer1.domain', 'mailer2.domain' ] );

  is_cname( $domain, $domains, [$test_name] )
    Check the CNAME records of a domain.

    $domains can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_cname( 'domain' => 'sub.domain' );

        $dns->is_cname( 'domain', [ 'sub1.domain', 'sub2.domain' ] );

  is_txt( $domain, $txt, [$test_name] )
    Check the TXT records of a domain.

    $txt can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_txt( 'domain' => 'v=spf1 -all' );

        $dns->is_txt( 'domain', [ 'sub1.domain', 'sub2.domain' ] );

  is_record( $type, $input, $expected, [$test_name] )
    The general function all the other is_* functions run.

    $type is the record type (CNAME, A, NS, PTR, MX, etc.).

    $input is the domain or IP you're testing.

    $expected can be an arrayref.

    $test_name is not mandatory.

        $dns->is_record( 'CNAME', 'domain', 'sub.domain', 'test_name' );

  BUILD
    Moose builder method. Do not call it or override it. :)

HASH FORMAT
    The hash format option (since version 0.04) allows you to run the tests
    using a single hashref with an optional parameter for the test_name. The
    count is no longer 1 (as it is with single tests), but each key/value
    pair represents a test case.

        # these are 2 tests
        $dns->is_ns( {
            'first.domain'  => [ map { "ns$_.first.domain"  } 1 .. 4 ],
            'second.domain' => [ map { "ns$_.second.domain" } 5, 6   ],
        } );

        # number of tests: keys %{$tests}, test name: $tests->{'name'}
        $dns->is_a( $tests, delete $tests->{'name'} ); # $tests is a hashref
