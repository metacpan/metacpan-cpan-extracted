smokebrew - Automated Perl building and installation for CPAN Testers

=head1 VERSION

version 0.48

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  smokebrew --email tester@cpan.org --builddir /home/tester/pit/build --prefix /home/tester/pit/rel \
            --perlargs "-Dusethreads" --perlargs "-Duse64bitint" --mirrors http://cpan.hexten.net/ \
            --plugin App::SmokeBrew::Plugin::CPANPLUS::YACSmoke --recent --verbose

=head1 DESCRIPTION

smokebrew is a utility that builds, installs and configures perls for CPAN testing.

It downloads, extracts, patches ( if applicable ), configures, builds, tests and installs
perl versions and runs an specified L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin> to configure the perl installation
for CPAN testing.

It accepts a number of command line switches or options options specified in a configuration file.

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over

=item C<--configfile FILE>

Specify a configuration file to use. See L</CONFIGURATION FILE> for more details.

=item C<--builddir DIRPATH>

This is a required argument. This is the directory path that smokebrew will use for building and
configuration. If the path doesn't exist it will be created.

=item C<--prefix DIRPATH>

This is a required argument. This is the directory that will be the root for perl installations.
If the path doesn't exist it will be created.

  --prefix /home/cpan/pit/rel

In C</home/cpan/pit/rel> there will be a C<perl-version> for each perl that is installed.

  /home/cpan/pit/rel/perl-5.8.9
  /home/cpan/pit/rel/perl-5.10.0

  etc.

=item C<--email EMAILADDRESS>

This is a required argument. Must be a valid email address as constrained by L<MooseX::Types::Email>.
This will be passed to the given L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin> when configuring the each perl for CPAN
Testing.

=item C<--mx MAILEXCHANGER>

This is an optional argument. Can be a FQDN, hostname or IP address and is a mail exchanger that should be
used instead of sending CPAN Test reports directly to C<perl.org> MX.
This will be passed to the given L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin> when configuring the each perl for CPAN Testing

=item C<--plugin PLUGIN>

This is a required argument. Specify the L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin> to use. Plugins are verified as installed
by using L<Module::Pluggable>. This is what will be used to configure each perl for CPAN Testing.
You may either specify the full plugin module name eg. L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin::CPANPLUS::YACSmoke> or, for
convenience, specify the last part of the plugin without the L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin> prefix,
eg. L<CPANPLUS::YACSmoke>.

=item C<--perlargs FLAG>

This is an optional argument. Specify a L<Configure> command line argument that should be passed through
when building each perl. There is no need to specify C<-Dprefix> or C<-Dusedevel> as smokebrew handles these for you.
This switch may be specified multiple times with different arguments.

  smokebrew --perlargs "-Dusethreads" --perlargs "-Duse64bitint"

This would pass the flags for building a threaded 64bit perl to L<Configure>.

=item C<--mirrors URL>

This is an optional argument. Specify the URL of a CPAN mirror that should be used for retrieving required files
during the build process and what will end up as the mirror list when the given L<App::SmokeBrew::Plugin> is run.
This switch may be specified multiple times with different arguments.

  smokebrew --mirrors http://cpan.hexten.net/ --mirrors http://cpan.cpantesters.org/

=item C<--verbose>

This an optional switch. Specify if smokebrew should produce verbose output about what it is doing.
By default it is silent.

=item C<--noclean>

This is an optional switch. Specify whether smokebrew should clean up in the C<builddir> as it
processes. The default is to be tidy.

=item C<--nozapman>

This is an optional switch. smokebrew usually removes the C<man> pages that are generated by the perl installation.
Specify this option if you wish the C<man> pages to be retained.

=item C<--skiptest>

This is an optional switch. Specify whether smokebrew should skip the C<make test> phase of building a
perl. The default is to run C<make test>.

=item C<--force>

This is an optional switch. By default if a perl installation already exists for a given perl version
smokebrew will skip over the build and configuration for that perl. Enabling this option will make
smokebrew zap the existing installation and build and configure again.

=item C<--forcecfg>

This is an optional switch. By default if a perl installation already exists for a given perl version
smokebrew will skip over the build and configuration for that perl. Enabling this option will make
smokebrew skip the build process, but enable reconfiguration.

=item C<--make MAKE>

This is an optional argument. Specify the C<make> executable that should be used. The default is C<make>.

=back

There are a number of options that allow you to specify what particular perl versions are installed.

Perls older than C<5.006> are not supported.

Perl versions C<5.6.0> and C<5.8.0> will also be filtered out as they are considered troublesome.

Without any of the following options, smokebrew will attempt to install all perls that are greater than or
equal to C<5.006> ( subject to the above filtering rules ).

Available perl releases are determined by use of L<Module::CoreList>, if you find that you haven't got
what you consider to be a full list, please update L<Module::CoreList> to latest version available from
CPAN.

=over

=item C<--recent>

This will indicate that you wish to only install C<recent> perls, which are stable perls that are greater than or
equal to C<5.8.9>. At the time of writing these were:

  5.8.9, 5.10.0, 5.10.1, 5.12.0, 5.12.1, 5.12.2, 5.12.3, 5.12.4, 5.12.5, 5.14.0, 5.14.1, 5.14.2,
  5.14.3, 5.16.0, 5.16.1 and 5.16.2

=item C<--stable>

This will indicate that you wish to only install C<stable> perls, which are perl releases with an even version number.

Examples:

  5.6.2
  5.8.9
  5.10.1
  5.12.1

=item C<--modern>

This will indicate that you wish to only install C<modern> perls, which are stable perls that are greater than or
equal to C<5.10.0>. At the time of writing these were:

  5.10.0, 5.10.1, 5.12.0, 5.12.1, 5.12.2, 5.12.3, 5.12.4, 5.12.5, 5.14.0, 5.14.1, 5.14.2,
  5.14.3, 5.16.0, 5.16.1 and 5.16.2

=item C<--latest>

This will indicate that you wish to only install the latest recent perls, which are stable perls that are greater than or
equal to C<5.8.9>. At the time of writing these were:

  5.8.9, 5.10.1, 5.12.5, 5.14.3, 5.16.2

=item C<--devel>

This will indicate that you wish to only install C<development> perls, which are perl development releases and have
an odd version number.

Examples:

  5.7.3
  5.9.5
  5.13.0

=item C<--install>

Specify a particular version of perl that you wish to install. This can be of the form C<perl-version> or C<version>.
This overrides the C<--recent>, C<--stable> and C<--devel> switches.

Example:

  --install perl-5.10.1

  --install 5.10.1

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

All the command line switches may also be specifed in a configuration file ( except C<configfile> for
obvious reasons ).

The configuration file is C<INI> style format. L<App::SmokeBrew::IniFile> a subclass of L<Config::INI::Reader>
is used to read the file.

By default smokebrew looks for a directory in your C<HOME> directory called C<.smokebrew> and for a file
called C<smokebrew.cfg> within that directory.

Setting the environment variable C<PERL5_SMOKEBREW_DIR> will affect where smokebrew looks for the C<.smokebrew>
directory.

Command line switches will override anything specified in the configuration file, including multi-value parameters.
This is a feature of L<MooseX::Getopt>.
