NAME
    MooseX::PrivateSetters - Names your accessors foo() and _set_foo()

SYNOPSIS
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::PrivateSetters;

        # make some attributes

        has 'foo' => ( is => 'rw' );
        ...

        package main;

        sub bar {
            $self = shift;
            $self->_set_foo(1) unless $self->foo
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes the
    default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
    separated into get and set methods. The get methods have the same name
    as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with "_set_".

    If you declare an attribute with a leading underscore, then the set
    method will start with "_set" (i.e. "has '_foo'" will get a setter
    called "_set_foo". Note that if you have attributes "foo" and "_foo",
    they will both get a setter called "_set_foo", so don't do that.

    If you explicitly set a "reader" or "writer" name when creating an
    attribute, then that attribute's naming scheme is left unchanged.

    Load order of this module is important. It must be "use"d after Moose.

SEE ALSO
    There are a number of similar modules on the CPAN.

  Moose
    The original. A single mutator method is generated with the same name as
    the attribute itself.

  MooseX::Accessors::ReadWritePrivate
    Changes the parsing of the "is" clause, making new options available.
    For example,

        has baz => ( is => 'rpwp', # private reader, private writer

    gets you "_get_baz()" and "_set_baz".

  MooseX::FollowPBP
    Names accessors in the style recommended by *Perl Best Practices*:
    "get_size" and "set_size".

  MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor
    Has separate methods for getting and setting. The getter has the same
    name as the attribute, and the setter is prefixed with "set_".
