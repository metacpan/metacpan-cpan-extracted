	- Re-implemented the tests using the Test::More module

	  checks to see if the question delimiter and the answer delimiter
	  are the same, and croaks if they are.

	- Added a new test for the above change, plus some additonal tests
	  to check that all subroutine error functions are working properly

	- Fixed a formatting problem within the pod
