NAME

Text::Record::Deduper - Separate complete, partial and near duplicate text records

SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Record::Deduper;

    my $deduper = new Text::Record::Deduper;

    # Find and remove entire lines that are duplicated
    $deduper->dedupe_file("orig.txt");

    # Dedupe comma separated records, duplicates defined by several fields
    $deduper->field_separator(',');
    $deduper->add_key(field_number => 1, ignore_case => 1 );
    $deduper->add_key(field_number => 2, ignore_whitespace => 1);
    # unique records go to file names_uniqs.csv, dupes to names_dupes.csv
    $deduper->dedupe_file('names.csv');

    # Find 'near' dupes by allowing for given name aliases
    my %nick_names = (Bob => 'Robert',Rob => 'Robert');
    my $near_deduper = new Text::Record::Deduper();
    $near_deduper->add_key(field_number => 2, alias => \%nick_names) or die;
    $near_deduper->dedupe_file('names.txt');

    # Create a text report, names_report.txt to identify all duplicates
    $near_deduper->report_file('names.txt',all_records => 1);

    # Find 'near' dupes in an array of records, returning references 
    # to a unique and a duplicate array
    my ($uniqs,$dupes) = $near_deduper->dedupe_array(\@some_records);

    # Create a report on unique and duplicate records
    $deduper->report_file("orig.txt",all_records => 0);


DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to take a text file of records and split it into 
a file of unique and a file of duplicate records. Deduping of arrays is
also possible.

Records are defined as a set of fields. Fields may be sepearted by spaces, 
commas, tabs or any other delimiter. Records are separated by a new line.

If no options are specifed, a duplicate will be created only when an entire
record is duplicated.

By specifying options a duplicate record is defined by which fields or partial 
fields must not occur more than once per record. There are also options to 
ignore case sensitivity, leading and trailing white space.

Additionally 'near' or 'fuzzy' duplicates can be defined. This is done by creating
aliases, such as Bob => Robert.

This module is useful for finding duplicates that have been created by
multiple data entry, or merging of similar records
