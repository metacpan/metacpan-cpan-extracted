NAME
    Data::Page::Tied - Tied interface for the Data::Page module

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Page::Tied;
      $handler = tie @data,
                 'Data::Page::Tied',
                 [qw(some data to start with)],
                 $entries_per_page,
                 $current_page;

      push @data, @more_data;
      print "first entry on page ", $handler->current_page(),
            " is ",                 $handler->first();

DEPENDENCIES
    This module depends on "Data::Page" and "Test::Simple".

DESCRIPTION
    The "Data::Page::Tied" module adds a tied interface to the
    object-oriented interface defined by Leon Brocard's "Data::Page" module.
    It also adds several methods to set and get the current page and the
    number of data items per page.

    Please read Data::Page as "Data::Page::Tied" inherits all methods from
    "Data::Page".

    The tying constructor has the following syntax:

      tie @ary, 'Data::Page::Tied', ARRAYREF,
                INTEGER,            INTEGER;

    Where the referenced array may contain any data to start with and the
    integers denote the number of entries per page and the current page
    respectively.

  Methods
    new This is the constructor. It is invoked by the tied interface, but
        using it directly allows for two distinct ways of creating new
        objects:

        You may use the same syntax as the tied interface or you may use the
        following syntax to get an ordinary "Data::Page" object instead of a
        "Data::Page::Tied" object:

          Data::Page::Tied->new( INTEGER, @args );

        Where the integer is the number of elements.

    total_entries
        This method returns the number of items in the tied array.

    set_current_page
        This method sets the current page. You may find the current page by
        using the inherited "current_page" method.

    set_entries_per_page
        This method sets the number of items displayed per page. You may
        find the current number of items displayed per page by using the
        inherited "entries_per_page" method.

    entry
        This accessor is used to get or set any specific entry. It takes one
        or two arguments. The first argument is always the array index and
        the second (optional) argument is the value you want to set
        $array[$index] to.

    set_entry
        Additional method to make the interface more consistent. Takes two
        arguments. See entry.
