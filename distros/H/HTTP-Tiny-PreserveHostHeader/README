NAME

    HTTP::Tiny::PreserveHostHeader - Preserve Host header on requests

SYNOPSIS

        use HTTP::Tiny::PreserveHostHeader;
    
        my $response = HTTP::Tiny::PreserveHostHeader->new->get(
            'http://example.com', {
                headers => {
                    Host => 'example.net',
                }
            }
        );

DESCRIPTION

    This module extends HTTP::Tiny and allows to preserve original Host
    header from HTTP request.

    The HTTP::Tiny is strictly compatible with HTTP 1.1 spec, section
    14.23:

      The Host field value MUST represent the naming authority of the
      origin server or gateway given by the original URL.

    It means that HTTP::Tiny always rewrite Host header to the value taken
    from URL.

    Some non-standard HTTP clients, such as reverse HTTP proxy, need to
    override Host header to other value.
