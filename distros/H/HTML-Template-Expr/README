HTML::Template::Expr version 0.05
=================================

CHANGES

- Added a compatibility fix required by HTML::Template v2.8.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides an extension to HTML::Template which allows
expressions in the template syntax.  This is purely an addition - all
the normal HTML::Template options, syntax and behaviors will still
work.  See L<HTML::Template> for details.

Expression support includes comparisons, math operations, string
operations and a mechanism to allow you add your own functions at
runtime.
