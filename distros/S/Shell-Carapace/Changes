    - Another attempt to deal with open2pty() failures correctly.

    - Retry if open2pty() fails and then die if it fails again.

0.20 2015-12-21T19:15:26Z

0.19 2015-12-21T16:16:21Z
    - Don't connect to remote host lazily -- connect on instantiation.

0.18 2015-12-15T13:46:06Z
    - Added Test::Fatal to the cpanfile
    - Made Minilla a 'develop' dependency in the cpanfile

0.17 2015-12-15T13:39:24Z
    - Die if ssh connection can't be established.

0.16 2015-11-15T23:48:14Z
    - Pass command to callback on error

0.15 2015-11-15T02:27:26Z
    - Skip t/ssh.t

0.14 2015-11-15T02:22:03Z
    - Now passing a hostname to the callback

0.13 2015-09-07T03:05:55Z
    - Major rewrite.  Not backwards compatible at all.  Splits module into two
      parts -- Shell::Carapace::Shell and Shell::Carapace::SSH.

0.12 2015-09-05T20:20:50Z
    - Major rewrite.  Not backwards compatible at all.  Introduces callback
      concept.

0.11 2015-03-24T23:45:49Z
    - Die noisely

0.10 2015-02-24T22:02:17Z
    - Made print_cmd attribute read/write.

0.09 2015-02-18T20:30:00Z
    - Tee output to the log file.  This time the exit code is preserved.

0.08 2015-02-18T15:42:16Z
    - Revert most of 0.07.  Piping to tee means we can't know what the exit
      code of the command is.  Added a test so this case isn't missed in the
      future.

0.07 2015-02-18T00:56:10Z
    - Pipe command to tee by default so logfile is written to in realtime.

0.06 2015-02-12T15:28:05Z
    - Die earlier if logfile has bad permissions

0.05 2015-02-12T00:09:13Z
    - Don't use 'coerce => 1' so Shell::Carapace is compatible with 
      Moo <1.006000

    - Allow logfile attr to be undef

0.03 2015-02-09T14:25:24Z

0.02 2015-02-09T11:06:44Z
