Linux-Setns
========================

setns is used to change the current namespace of the process by specifying a file descriptor to a currently available namespace.

So you must provide a file descriptor and a type (CLONE_ALL, CLONE_NEWIPC, CLONE_NEWNET, CLONE_NEWPID, CLONE_NEWUSER, CLONE_NEWUTS and CLONE_NEWCGROUP).

On successfull execution your process will now be in the desired namespace.
In case of failure, error message is printed to STDOUT.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module does not require any 3rd party libraries, but it does require your machine to have SYS_setns in <sys/syscall.h> for build.
And also it requires fairly recent kernel to work.

The interface to setns() changed between 0.05 and 1.00.

Version before 1.00 does not work on machines with older glibc.

CLONE_NEWCGROUP is available only on 4.6 and newer kernels.
