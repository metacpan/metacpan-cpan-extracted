NAME
    Getopt::Tree - Get tree-like options (like the route command).

ABSTRACT
    Getopt::Tree is a module to help parse and validate command line
    parameters built on top of Getopt::Long. Getopt::Tree allows the
    developer to specify an array parameters, including the name,
    abbreviation, type, description, and any parameters that are applicable
    to and/or dependent on that parameter.

EXAMPLE
  Simple "route" example
     # Accept the commands add, remove, print, and their associated dependent
     # options.
     my $p = [
         {
             name     => 'add',
             exists   => 1,
             descr    => 'Add a new route',
             params   => [
                 {
                     name => 'gateway',
                     abbr => 'gw',
                     descr => 'Remote gateway for this network',
                 },
                 {
                     name => 'network',
                     abbr => 'net',
                     descr => 'Network address to add route for',
                 },
                 {
                     name => 'subnet',
                     abbr => 'mask',
                     descr => 'Subnet mask for the given network',
                 },
             ],
         },
         {
             name     => 'remove',
             abbr     => 'delete',
             exists   => 1,
             descr    => 'Delete a route',
             params   => [
                 {
                     name => 'network',
                     abbr => 'net',
                     descr => 'Network address to delete',
                 },
                 {
                     name => 'subnet',
                     abbr => 'mask',
                     descr => 'Subnet mask for the given network',
                 },
             ],
         },
         {
             name     => 'print',
             exists   => 1,
             descr    => 'Display routing table',
         }, 
     ];

     ];
     my ( $operation, $params ) = parse_command_line( $p );
     if ( !$operation ) { print_usage( $p ); die; }
     print "Performing $operation!\n"

USAGE
    Two functions are exported by default: parse_command_line and
    print_usage.

  Functions
   parse_command_line
    Parses the command line (@ARGV) based on the specified data structure.

    Accepts two parameters. The first is a required array reference
    describing the possible command line parameters. It returns three
    values, the "top level" option, a hashref of the other specified
    options, and an arrayref of any remaining unparsed options (similar to
    Getopt::Long).

    The second parameter is an optional array reference or string from which
    the parameters are to be read, rather than reading them from @ARGV. If a
    string is passed, it will be converted to an array via
    "Text::ParseWords::shellwords".

    If the command line was unable to be parsed (the passed data structure
    was inconsistent, etc), parse_command_line will die with an appropriate
    error message. If the command line was invalid (the user entered
    something that did not meet the given requirements, etc) a warning will
    be printed and undef will be returned.

   print_usage
    Prints usage information based on the specified data structure.

    Takes two parameters, the first is a required array reference describing
    the possible command line parameters, and the second is an optional file
    handle to which the usage information will be printed. Alternately, in
    place of a filehandle, a hashref of options can be passed. Valid options
    are:

    fh  The filehandle to print to. If not set, no output is printed.

    return
        A boolean value that determines whether or not the usage should be
        returned as a string.

    wrap_at
        Number of characters to wrap the output at. Will be auto-detected
        from $ENV{COLUMNS} if not set, defaults to 80 if auto-detection
        fails.

    hide_top_line
        Hides the top line of output which contains the program name how to
        pass switches.

    Usage information is generated mostly from the "descr" fields in the
    data structure, indentation is based on parameter dependence, parameters
    that accept values are noted, and optional parameters are presented
    inside of brackets.

  Configuration
    The "expected command line configuration data structure" will be
    referred to as "the data structure" because I can't think of a better
    name for it.

   Concepts
    The design is similar to the Unix "route" command, in which a "top
    level" command (such as "add" or "delete") will have zero or more
    dependent parameters (such as the "gateway" or "subnet"). Getopt::Tree
    uses Getopt::Long to actually parse the command line, but adds a layer
    of logic on top to discover which top level command and dependent
    options the user specified. Conflicting options, parameter types, and
    usage document generation are all handled by Getopt::Tree based on the
    data structure supplied by the developer.

    Commands are separated into two types, top level and dependent. At least
    on top level command is required. Once Getopt::Tree identifies the
    proper top level command, it will look for the dependent commands that
    apply to the specified top level command. Since each dependent command
    can also have dependent commands, the process is repeated until no more
    commands are found.

    Each set of dependents in the tree is considered a "level", with the top
    level being the first set of entries in the structure, and each
    successive level being composed of the dependents of the prior level.
    Note that a level could simply be described as the distance to the top
    of a tree, where as a "branch" would be the specific set of dependents
    for a given command, irrespective of dependents of commands on the same
    level.

   Data Structure
    The data structure is composed of an array of hashrefs. Each hashref
    describes a single parameter. Each hashref in the array contains various
    options describing the parameter. Valid options are as follows:

   name
    Full parameter name. Required. Must not contain the characters "@", "|",
    or "=" and must not conflict with other names or abbreviations in the
    same branch. This is the name that will be returned, if the parameter is
    set, by parse_command_line.

   abbr
    Parameter abbreviation. Will be accepted on the command line in place of
    the proper name, but must obey the same rules as the proper name.

   optional
    Defines whether this parameter is optional. Boolean. Defaults to false,
    ie, the parameter is required.

   exists
    Defines whether or not the parameter has a value or whether it should
    simply be checked for existence. Boolean. Defaults to false, ie, the
    parameter must have a value.

   leaf
    Defines whether or not the parameter should be considered a "leaf" on
    the current branch or not. A leaf is a required parameter at the current
    level and has no dependents. Useful to place a required parameter that
    applies to multiple branches without specifying the required parameter
    in each branch. Conflicts with "optional" and "params". Defaults to
    false, ie, this parameter is not a leaf.

   params
    An optional arrayref of hashrefs representing parameters dependent on
    this parameter. Format is exactly the same as for the primary data
    structure.

   descr
    Textural description of what the parameter is and does. Used as part of
    the usage information. If not set, a placeholder is supplied.

   multi
    Defines whether or not this parameter can be specified multiple times or
    not. Boolean. Defaults to false.

   re
    Defines a regular expression to match values against. The result of the
    first capture of this expression will be treated as the value in place
    of the user-specified value. If no capture is found or the match fails,
    the parameter will be treated as invalid. Conflicts with "exists". If
    both "re" and "eval" are specified, "re" will be processed first and the
    result passed to "eval".

   eval
    Defines a subroutine to be called to validate the value passed for this
    parameter. The returned value from the subroutine will be used in place
    of the user-specified value. If undef is returned, the parameter is
    treated as invalid. Conflicts with "exists". If both "re" and "eval" are
    specified, "re" will be processed first and the result passed to "eval".

VARIABLES
  $Getopt::Tree::USAGE_HEADER
    Text to be printed near the top of the "usage" output.

  $Getopt::Tree::USAGE_HEADER
    Text to be printed at the end of the "usage" output.

  $Getopt::Tree::SWITCH_PREFIX_STR
    Characters to prefix a switch. Defaults to a single hyphen ('-'). Can be
    set to an empty string to use switchless options (Note: This option is
    not well tested!).

NOTES
    You can't have a dependent parameter of the same name as a non-optional
    parameter higher in the tree. If the parser sees a two instances of the
    same parameter it will bail, so you have to make sure that there are no
    identically named parameters in one part of the tree as in another part
    of the tree that the parser passes through. Example:

     { name => 'bad' },
     { name => 'normal', params => [ { name => 'bad' }, { name => 'bad2' } ] }
     { name => 'normal2', params => [ { name => 'bad2' } ] }

    Both of the 'bad' entries will collide when the user specifies 'normal',
    since the parser passes through the top level and the normal->params
    level. However, bad2 will never collide because the parser will never
    pass through both levels.

    Also, identical abbreviations are not checked for or corrected. They
    will probably cause problems.

    Appease older versions of Perl in print_usage's usage of square brackets
    in a string.

  Version 1.10, 20100709, jeagle
    Correct handling of eval flags mixed with other flags.

    Add optional destination filehandle to print_usage.
