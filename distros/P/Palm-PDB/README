Palm-PDB version 1.400, released March 7, 2015

This distribution contains Palm::PDB and Palm::Raw, a pair of Perl 5
modules for reading, manipulating, and writing the .pdb and .prc
database files used by PalmOS devices such as the PalmPilot and its
successors.

These 2 modules were historically part of the p5-Palm distribution,
which is now just called Palm.  They have been split off into their
own distribution because they are also useful for manipulating the
Mobipocket e-book format, which is also used for Amazon Kindle books.



INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install



CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 1.400 of Palm-PDB:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- Bump version number to be greater than all previous releases.
	  Palm::PDB 1.36 was released in p5-Palm 1.008, but p5-Palm 1.009
	  contained Palm::PDB 1.009.  Version numbers shouldn't go backwards.
