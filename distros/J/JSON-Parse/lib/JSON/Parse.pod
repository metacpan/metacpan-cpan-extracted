=head1 NAME

JSON::Parse - Read JSON into a Perl variable

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    
    use JSON::Parse 'parse_json';
    my $json = '["golden", "fleece"]';
    my $perl = parse_json ($json);
    # Same effect as $perl = ['golden', 'fleece'];
    


Convert JSON into Perl.

=head1 VERSION

This documents version 0.57 of JSON::Parse corresponding to
L<git commit 42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/commit/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152> released on Thu Jul 9 07:16:33 2020 +0900.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module for parsing JSON. (JSON means "JavaScript Object Notation"
and it is specified in L</RFC 7159>.)

JSON::Parse offers the function L</parse_json>, which takes a string
containing JSON, and returns an equivalent Perl structure. It also
offers validation of JSON via L</valid_json>, which returns true or
false depending on whether the JSON is correct or not, and
L</assert_valid_json>, which produces a descriptive fatal error if the
JSON is invalid. A function L</json_file_to_perl> reads JSON from a
file, and there is a safer version of L</parse_json> called
L</parse_json_safe> which doesn't throw exceptions.

For special cases of parsing, there are also methods L</new> and
L</run>, which create a JSON parsing object and run it on text. See
L</METHODS>.

JSON::Parse accepts only UTF-8 as input. See L</UTF-8 only> and
L</Handling of Unicode>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 parse_json

    use JSON::Parse 'parse_json';
    my $perl = parse_json ('{"x":1, "y":2}');

This function converts JSON into a Perl structure, either an array
reference, a hash reference, or a scalar.

If the first argument does not contain a complete valid JSON text, is
the undefined value, an empty string, or a string containing only
whitespace C<parse_json> throws a fatal error ("dies").

If the argument contains valid JSON, the return value is either a hash
reference, an array reference, or a scalar. If the input JSON text is
a serialized object, a hash reference is returned:

    
    use JSON::Parse ':all';
    my $perl = parse_json ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
    print ref $perl, "\n";
    


produces output

    HASH


(This example is included as L<F<hash.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/hash.pl> in the distribution.)


If the input JSON text is a serialized array, an array reference is
returned:

    
    use JSON::Parse ':all';
    my $perl = parse_json ('["a", "b", "c"]');
    print ref $perl, "\n";
    


produces output

    ARRAY


(This example is included as L<F<array.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/array.pl> in the distribution.)


Otherwise a Perl scalar is returned. 

The behaviour of allowing a scalar was added in version 0.32 of this
module. This brings it into line with the new specification for
JSON. The behaviour of disallowing empty inputs was changed in version
0.49. This makes it conform to the L</JSON Parsing Test Suite>.

The function L</parse_json_safe> offers a version of this function
with various safety features enabled.

=head2 json_file_to_perl

    use JSON::Parse 'json_file_to_perl';
    my $p = json_file_to_perl ('filename');

This is exactly the same as L</parse_json> except that it reads the
JSON from the specified file rather than a scalar. The file must be in
the UTF-8 encoding, and is opened as a character file using
C<:encoding(UTF-8)> (see L<PerlIO::encoding> and L<perluniintro> for
details). The output is marked as character strings.

This is a convenience function written in Perl. You may prefer to read
the file yourself using another module if you need faster performance.

=head2 valid_json

    use JSON::Parse 'valid_json';
    if (valid_json ($json)) {
        # do something
    }

C<valid_json> returns I<1> if its argument is valid JSON and I<0> if
not. It runs several times faster than L</parse_json>. This gain in
speed is obtained because it discards the input data after reading it,
rather than storing it into Perl variables.

This does not supply the actual errors which caused invalidity. Use
L</assert_valid_json> to get error messages when the JSON is invalid.

This cannot detect key collisions in the JSON since it does not store
values. See L</Key collisions> for more on this module's handling of
non-unique names in the JSON.

=head2 assert_valid_json

    
    use JSON::Parse 'assert_valid_json';
    eval {
        assert_valid_json ('["xyz":"b"]');
    };
    if ($@) {
        print "Your JSON was invalid: $@\n";
    }
    # Prints "Unexpected character ':' parsing array"


produces output

    Your JSON was invalid: JSON error at line 1, byte 7/11: Unexpected character ':' parsing array starting from byte 1: expecting whitespace: '\n', '\r', '\t', ' ' or comma: ',' or end of array: ']' at /usr/home/ben/projects/Json3/examples/assert.pl line 6.
    


(This example is included as L<F<assert.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/assert.pl> in the distribution.)


This is the underlying function for L</valid_json>. It runs at the
same speed, but it throws an error if the JSON is wrong, rather than
returning 1 or 0. See L</DIAGNOSTICS> for the error format, which is
identical to L</parse_json>.

This cannot detect key collisions in the JSON since it does not store
values. See L</Key collisions> for more on this module's handling of
non-unique names in the JSON.

The behaviour of disallowing empty inputs was changed in version
0.49. This makes it conform to the L</JSON Parsing Test Suite>, and
also makes it give identical results to L</valid_json>.

=head2 parse_json_safe

This is almost the same thing as L</parse_json>, but has the following
differences:

=over

=item Does not throw exceptions

If the JSON is invalid, a warning is printed and the undefined value
is returned, as if calling L</parse_json> like this:

    eval {
        $out = parse_json ($json);
    };
    if ($@) {
        carp $@;
	$out = undef;
    }

=item Detects key collisions

This switches on L</detect_collisions>, so that if the JSON contains
non-unique names, a warning is printed and the undefined value is
returned. See L</Key collisions> for an explanation of what a key
collision is.

=item Booleans are not read-only

This switches on L</copy_literals> so that JSON true, false and null
values are copied. These values can be modified, but they will not be
converted back into C<true> and C<false> by L<JSON::Create>.

=item Errors are reported by carp

Parsing errors are reported by L<Carp/carp>, so the error line number
refers to the caller's line.

=back

As the name implies, this is meant to be a "safety-first" version of
L</parse_json>. This function does not pass all of the tests of the
L</JSON Parsing Test Suite>, because it creates an error for duplicate
keys in objects, which is legal JSON. See F<t/jpts.t> for details.

This function was added in version 0.38.

=head1 OLD INTERFACE

The following alternative function names are accepted. These are the
names used for the functions in old versions of this module. These
names are not deprecated and will never be removed from the module.

=head2 json_to_perl

This is exactly the same function as L</parse_json>.

=head2 validate_json

This is exactly the same function as L</assert_valid_json>.

=head1 Mapping from JSON to Perl

JSON elements are mapped to Perl as follows:

=head2 JSON numbers

JSON numbers become Perl numbers, either integers or double-precision
floating point numbers, or possibly strings containing the number if
parsing of a number by the usual methods fails somehow.

JSON does not allow leading zeros, like I<0123>, or leading plus
signs, like I<+100>, in numbers, so these cause an L</Unexpected
character> error. JSON also does not allow numbers of the form I<1.>,
but it does allow things like I<0e0> or I<1E999999>. As far as
possible these are accepted by JSON::Parse.

=head2 JSON strings

JSON strings become Perl strings. The JSON escape characters such as
C<\t> for the tab character (see section 2.5 of L</RFC 7159>) are
mapped to the equivalent ASCII character.

=head3 Handling of Unicode

Inputs must be in the UTF-8 format. See L</UTF-8 only>.

If the input to L</parse_json> is marked as Unicode characters, the
output strings will be marked as Unicode characters. If the input is
not marked as Unicode characters, the output strings will not be
marked as Unicode characters. Thus, 

    
    use JSON::Parse ':all';
    # The scalar $sasori looks like Unicode to Perl
    use utf8;
    my $sasori = '["蠍"]';
    my $p = parse_json ($sasori);
    print utf8::is_utf8 ($p->[0]);
    # Prints 1.
    


but

    
    use JSON::Parse ':all';
    # The scalar $ebi does not look like Unicode to Perl
    no utf8;
    my $ebi = '["海老"]';
    my $p = parse_json ($ebi);
    print utf8::is_utf8 ($p->[0]);
    # Prints nothing.
    


Escapes of the form \uXXXX (see page three of L</RFC 7159>) are mapped
to ASCII if XXXX is less than 0x80, or to UTF-8 if XXXX is greater
than or equal to 0x80.

Strings containing \uXXXX escapes greater than 0x80 are also upgraded
to character strings, regardless of whether the input is a character
string or a byte string, thus regardless of whether Perl thinks the
input string is Unicode, escapes like \u87f9 are converted into the
equivalent UTF-8 bytes and the particular string in which they occur
is marked as a character string:

    
    use JSON::Parse ':all';
    no utf8;
    # 蟹
    my $kani = '["\u87f9"]';
    my $p = parse_json ($kani);
    print "It's marked as a character string" if utf8::is_utf8 ($p->[0]);
    # Prints "It's marked as a character string" because it's upgraded
    # regardless of the input string's flags.


This is modelled on the behaviour of Perl's C<chr>:

    
    no utf8;
    my $kani = '87f9';
    print "hex is character string\n" if utf8::is_utf8 ($kani);
    # prints nothing
    $kani = chr (hex ($kani));
    print "chr makes it a character string\n" if utf8::is_utf8 ($kani);
    # prints "chr makes it a character string"


However, JSON::Parse also upgrades the remaining part of the string
into a character string, even when it's not marked as a character
string. For example,

    
    use JSON::Parse ':all';
    use Unicode::UTF8 'decode_utf8';
    no utf8;
    my $highbytes = "か";
    my $not_utf8 = "$highbytes\\u3042";
    my $test = "{\"a\":\"$not_utf8\"}";
    my $out = parse_json ($test);
    # JSON::Parse does something unusual here in promoting the first part
    # of the string into UTF-8.
    print "JSON::Parse gives this: ", $out->{a}, "\n";
    # Perl cannot assume that $highbytes is in UTF-8, so it has to just
    # turn the initial characters into garbage.
    my $add_chr = $highbytes . chr (0x3042);
    print "Perl's output is like this: ", $add_chr, "\n";
    # In fact JSON::Parse's behaviour is equivalent to this:
    my $equiv = decode_utf8 ($highbytes) . chr (0x3042);
    print "JSON::Parse did something like this: ", $equiv, "\n";
    # With character strings switched on, Perl and JSON::Parse do the same
    # thing.
    use utf8;
    my $is_utf8 = "か";
    my $test2 = "{\"a\":\"$is_utf8\\u3042\"}";
    my $out2 = parse_json ($test2);
    print "JSON::Parse: ", $out2->{a}, "\n";
    my $add_chr2 = $is_utf8 . chr (0x3042);
    print "Native Perl: ", $add_chr2, "\n";


produces output

    JSON::Parse gives this: かあ
    Perl's output is like this: ãあ
    JSON::Parse did something like this: かあ
    JSON::Parse: かあ
    Native Perl: かあ


(This example is included as L<F<unicode-details.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/unicode-details.pl> in the distribution.)


Although in general the above would be an unsafe practice, JSON::Parse
can do things this way because JSON is a text-only, Unicode-only
format. To ensure that invalid inputs are never upgraded, JSON::Parse
checks each input byte to make sure that it forms UTF-8. See also
L</UTF-8 only>. Doing things this way, rather than the way that Perl
does it, was one of the original motivations for writing this
module. See also L</HISTORY>.

Surrogate pairs in the form C<\uD834\uDD1E> are also handled. If the
second half of the surrogate pair is missing, an L</Unexpected
character> or L</Unexpected end of input> error is thrown. If the
second half of the surrogate pair is present but contains an
impossible value, a L</Not surrogate pair> error is thrown.

=head2 JSON arrays

JSON arrays become Perl array references. The elements of the Perl
array are in the same order as they appear in the JSON.

Thus

    my $p = parse_json ('["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday"]');

has the same result as a Perl declaration of the form

    my $p = [ 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday' ];

=head2 JSON objects

JSON objects become Perl hashes. The members of the JSON object become
key and value pairs in the Perl hash. The string part of each object
member becomes the key of the Perl hash. The value part of each member
is mapped to the value of the Perl hash.

Thus

    my $j = <<EOF;
    {"monday":["blue", "black"],
     "tuesday":["grey", "heart attack"],
     "friday":"Gotta get down on Friday"}
    EOF

    my $p = parse_json ($j);

has the same result as a Perl declaration of the form

    my $p = {
        monday => ['blue', 'black'],
        tuesday => ['grey', 'heart attack'],
        friday => 'Gotta get down on Friday',
    };

=head3 Key collisions

A key collision is something like the following.

    
    use JSON::Parse qw/parse_json parse_json_safe/;
    my $j = '{"a":1, "a":2}';
    my $p = parse_json ($j);
    print "Ambiguous key 'a' is ", $p->{a}, "\n";
    my $q = parse_json_safe ($j);


produces output

    JSON::Parse::parse_json_safe: JSON error at line 1, byte 10/14: Name is not unique: "a" parsing object starting from byte 1  at /usr/home/ben/projects/Json3/examples/key-collision.pl line 8.
    Ambiguous key 'a' is 2


(This example is included as L<F<key-collision.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/key-collision.pl> in the distribution.)


Here the key "a" could be either 1 or 2. As seen in the example,
L</parse_json> overwrites the first value with the second
value. L</parse_json_safe> halts and prints a warning. If you use
L</new> you can switch key collision on and off with the
L</detect_collisions> method.

The rationale for L</parse_json> not to give warnings is that Perl
doesn't give information about collisions when storing into hash
values, and checking for collisions for every key will degrade
performance for the sake of an unlikely occurrence. The JSON
specification says "The names within an object SHOULD be unique." (see
L</RFC 7159>, page 5), although it's not a requirement.

For performance, L</valid_json> and L</assert_valid_json> do not store
hash keys, thus they cannot detect this variety of problem.

=head2 Literals


=head3 null

L</parse_json> maps the JSON null literal to a readonly scalar
C<$JSON::Parse::null> which evaluates to C<undef>. L</parse_json_safe>
maps the JSON literal to the undefined value. If you use a parser
created with L</new>, you can choose either of these behaviours with
L</copy_literals>, or you can tell JSON::Parse to put your own value
in place of nulls using the L</set_null> method.

=head3 true

L</parse_json> maps the JSON true literal to a readonly scalar which
evaluates to C<1>. L</parse_json_safe> maps the JSON literal to the
value 1. If you use a parser created with L</new>, you can choose
either of these behaviours with L</copy_literals>, or you can tell
JSON::Parse to put your own value in place of trues using the
L</set_true> method.

=head3 false

L</parse_json> maps the JSON false literal to a readonly scalar which
evaluates to the empty string, or to zero in a numeric context. (This
behaviour changed from version 0.36 to 0.37. In versions up to 0.36,
the false literal was mapped to a readonly scalar which evaluated to 0
only.) L</parse_json_safe> maps the JSON literal to a similar scalar
without the readonly constraints. If you use a parser created with
L</new>, you can choose either of these behaviours with
L</copy_literals>, or you can tell JSON::Parse to put your own value
in place of falses using the L</set_false> method.

=head3 Round trips and compatibility

The Perl versions of literals produced by L</parse_json> will be
converted back to JSON literals if you use
L<JSON::Create/create_json>. However, JSON::Parse's literals are
incompatible with the other CPAN JSON modules. For compatibility with
other CPAN modules, create a JSON::Parse object with L</new>, and set
JSON::Parse's literals with L</set_true>, L</set_false>, and
L</set_null>.

This example demonstrates round-trip compatibility using L<JSON::Tiny>
version 0.54:

    
    use JSON::Tiny '0.54', qw(decode_json encode_json);
    use JSON::Parse;
    use JSON::Create;
    my $cream = '{"clapton":true,"hendrix":false,"bruce":true,"fripp":false}';
    my $jp = JSON::Parse->new ();
    my $jc = JSON::Create->new ();
    print "First do a round-trip of our modules:\n\n";
    print $jc->run ($jp->run ($cream)), "\n\n";
    print "Now do a round-trip of JSON::Tiny:\n\n";
    print encode_json (decode_json ($cream)), "\n\n";
    print "First, incompatible mode:\n\n";
    print 'tiny(parse): ', encode_json ($jp->run ($cream)), "\n";
    print 'create(tiny): ', $jc->run (decode_json ($cream)), "\n\n";
    $jp->set_true (JSON::Tiny::true);
    $jp->set_false (JSON::Tiny::false);
    print "Compatibility with JSON::Parse:\n\n";
    print 'tiny(parse):', encode_json ($jp->run ($cream)), "\n\n";
    $jc->bool ('JSON::Tiny::_Bool');
    print "Compatibility with JSON::Create:\n\n";
    print 'create(tiny):', $jc->run (decode_json ($cream)), "\n\n";
    print "JSON::Parse and JSON::Create are still compatible too:\n\n";
    print $jc->run ($jp->run ($cream)), "\n";


produces output

    First do a round-trip of our modules:
    
    {"hendrix":false,"clapton":true,"fripp":false,"bruce":true}
    
    Now do a round-trip of JSON::Tiny:
    
    {"bruce":true,"clapton":true,"fripp":false,"hendrix":false}
    
    First, incompatible mode:
    
    tiny(parse): {"bruce":1,"clapton":1,"fripp":"","hendrix":""}
    create(tiny): {"fripp":0,"bruce":1,"clapton":1,"hendrix":0}
    
    Compatibility with JSON::Parse:
    
    tiny(parse):{"bruce":true,"clapton":true,"fripp":false,"hendrix":false}
    
    Compatibility with JSON::Create:
    
    create(tiny):{"hendrix":false,"fripp":false,"bruce":true,"clapton":true}
    
    JSON::Parse and JSON::Create are still compatible too:
    
    {"fripp":false,"bruce":true,"clapton":true,"hendrix":false}


(This example is included as L<F<json-tiny-round-trip-demo.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/json-tiny-round-trip-demo.pl> in the distribution.)


Most of the other CPAN modules use similar methods to L<JSON::Tiny>,
so the above example can easily be adapted. See also
L<JSON::Create/Interoperability> for various examples.

=head3 Modifying the values

L</parse_json> maps all the literals to read-only values. Because of
this, attempting to modifying the boolean values in the hash reference
returned by L</parse_json> will cause "Modification of a read-only
value attempted" errors:

    my $in = '{"hocus":true,"pocus":false,"focus":null}';
    my $p = json_parse ($in);
    $p->{hocus} = 99;
    # "Modification of a read-only value attempted" error occurs

Since the hash values are read-only scalars, 
C<< $p->{hocus} = 99 >> is like this:

    undef = 99;

If you need to modify the returned hash reference, then delete the
value first:

    my $in = '{"hocus":true,"pocus":false,"focus":null}';
    my $p = json_parse ($in);
    delete $p->{pocus};
    $p->{pocus} = 99;
    # OK

Similarly with array references, delete the value before altering:

    my $in = '[true,false,null]';
    my $q = json_parse ($in);
    delete $q->[1];
    $q->[1] = 'magic';

Note that the return values from parsing bare literals are not
read-only scalars, so

    my $true = JSON::Parse::json_parse ('true');
    $true = 99;

produces no error. This is because Perl copies the scalar.

=head1 METHODS

If you need to parse JSON and you are not satisfied with the parsing
options offered by L</parse_json> and L</parse_json_safe>, you can
create a JSON parsing object with L</new> and set various options on
the object, then use it with L</run>. These options include the
ability to copy JSON literals with L</copy_literals>, switch off fatal
errors with L</warn_only>, detect key collisions in objects with
L</detect_collisions>, and set the JSON literals to user defined
values with the methods described under L</Methods for manipulating
literals>.

These methods only work on an object created with L</new>; they do not
affect the behaviour of L</parse_json> or L</parse_json_safe>.

=head2 new

    my $jp = JSON::Parse->new ();

Create a new JSON::Parse object.

This method was added in version 0.38.

=head2 run

    my $out = $jp->run ($json);

This does the same thing as L</parse_json>, except its behaviour can
be modified using the methods below.

This method was added in version 0.38.

=head2 check

    eval {
        $jp->check ($json);
    };

This does the same thing as L</assert_valid_json>, except its
behaviour can be modified using the methods below. Only the
L</diagnostics_hash> method will actually affect this.

This method was added in version 0.48, for the benefit of
L<JSON::Repair>.

=head2 copy_literals

    $jp->copy_literals (1);

With a true value, copy JSON literal values (C<null>, C<true>, and
C<false>) into new Perl scalar values, and don't put read-only values
into the output. 

With a false value, use read-only scalars:

    $jp->copy_literals (0);

The C<copy_literals (1)> behaviour is the behaviour of
L</parse_json_safe>. The C<copy_literals (0)> behaviour is the
behaviour of L</parse_json>.

If the user also sets user-defined literals with L</set_true>,
L</set_false> and L</set_null>, that takes precedence over this.

This method was added in version 0.38.

=head2 warn_only

    $jp->warn_only (1);

Warn, don't die, on error. Failed parsing returns the undefined value,
C<undef>, and prints a warning.

This can be switched off again using any false value:

    $jp->warn_only ('');

This method was documented in version 0.38, but only implemented in
version 0.41.

=head2 detect_collisions

    $jp->detect_collisions (1);

This switches on a check for hash key collisions (non-unique names in
JSON objects). If a collision is found, an error message L</Name is
not unique> is printed, which also gives the non-unique name and the
byte position where the start of the colliding string was found:

    
    use JSON::Parse;
    my $jp = JSON::Parse->new ();
    $jp->detect_collisions (1);
    eval {
        $jp->run ('{"animals":{"cat":"moggy","cat":"feline","cat":"neko"}}');
    };
    print "$@\n" if $@;


produces output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 28/55: Name is not unique: "cat" parsing object starting from byte 12 at /usr/home/ben/projects/Json3/blib/lib/JSON/Parse.pm line 103.
    


(This example is included as L<F<collide.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/JSON-Parse-0.57/examples/collide.pl> in the distribution.)


The C<detect_collisions (1)> behaviour is the behaviour of
L</parse_json_safe>. The C<detect_collisions (0)> behaviour is the
behaviour of L</parse_json>.

This method was added in version 0.38.

=head2 diagnostics_hash

    $jp->diagnostics_hash (1);

This changes diagnostics produced by errors from a simple string into
a hash reference containing various fields. This is experimental and
subject to change. This is incompatible with L</warn_only>.

This replaces the previous experimental global variable
C<$json_diagnostics>, which was removed from the module. The hash keys
and values are identical to those provided in the object returned by
C<$json_diagnostics>, with the addition of a key C<error as string>
which returns the usual error.

This requires Perl version 5.14 or later.

This method was added in version 0.46.

=head2 Methods for manipulating literals

These methods alter what is written into the Perl structure when the
parser sees a literal value, C<true>, C<false> or C<null> in the input
JSON.

This number of methods is unfortunately necessary, since it's possible
that a user might want to set_false (undef) to set false values to
turn into undefs.

    $jp->set_false (undef);

Thus, we cannot use a single function C<< $jp->false (undef) >> to
cover both setting and deleting of values.

These methods were added in version 0.38.





=head3 set_true

    $jp->set_true ("Yes, that is so true");

Supply a scalar to be used in place of the JSON C<true> literal. 

This example puts the string "Yes, that is so true" into the hash or
array when we hit a "true" literal, rather than the default read-only
scalar:

    
    use JSON::Parse;
    my $json = '{"yes":true,"no":false}';
    my $jp = JSON::Parse->new ();
    $jp->set_true ('Yes, that is so true');
    my $out = $jp->run ($json);
    print $out->{yes}, "\n";
    


prints

    Yes, that is so true



To override the previous value, call it again with a new value. To
delete the value and revert to the default behaviour, use
L</delete_true>.



If you give this a value which is not "true", as in Perl will
evaluate it as a false in an if statement, it prints a warning
L</User-defined value for JSON true evaluates as false>.
You can switch this warning off with L</no_warn_literals>.



This method was added in version 0.38.

=head3 delete_true

    $jp->delete_true ();

Delete the user-defined true value. See L</set_true>. 

This method is "safe" in that it has absolutely no effect if no
user-defined value is in place. It does not return a value.

This method was added in version 0.38.




=head3 set_false

    $jp->set_false (JSON::PP::Boolean::false);

Supply a scalar to be used in place of the JSON C<false> literal. 

In the above example, when we hit a "false" literal, we put
C<JSON::PP::Boolean::false> in the output, similar to L<JSON::PP> and
other CPAN modules like L<Mojo::JSON> or L<JSON::XS>.


To override the previous value, call it again with a new value. To
delete the value and revert to the default behaviour, use
L</delete_false>.



If you give this a value which is not "false", as in Perl will
evaluate it as a false in an if statement, it prints a warning
L</User-defined value for JSON false evaluates as true>.
You can switch this warning off with L</no_warn_literals>.



This method was added in version 0.38.

=head3 delete_false

    $jp->delete_false ();

Delete the user-defined false value. See L</set_false>. 

This method is "safe" in that it has absolutely no effect if no
user-defined value is in place. It does not return a value.

This method was added in version 0.38.




=head3 set_null

    $jp->set_null (0);

Supply a scalar to be used in place of the JSON C<null> literal. 


To override the previous value, call it again with a new value. To
delete the value and revert to the default behaviour, use
L</delete_null>.



This method was added in version 0.38.

=head3 delete_null

    $jp->delete_null ();

Delete the user-defined null value. See L</set_null>. 

This method is "safe" in that it has absolutely no effect if no
user-defined value is in place. It does not return a value.

This method was added in version 0.38.



=head3 no_warn_literals

    $jp->no_warn_literals (1);

Use a true value to switch off warnings about setting boolean values
to contradictory things. For example if you want to set the JSON
C<false> literal to turn into the string "false",

    $jp->no_warn_literals (1);
    $jp->set_false ("false");

See also L</Contradictory values for "true" and "false">.

This also switches off the warning L</User-defined value overrules
copy_literals>.

This method was added in version 0.38.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

This module imposes the following restrictions on its input.

=over

=item JSON only

JSON::Parse is a strict parser. It only accepts input which exactly
meets the criteria of L</RFC 7159>. That means, for example,
JSON::Parse does not accept single quotes (') instead of double quotes
("), or numbers with leading zeros, like 0123. JSON::Parse does not
accept control characters (0x00 - 0x1F) in strings, missing commas
between array or hash elements like C<["a" "b"]>, or trailing commas
like C<["a","b","c",]>. It also does not accept trailing
non-whitespace, like the second "]" in C<["a"]]>.

=item No incremental parsing

JSON::Parse does not parse incrementally. It only parses fully-formed
JSON strings which include all opening and closing brackets. This is
an inherent part of the design of the module. Incremental parsing in
the style of L<XML::Parser> would (obviously) require some kind of
callback structure to deal with the elements of the partially digested
structures, but JSON::Parse was never designed to do this; it merely
converts what it sees into a Perl structure. Claims to offer
incremental JSON parsing in other modules' documentation should be
diligently verified.

=item UTF-8 only

Although JSON may come in various encodings of Unicode, JSON::Parse
only parses the UTF-8 format. If input is in a different Unicode
encoding than UTF-8, convert the input before handing it to this
module. For example, for the UTF-16 format,

    use Encode 'decode';
    my $input_utf8 = decode ('UTF-16', $input);
    my $perl = parse_json ($input_utf8);

or, for a file, use C<:encoding> (see L<PerlIO::encoding> and
L<perluniintro>):

    open my $input, "<:encoding(UTF-16)", 'some-json-file'; 

JSON::Parse does not determine the nature of the octet stream, as
described in part 3 of L</RFC 7159>.

This restriction to UTF-8 applies regardless of whether Perl thinks
that the input string is a character string or a byte
string. Non-UTF-8 input will cause an L</Unexpected character> error.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

L</valid_json> does not produce error messages. L</parse_json> and
L</assert_valid_json> die on encountering invalid
input. L</parse_json_safe> uses L<Carp/carp> to pass error messages as
warnings.

Error messages have the line number, and the byte number where
appropriate, of the input which caused the problem. The line number is
formed simply by counting the number of "\n" (linefeed, ASCII 0x0A)
characters in the whitespace part of the JSON.

In L</parse_json> and L</assert_valid_json>, parsing errors are fatal,
so to continue after an error occurs, put the parsing into an C<eval>
block:

    my $p;                       
    eval {                       
        $p = parse_json ($j);  
    };                           
    if ($@) {                    
        # handle error           
    }

The following error messages are produced:



=head2 Unexpected character

An unexpected character (byte) was encountered in the input. For
example, when looking at the beginning of a string supposedly
containing JSON, if the module encounters a plus sign, it will give an
error like this:

    assert_valid_json ('+');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 1/1: Unexpected character '+' parsing initial state: expecting whitespace: 'n', '\r', '\t', ' ' or start of string: '"' or digit: '0-9' or minus: '-' or start of an array or object: '{', '[' or start of literal: 't', 'f', 'n' 



The message always includes a list of what characters are allowed.

If there is some recognizable structure being parsed, the error
message will include its starting point in the form "starting from
byte n":

    assert_valid_json ('{"this":"\a"}');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 11/13: Unexpected character 'a' parsing string starting from byte 9: expecting escape: '', '/', '"', 'b', 'f', 'n', 'r', 't', 'u' 



A feature of JSON is that parsing it requires only one byte to be
examined at a time. Thus almost all parsing problems can be handled
using the "Unexpected character" error type, including spelling errors
in literals:

    assert_valid_json ('[true,folse]');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 8/12: Unexpected character 'o' parsing literal starting from byte 7: expecting 'a' 



and the missing second half of a surrogate pair:

    assert_valid_json ('["\udc00? <-- should be a second half here"]');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 9/44: Unexpected character '?' parsing unicode escape starting from byte 3: expecting '\' 



All kinds of errors can occur parsing numbers, for example a missing
fraction,

    assert_valid_json ('[1.e9]');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 4/6: Unexpected character 'e' parsing number starting from byte 2: expecting digit: '0-9' 



and a leading zero,

    assert_valid_json ('[0123]');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 3/6: Unexpected character '1' parsing number starting from byte 2: expecting whitespace: 'n', '\r', '\t', ' ' or comma: ',' or end of array: ']' or dot: '.' or exponential sign: 'e', 'E' 



The error message is this complicated because all of the following are
valid here: whitespace: C<[0 ]>; comma: C<[0,1]>, end of array:
C<[0]>, dot: C<[0.1]>, or exponential: C<[0e0]>.

These are all handled by this error.  Thus the error messages are a
little confusing as diagnostics.

Versions of this module prior to 0.29 gave more informative messages
like "leading zero in number". (The messages weren't documented.) The
reason to change over to the single message was because it makes the
parsing code simpler, and because the testing code described in
L</TESTING> makes use of the internals of this error to check that the
error message produced actually do correspond to the invalid and valid
bytes allowed by the parser, at the exact byte given.

This is a bytewise error, thus for example if a miscoded UTF-8 appears
in the input, an error message saying what bytes would be valid at
that point will be printed.

    
    no utf8;
    use JSON::Parse 'assert_valid_json';
    
    # Error in first byte:
    
    my $bad_utf8_1 = chr (hex ("81"));
    eval { assert_valid_json ("[\"$bad_utf8_1\"]"); };
    print "$@\n";
    
    # Error in third byte:
    
    my $bad_utf8_2 = chr (hex ('e2')) . chr (hex ('9C')) . 'b';
    eval { assert_valid_json ("[\"$bad_utf8_2\"]"); };
    print "$@\n";


prints

    JSON error at line 1, byte 3/5: Unexpected character 0x81 parsing string starting from byte 2: expecting printable ASCII or first byte of UTF-8: '\x20-\x7f', '\xC2-\xF4' at examples/bad-utf8.pl line 10.
    
    JSON error at line 1, byte 5/7: Unexpected character 'b' parsing string starting from byte 2: expecting bytes in range 80-bf: '\x80-\xbf' at examples/bad-utf8.pl line 16.
    





=head2 Unexpected end of input

The end of the string was encountered before the end of whatever was
being parsed was. For example, if a quote is missing from the end of
the string, it will give an error like this:

    assert_valid_json ('{"first":"Suzuki","second":"Murakami","third":"Asada}');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1: Unexpected end of input parsing string starting from byte 47 






=head2 Not surrogate pair

While parsing a string, a surrogate pair was encountered. While trying
to turn this into UTF-8, the second half of the surrogate pair turned
out to be an invalid value.

    assert_valid_json ('["\uDC00\uABCD"]');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1: Not surrogate pair parsing unicode escape starting from byte 11 






=head2 Empty input

This error occurs for an input which is an empty (no length or
whitespace only) or an undefined value.

    assert_valid_json ('');


gives output

    JSON error: Empty input parsing initial state 



Prior to version 0.49, this error was produced by
L</assert_valid_json> only, but it is now also produced by
L</parse_json>. See L</JSON Parsing Test Suite>.




=head2 Name is not unique

This error occurs when parsing JSON when the user has chosen
L</detect_collisions>. For example an input like

    my $p = JSON::Parse->new ();
    $p->detect_collisions (1);
    $p->run ('{"hocus":1,"pocus":2,"hocus":3}');


gives output

    JSON error at line 1, byte 23/31: Name is not unique: "hocus" parsing object starting from byte 1 at blib/lib/JSON/Parse.pm line 109.



where the JSON object has two keys with the same name, C<hocus>. The
terminology "name is not unique" is from the JSON specification.




=head2 Contradictory values for "true" and "false"

=head3 User-defined value for JSON false evaluates as true

This happens if you set JSON false to map to a true value:

    $jp->set_false (1);

To switch off this warning, use L</no_warn_literals>.

This warning was added in version 0.38.

=head3 User-defined value for JSON true evaluates as false

This happens if you set JSON true to map to a false value:

    $jp->set_true (undef);

To switch off this warning, use L</no_warn_literals>.

This warning was added in version 0.38.

=head2 User-defined value overrules copy_literals

This warning is given if you set up literals with L</copy_literals>
then you also set up your own true, false, or null values with
L</set_true>, L</set_false>, or L</set_null>.

This warning was added in version 0.38.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

On the author's computer, the module's speed of parsing is
approximately the same as L<JSON::XS>, with small variations depending
on the type of input. For validation, L</valid_json> is faster than
any other module known to the author, and up to ten times faster than
JSON::XS.

Some special types of input, such as floating point numbers containing
an exponential part, like "1e09", seem to be about two or three times
faster to parse with this module than with L<JSON::XS>. In
JSON::Parse, parsing of exponentials is done by the system's C<strtod>
function, but JSON::XS contains its own parser for exponentials, so
these results may be system-dependent. 

At the moment the main place JSON::XS wins over JSON::Parse is in
strings containing escape characters, where JSON::XS is about 10%
faster on the module author's computer and compiler. As of version
0.33, despite some progress in improving JSON::Parse, I haven't been
able to fully work out the reason behind the better speed.

There is some benchmarking code in the github repository under the
directory "benchmarks" for those wishing to test these claims. The
script L<F<benchmarks/bench>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/benchmarks/bench> is an adaptation of the similar
script in the L<JSON::XS> distribution. The script L<F<benchmarks/pub-bench.pl>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/benchmarks/pub-bench.pl> runs the benchmarks and prints them
out as POD.

The following benchmark tests used version 0.47 of JSON::Parse and
version 3.03 of JSON::XS on Perl Version 18.2, compiled with Clang
version 3.4.1 on FreeBSD 10.3. The files in the "benchmarks" directory
of JSON::Parse. "short.json" and "long.json" are the benchmarks used
by JSON::XS.

=head1 TESTING

=head2 Internal testing code

The module incorporates extensive testing related to the production of
error messages and validation of input. Some of the testing code is
supplied with the module in the F</t/> subdirectory of the
distribution.

More extensive testing code is in the git repository. This is not
supplied in the CPAN distribution. A script, L<F<randomjson.pl>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/randomjson.pl>,
generates a set number of bytes of random JSON and checks that the
module's bytewise validation of input is correct. It does this by
taking a valid fragment, then adding each possible byte from 0 to 255
to see whether the module correctly identifies it as valid or invalid
at that point, then randomly picking one of the valid bytes and adding
it to the fragment and continuing the process until a complete valid
JSON input is formed. The module has undergone about a billion
repetitions of this test.

This setup relies on a C file, L<F<json-random-test.c>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/json-random-test.c>, which isn't in
the CPAN distribution, and it also requires L<F<Json3.xs>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/Json3.xs> to be edited
to make the macro C<TESTRANDOM> true (uncomment line 7 of the
file). The testing code uses C setjmp/longjmp, so it's not guaranteed
to work on all operating systems and is commented out for CPAN
releases.

A pure C version called L<F<random-test.c>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/random-test.c> also exists. This applies
exactly the same tests, and requires no Perl at all.

If you're interested in testing your own JSON parser, the outputs
generated by L<F<randomjson.pl>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/randomjson.pl> are quite a good place to start. The
default is to produce UTF-8 output, which looks pretty horrible since
it tends to produce long strings of UTF-8 garbage. (This is because it
chooses randomly from 256 bytes and the end-of-string marker C<"> has
only a 1/256 chance of being chosen, so the strings tend to get long
and messy). You can mess with the internals of JSON::Parse by setting
MAXBYTE in F<json-common.c> to 0x80, recompiling (you can ignore the
compiler warnings), and running F<randomjson.pl> again to get just
ASCII random JSON things. This breaks the UTF-8 functionality of
JSON::Parse, so please don't install that version.

=head2 JSON Parsing Test Suite

Version 0.48 passed all but two of the yes/no tests of the L<JSON
Parsing Test Suite|https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite>. The first
failure was that L</assert_valid_json> did not mark L<a completely
empty
file|https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/blob/master/test_parsing/n_structure_no_data.json>
as invalid JSON, and the second was that L</parse_json> did not mark
L<a file containing a single space
character|https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite/blob/master/test_parsing/n_single_space.json>
as invalid json. The tests also revealed an inconsistency between
L</assert_valid_json> and L</valid_json>, which was reporting the
completely empty file as invalid. Running these tests also revealed
several bugs in the script L<validjson|/SCRIPT>. All of these errors
were amended in version 0.49.

I attempted to include the JSON Parsing Test Suite tests in the
module's tests, but some of the files (like 100,000 open arrays)
actually L<cause crashes on some versions of Perl on some
machines|http://fast-matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=JSON-Parse%200.48_01>,
so they're not really suitable for distribution. The tests are found,
however, in the repository under L<F<xt/jpts.t>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/xt/jpts.t> and the
subdirectory L<F<xt/jpts>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/xt/jpts>, so if you are interested in the
results, please copy that and try it. There is also a test for the
L<validjson|/SCRIPT> script as L<F<xt/validjson.t>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/xt/validjson.t> in the
repository. These are author tests, so you may need to install extra
modules to run them. These author tests are run automatically before
any code is uploaded to CPAN.

=head1 HISTORY

See L<F<Changes>|https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-Parse/blob/42e099ed38a3e85daed46f53bf367fa2b828e152/Changes> in the distribution for a full list of changes.

This module started out under the name C<JSON::Argo>. It was
originally a way to escape from having to use the other JSON modules
on CPAN. The biggest issue that I had with the other modules was the
way that Unicode was handled. Insisting on the pure Perl method of
dealing with JSON strings, which are required to be in Unicode anyway,
seems to me little more than superstition, something like telling
programmers not to step on cracks in the pavement. This module
completely bypasses that. See L</Handling of Unicode> for the details
of how this module differs from the other modules.

The reason it only parsed JSON was that when I started this I didn't
know the Perl extension language XS very well (I still don't know it
very well), and I was not confident about making a JSON producer, so
it only parsed JSON, which was the main job I needed to do. It
originally used lex and yacc in the form of flex and bison, since
discarded. I also found out that someone else had a JSON parser called
Argo in Java, so to save confusion I dropped the name JSON::Argo and
renamed this JSON::Parse, keeping the version numbers continuous.

The module has since been completely rewritten, twice, mostly in an
attempt to improve performance, after I found that JSON::XS was much
faster than the original JSON::Parse. (The first rewrite of the module
was not released to CPAN, this is the second one, which explains why
some files have names like F<Json3.xs>). I also hoped to make something
useful which wasn't in any existing CPAN module by offering the
high-speed validator, L</valid_json>.

I also rewrote the module due to some bugs I found, for example up to
version 0.09 it was failing to accept whitespace after an object key
string, so a JSON input of the form C<{ "x" : "y" }>, with whitespace
between the C<"x"> and the colon, C<:>, would cause it to fail. That
was one big reason I created the random testing regime described in
L</TESTING> above. I believe that the module is now compliant with the
JSON specification. 

After starting JSON::Create, I realised that some edge case handling
in JSON::Parse needed to be improved. This resulted in the addition of
the hash collision and literal-overriding methods introduced
in versions 0.37 and 0.38 of this module.

Version 0.42 fixed a very serious bug where long strings could
overflow an internal buffer, and could cause a segmentation fault.

Version 0.48 removed an experimental feature called
C<$json_diagnostics> which made the module's errors be produced in
JSON format, and replaced it with the current L</diagnostics_hash>
method, for the benefit of L</JSON::Repair>.

Version 0.49 brought the module into conformance with the L</JSON
Parsing Test Suite>.

Version 0.54 removed support for the Solaris operating system.
