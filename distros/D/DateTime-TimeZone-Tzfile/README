NAME

DateTime::TimeZone::Tzfile - tzfile (zoneinfo) timezone files

DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class represents a timezone that was encoded in a
file in the tzfile(5) format.  These can express arbitrary patterns of
offsets from Universal Time, changing over time.  Offsets and change
times are limited to a resolution of one second.

This class implements the DateTime::TimeZone interface, so that its
instances can be used with DateTime objects.
