READ THIS
    If you don't want to go through the trouble explained below and
    want to build this extension from a freeWAIS-sf source
    directory, get the latest `Wais-2.2??' version!

    If you have a perl <= 5.003_07, get the latest `Wais-2.1??'
    version!

Requirements
  wais.h

    To compile this modules needs to find `wais.h' in it's include
    path. If you don't have one already, chdir to your freeWAIS-sf
    source directory in the `ir' and call the mkinc script in this
    distribution like this:

            perl .../mkinc -I../ctype ui.h cutil.h irext.h irfiles.h \
                 irsearch.h irtfiles.h weight.h docid.h > wais.h

    The `...' must be replaced by the path to this directory. Then
    move `wais.h' to a place where your C-compiler can find it.

    You may add additional directories to search in the
    `Makefile.PL' to the `INC' parameter of the `WriteMakefile()'
    call.

  libwais.a

    You need also a `libwais.a' which contains all necessary object
    files. If you use a older freeWAIS-sf distribution, it might
    have generated different libraries, namely `ir/libwais.a',
    `lib/libftw.a', `regexp/libregexp.a'. Also the file
    `ctype/ctype.o' might be not in any of them. In this case you
    must merge the libraries by hand:

            mkdir /tmp/wais
            cd /tmp/wais
            ar x .../ir/libwais.a
            ar x .../regexp/libregexp.a
            ar x .../lib/libftw.a
            cp .../ctype/ctype.o .
            ar rc libwais.a *.o
            ranlib libwais.a 

    Depending an your system, the `ar' flags might differ or the
    `ranlib' may be obsolete. Please consult the ar manpage and the
    ranlib manpage. In addition you may examine the output of perl -
    V:ar -V:ranlib

    Move the new `libwais.a' to a place where your linker will find
    it or add appropriate linker flags to the `LIBS' parameter of
    the `WriteMakefile()' call.

  waisindex, waisserver

    To perform the regression tests, the Module will need
    `waisindex' to create a test database and waisserver to test
    *remote* connections.

    If you do not have a working `waisserver', failure report will
    approximately look like this:

      t/a_preop.t                   3    1  33.33%  3    <- server start failed
      t/basic.t                     4    2  50.00%  3-4  <- 'remote' searches
      t/parallel.t                  6    4  66.67%  3-6  <- 'remote' searches
      t/z_postop.t                  2    1  50.00%  1    <- server stop

Building this extension
    Make sure that you met the requirements above. If your perl
    supports dynamic loading, do:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install
            make clean

    If you want to build a perl with this extension statically
    linked in do:

            make Makefile.PL
            make waisperl
            make test_static

    To install the new "waisperl" binary, call

        make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=waisperl

    To remove the intermediate files say

        make -f Makefile.aperl map_clean

    If something goes wrong during `make test', try

        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

    or

        make test_static TEST_VERBOSE=1
