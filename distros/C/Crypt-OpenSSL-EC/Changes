Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::OpenSSL::EC.

1.01  2015-01-29
      Added some more tests.
      Fixed crashes associated with get0_private_key and get0_group.

0.9   2015-01-29
      Fixed a problem where EC_KEY_get0_public_key did not duplicate the
      returned EC_POINT, potentially causing a double free of the point and
      subsequent crash. Reported by Dick Franks.

0.8   2015-01-28
      Omitted Changes for 0.7

0.7   2015-01-28
      Fixed problem where BIGNUMs were not blessed

0.6   2015-01-07
      Fixed a problem due to the fact that EC_GROUP_get0_generator returned a
      pointer to an internal object with a EC_GROUP. The point is now
      duplicated. Reported by Dick Franks.

0.5   2013-08-23

      EC_GROUP_get_curve_GF2m()
      EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m()
      EC_GROUP_get_trinomial_basis()
      EC_GROUP_get_pentanomial_basis()
      EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GF2m()
