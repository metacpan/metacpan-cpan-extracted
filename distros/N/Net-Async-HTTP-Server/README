NAME

    Net::Async::HTTP::Server - serve HTTP with IO::Async

SYNOPSIS

       use Net::Async::HTTP::Server;
       use IO::Async::Loop;
    
       use HTTP::Response;
    
       my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new();
    
       my $httpserver = Net::Async::HTTP::Server->new(
          on_request => sub {
             my $self = shift;
             my ( $req ) = @_;
    
             my $response = HTTP::Response->new( 200 );
             $response->add_content( "Hello, world!\n" );
             $response->content_type( "text/plain" );
             $response->content_length( length $response->content );
    
             $req->respond( $response );
          },
       );
    
       $loop->add( $httpserver );
    
       $httpserver->listen(
          addr => { family => "inet6", socktype => "stream", port => 8080 },
       )->get
    
       $loop->run;

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows a program to respond asynchronously to HTTP
    requests, as part of a program based on IO::Async. An object in this
    class listens on a single port and invokes the on_request callback or
    subclass method whenever an HTTP request is received, allowing the
    program to respond to it.

    For accepting HTTP connections via PSGI and Plack, see also
    Plack::Handler::Net::Async::HTTP::Server.

 Metrics

    Since version 0.11.

    This module reports basic metrics about received requests and sent
    responses via Metrics::Any.

EVENTS

 on_request $req

    Invoked when a new HTTP request is received. It will be passed a
    Net::Async::HTTP::Server::Request object.

PARAMETERS

    The following named parameters may be passed to new or configure:

 request_class => STRING

    Gives the name of the class that make_request will construct. This is
    provided as an alternative to overriding the make_request method, for
    the case where no other methods need overriding or other behaviour
    changed.

METHODS

    As a small subclass of IO::Async::Listener, this class does not provide
    many new methods of its own. The superclass provides useful methods to
    control the basic operation of this server.

    Specifically, see the "listen" in IO::Async::Listener method on how to
    actually bind the server to a listening socket to make it accept
    requests.

 make_request

       $request = $server->make_request( @args );

    Invoked by the protocol stream handler to create a new request object
    representing an incoming request. This is provided as a method for
    subclasses to overload, if they wish to represent requests with
    subclasses of the basic request representation.

TODO

      * Don't use HTTP::Message objects as underlying implementation

      * Consider how to do streaming request inbound

      * Lots more testing
