NAME
    Const::Dual - numeric constants that know their names

SYNOPSIS
        # create constants
        use Const::Dual (
            TYPE_FOO => 1,
            TYPE_BAR => 2,
            # ... more constants ...
            TYPE_BAZ => 99,
        );

        $type = TYPE_BAR;
        print $type + 0;                               # 2
        print $type == 2 ? "bar" : "not bar";          # bar
        print $type == TYPE_BAR ? "bar" : "not bar";   # bar
        print "type = $type";                          # type = TYPE_BAR

        # create constants and store them in %TYPES
        use Const::Dual \%TYPES => (
            TYPE_FOO => 1,
            TYPE_BAR => 2,
            # ... more constants ...
            TYPE_BAZ => 99,
        );
        @EXPORT_OK = keys %TYPES;
        @EXPORT_TAGS = (types => [ keys %TYPES ]);

        # get dual value from non-dual value
        my $type = $ARGV[0] // 99;
        my %TYPES_REVERSE; @TYPES_REVERSE{ map { int $_ } values %TYPES } = values %TYPES;
        die "Invalid type $type" unless exists $TYPES_REVERSE{$type};
        $type = $TYPES_REVERSE{$type};
        print int $type;                               # 99
        print "type = $type";                          # type = TYPE_BAZ

        # dual constants are always true!
        use Const::Dual FALSE => 0;
        print int FALSE;                               # 0
        print "FALSE is ", FALSE ? "true" : "false";   # FALSE is true

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be helpful when you use a lot of constants and really
    tired to deal with them. Numeric constants created with this module are
    dual (see "dualvar" in Scalar::Util). They have their given numeric
    values when are used in numeric context. When used in string context,
    such constants are strings with constants' names. This can be useful for
    debug purposes: constant's value "knows" constant's name and it can be
    printed. This behavior does not apply to non-numberic constants, they
    are created as usual.

CAVEATS
    Developer should ALWAYS keep in mind that he works with dual values and
    should force numeric context when necessary. This is strict rule and
    it's violation can lead to bugs. Common ways to force numeric context is
    "int $value" or "$value+0".

    Dual constant in bool context is always TRUE, because one of constant's
    value is it's name and it can not be FALSE.
