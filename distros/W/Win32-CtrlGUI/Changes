  - Rewrite of DebugTk.pm to use Text widgets instead of Label widgets for
    displaying information in the HList
  - Rewrite of DebugTk to us tagged_stringify so that stringified states

  - Added code to Win32::CtrlGUI::Window to verify that the window
    still exists before doing things (like sending keystrokes).

  - Tk debugger for Win32::CtrlGUI::State written.  The killer app for
    Win32::CtrlGUI::State now exists.  It still needs some work, but it's
    functional enough to be of use.
