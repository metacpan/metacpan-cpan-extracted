These patches find bugs or enhance the functionality of the
Net::FTPServer package. Some or all of them might be included
eventually in newer versions of Net::FTPServer.

* DirHandle-rmdir-bug.patch

This patch fixes a bug in some rmdir() calls, that choke with dirs
ending in '/'. This has been observed in Mac OS X 10.1.5 but might be
present in other OSes. This patch can be applied to
lib/Net/FTPServer/Full/DirHandle.pm in the distribution for
Net::FTPServer-1.111. It is expected that later versions include the
patch.

* FTPServer-chdir-rule.patch

This patch adds a "chdir rule" to the config. This rule is invoked
before CWD and CDUP, allowing finer control upon where a user is
allowed to wander without resorting to permissions.
