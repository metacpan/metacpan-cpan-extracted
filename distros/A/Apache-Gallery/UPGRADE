For users upgrading to 1.0

If you are using mod_perl2 version mod_perl-2.0 is now required.

Also, CGI 3.08 is required if using mod_perl2.

To enable access keys for navigation update the navpicture.tpl and
showpicture.tpl templates.

For users upgrading from 0.7 to 0.8

You need to create new directory called gallery in Apaches
icons directory. Copy the png files from the htdocs dictory
to this new directory.

For those of you with pre-existing templates, a simple

   cd templates; perl -pi -e 's/(?<!\\)(\$[\w\_\d]+)/\{ $1 \}/g' *.tpl

should get your templates but directory.tpl and file.tpl
working correctly. The last two needs to be updated from
the distribution.

For users upgrading from 0.6 to 0.7

Apache::Gallery now uses the module Image::Imlib2 instead
of Inline::C. This enables us to ship binary distributions.

Copy htdocs/agfolder.png to your Apache
icons directory.

If you enable the GalleryMaxThumbnailsPerPage option you
need to update your index.tpl template file or use the
new templates. You also need to copy templates/default/gallery.css
to your DocumentRoot.

To update to the new layout, copy templates/new/gallery.css 
to your DocumentRoot and copy templates/new/*.tpl to your
GalleryTemplateDir and set the following option in your virtual
host:

PerlSetVar GalleryEXIFMode 'values'

For users upgrading from 0.5.1 to 0.6

templates/movie.tpl has been removed and replaced by
templates/file.tpl

Remember to update templates/picture.tpl

htdocs/video-wmv.png
htdocs/application-doc.png
htdocs/application-mp3.png
htdocs/application-ogg.png
htdocs/application-pdf.png
htdocs/application-rtf.png
htdocs/application-wav.png

have been added and should be copied to our Apache icons
directory.

For users upgrading from 0.5 to 0.5.1

InlineDir is no longer honored, File::Spec is used to find a temporary
directory (usually /tmp)
Since 0.5, your .cache subdirectories are no longer used and can be
safely deleted. All cached images are now kept in
/var/tmp/Apache-Gallery/ unless you set GalleryCacheDir.

For users upgrading from 0.4 to 0.5

Remember to update the following templates:
templates/interval.tpl
templates/intervalactive.tpl
templates/layout.tpl
templates/refresh.tpl
templates/scaleactive.tpl
templates/showpicture.tpl
templates/slideshowisoff.tpl
templates/slideshowoff.tpl
templates/pictureinfo.tpl
templates/nopictureinfo.tpl

A new option has been added:

PerlSetVar	GalleryCacheDir '/var/tmp/Apache-Gallery/'

GalleryCacheDir is optional but you can use it to decide
where Apache::Gallery should place the scaled pictures.

For users upgrading from 0.3 to 0.4:

Two new options have been added, they are both optional:

PerlSetVar   GalleryThumbnailSize '100x75'
PerlSetVar   GalleryCopyrightImage 'htdocs/c.png'

The templates and the htdocs/gallery.css file has been updated
so remember to copy them to your template dir and documentroot!

To use the new movie feature make sure you add the movie.tpl file
to your templates dir and copy the video-* files from htdocs to
your apache icons directory.

For users upgrading from 0.2 to 0.3:

There has been som changes to the templates. info.tpl and scale.tpl
were added and showpicture.tpl was changed a little.

InlineDir, imageinfo and imagesizes have been made configurable,
so please add

PerlSetVar   InlineDir '/usr/local/apache/Inline'
PerlSetVar   GalleryInfo 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash' 
PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 1024 1600 2272'

to your virtualhost.
