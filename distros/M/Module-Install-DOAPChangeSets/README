NAME
    Module::Install::DOAPChangeSets - write your distribution change log in
    RDF

DESCRIPTION
    This package allows you to write your Changes file in Turtle or RDF/XML
    and autogenerate a human-readable text file.

    To do this, create an RDF file called "meta/changes.ttl" (or something
    like that) and describe your distribution's changes in RDF using the
    Dublin Core, DOAP, and DOAP Change Sets vocabularies. Then in your
    Makefile.PL, include:

      write_doap_changes "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle";

    This line will read your data from the file named as the first argument,
    parse it using either Turtle or RDFXML parsers (the third argument), and
    output a human-readable changelog to the file named as the second
    argument.

    The defaults are "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes", "turtle", so if you name
    the files like that, then you can exclude all the arguments and just
    include this in your Makefile.PL:

      write_doap_changes;

    There's also a line you can use to output a Changes.xml file:

      write_doap_changes_xml "meta/changes.ttl", "Changes.xml", "turtle";

  Integration with Module::Install::RDF
    Module::Install::RDF reads all the RDF it can find in 'meta'. If you
    invoke Module::Install::RDF before invoking
    Module::Install::DOAPChangeSets, then this module will use
    Module::Install::RDF's copy of the data.

WHY?
    Why not?
