<a
    href=https://github.com/metaperl/xml-writer-compiler>XML::Writer::Compiler</a> 
is a tool for compiling XML into a series of methods which generate XML using
[mod://XML::Writer]. In a sense, it is similar to [mod://XML::Generator] because 
methods are creating XML, however, it only generates methods based on
sample XML instead of the free-form approach of XML::Generator. Thus,
there is no need for the AUTOLOAD
<CODE>(wizardry|games|hackery)</CODE> that Generator employs. It is
also similar to [mod://XML::Toolkit] because it generates classes
for XML. However, one XML file generates one class with
XML::Writer::Compiler. XML::Toolkit generates one class per tag within
a file. Also XML::Toolkit is class-based and refinement would be done
via numerous subclasses of each XML element. In XML::Compiler::Writer,
one subclass with several methods for various parts of the XML are all
that is needed.

<h2>Related things</h2>

There are many complete formats for XML generation from data
structures [id://787605|as seen here]. In reflecting on that thread, I
decided to work with the [mod://HTML::Element] approach since I'm very
familiar with it, it is robust, and has been in development for a long
time.

<h3>XML::Simple</h3>
There are a few reasons not
to use [mod://XML::Simple] 

<OL>
<LI>No support for XML generation requiring specific element
sequencing</LI>
<LI>No ability to generate mixed content</LI>
<LI>The author himself says XML::Simple is only for certain cases of
XML generation in [mod://XML::Simple::FAQ]
</LI>
</OL>

<h3>XML::Toolkit</h3>

<P>
Another similar module is [mod://XML::Toolkit] by [perigrin]. This
compiles a single XML file to a series of [mod://Moose] classes. I
experimented with this module early on. Personally I think a series of
methods in a single class might be more appropriate for programmatic
control of a single XML file. [perigrin] somewhat agrees with me
because we have both compared
[mod://DBIx::Class], which is object-based, with all other ORMS which
are limited by being class-based. (The ORM-talk is relevant because me
and [perigrin] both agree that XML::Toolkit is the
[mod://DBIx::Class::Loader] of XML).
Also, I found it to be quite verbose for
even a simple XML example. Perhaps a compiler-compiler could have
allowed for simpler usage. For instance to generate this XML:

<CODE>
 <note>
     <to>Bob</to>
     <from>Alice</from>
     <heading>Secret</heading>
     <body>Shhh!</body>
 </note>
</CODE>

you need this XML::Toolkit:

<CODE>
  my $document = MyApp::Note->new(
        to_collection => [MyApp::To->new(text => 'Bob')],
        from_collection => [MyApp::From->new(text => 'Alice')],
        headings => [MyApp::Heading->new(text => 'Secret' )],
        body_collection => [MyApp::Body->new(text=>'Shh!')],
    )
</CODE>

but only this much XML::Element::Tolol

<CODE>
my %data = ( to => 'Bob', 
  from => 'Alice',
  heading => 'Secret',
  Body => 'Shhh!'
);
MyApp::Note->new(data => \%data)->tree->as_XML;

</CODE>

In other words, one data definition, one constructor call and one
method class versus no data definition, 5 constructor calls.

<h3>attributes</h3>

The current compiler does have any support for regenerating XML attributes
from the supplied hashref of data
- only elements and content can be regenerated. This is unacceptable
in general, but perfectly fine for my immediate need, which was to
<a
    href=https://github.com/metaperl/XML--Quickbooks/blob/master/lib/XML/Quickbooks/Tolol/InvoiceAdd.pm>simplify
XML generation for calling quickbooks</a>. I've thought of a few ways
of representing attributes, but am not sure which is best:

<h4> arrayref </h4>
One possibility is when the key of a hash entry is an arrayref, to use
the first element as attributes and the second element and the
content:

<CODE>
my %data = ( george => [ { age => 45} , 'some content' ] );
</CODE>

<h4> separate hashref for attributes</h4>

This is just brainstorming, so here's another idea. One hash for
content another for attributes of the content:

<CODE>
my %data = ( george => 'some content' ] );
my %attr = ( george => {age 45 });
</CODE>

I think I like the former approach better.

<h3>iterated data</h3>

There is no support for automatically "unrolling" a section of XML
which needs to be repeated. Right now, I'm using splice, [mod://Data::Rmap]
and [mod://List::MoreUtils] to do arrayref mangling:

<CODE>

    # call the superclass to render the simple data in the hashref
    my $lol = do {
      local $self->{data} = \%tmpdata;
      super();
    };

    # now rewrite part of the loltree with repetition
    my @newlol;
    for my $invoice_line ( @{$array_rows_for_single_invoice} ) {
        my $aref = [
            InvoiceLineAdd =>
              [ ItemRef => [ ListID => $invoice_line->{product_listid} ] ],
            [ Amount => $invoice_line->{amount} ],
        ];
        push @newlol, $aref;
    }

    my ($dump) = rmap_array {
        if ( $_->[0] eq 'InvoiceAdd' ) {
            use List::MoreUtils qw(first_index);
            my $i = first_index { ref $_ and $_->[0] eq 'SetCredit' } @$_;
            splice @$_, ++$i, 1, @newlol;

            # No need to drill down any further
            cut($_);
        }
        else {
            $_;
        }

    }
    $lol;

</CODE>

<h3>schema by sample</h3>
Just like [mod://XML::Toolkit] a complete sample XML file is required
for compiling into a XML generator class. This is in contrast to
[mod://XML::Compile] by Mark Overmeer which uses XML schemas.
