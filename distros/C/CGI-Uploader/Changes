Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Uploader.

2.18  Feb 1, 2011

    [INTERNAL]

    - We now call "local $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS=0" just before uploading with
      CGI.pm or CGI::Simple. For improved security, set the related variable
      globally to "1" to disable file uploads by default, and then re-enable
      them any other places where you need uploading enabled. Read about
      $DISABLE_UPLOADS in CGI.pm or CGI::Simple for details.
      (Thanks to Brian Meeker for help with this patch.)

    - Now require Perl 5.8 as the minimum version. 

    - Address warning about $fm_mt being undefined.

2.17 Thu Apr  2 11:43:50 EDT 2009
    [BUG FIXES]
    - Small but fatal typo fix from 2.16 release cycle. 

2.16 Thu Apr  2 11:36:40 EDT 2009

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Using 'transform_method' to tranform an upload in place was broken.
    - Now use File::Spec instead of hardcoding "/" as a path separator. (Ron Savage) 
    - Use binmode() on the right file handle (Ron Savage)
    - upload_id was hardcoded in one place instead of using up_table_map (Ron Savage)

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - Quit recommending SQL::Abstract in the Cookbook (but we use it internally)

    [INTERNAL]
    - Mark "Image::Size" as a requirement, if only to get tests to stop failing.
      It's only really required if  you use the Image::Magick transformations. 


2.15 Sun Jul 15 07:21:24 EDT 2007
    - no functionality changes

    [INTERNAL]
    - improved importing code style.
    - Clarify docs regarding file_scheme vs. file_name (Jaldhar)

2.14 Thu May 24 13:19:27 EDT 2007

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Avoid SQL error when two column names are the same by giving explicit table name.

2.13 Mon Apr  9 22:39:54 EDT 2007

    [BUG FIXES]	
    - Better Mac OS X detection (Jeff MacDonald)
    - gen_thumb() now works if Image::Magick or Graphics::Magick
      is not already loaded. (Thanks to bug report by Jeff MacDonald,
      RT#20775).

2.12 Thu Feb 15 17:43:20 EST 2007

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Explicitly call File::Temp::cleanup(). This reduces the amount of 
      disk space and file handles used.

    - A new 'temp_dir' option has been added to allow to you set your own
      temporary directory. (Jeff MacDonald)

2.11 Mon Dec 19 20:18:00 EST 2005
    [BUG FIXES]
    - There were was confusion in the 2.1 release as to whether the new API
      for gen_thumb() took a hash or hashref as input. The code, tests and docs
      have all been updated to agree: It's a hashref. Thanks to bignose, who
      wrestled this one.

2.1 Sun Dec 18 21:39:23 EST 2005
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Further simplified necessary spec API, while maintaining backwards
      compatibility.  Specifying a transformation method for a generated file
      can now by this simple: 

       gen_files => {
           photo_thumbnail =>  gen_thumb({ w => 100, h => 100}),
       }


2.0 Sat Dec 17 23:12:35 EST 2005

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Previously the extension and MIME type were inherited
      by generated files. Now the metadata for generated files
      is extracted directly from them. This should be useful
      if you want to create thumbnails in a different image format
      than the large images. 

    - A cleaner and simpler API for calling gen_thumb() and other potential
      transform_methods has been introduced. The new syntax looks like this:

         transform_method => gen_thumb({ w => 100, h => 100 }),
   
      The old syntax is still supported.    

    - "gen_thumb()" can now return the Image/Graphics::Magick object as a
      second argument. This may not be useful outside of the test suite...

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Image::Magick is no longer required to install CGI::Uploader, just
      recommended.

    - If an uploaded was updated and had its MIME type changed in the process,
      the old file was left on the file system. Fixed. 

    - If 'up_table_map' was used to modify the name of the extension field, 
      then transform_meta() would return empty values for the extensions. Fixed.

    [INTERNALS]
    - Migrated Makefile.PL to use Module::Install. This allows me to keep the hairy 
      Makefile.PL stuff I have, but easily add 'no_index' and 'recommends' metadata.
    - test suite clean up.
    - new required modules: Scalar::Util and HTTP::Request::Common

1.2 Thu Dec 15 22:35:39 EST 2005
    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed bug in store_uploads() from improper hash usage.  

    [INTERNALS]
    - Fixed some typos in Makefile.PL requirements 
    - Made test suite use SQLite by default for easier testing. 

1.1 Wed Dec 14 21:23:56 EST 2005
    [INTERNALS]
    - Now require at least Params::Validate 0.77 (RT#13728)
    - ..and require at least File::Temp 0.14, for a better chance 
      of using a real temporary directory. 

1.1_1 Mon Apr  4 07:52:01 EST 2005
    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    - 'file_name' is now required in the data model. You can simply add it before upgrading.
      Something like this should work: 
        ALTER TABLE your_table_name ADD COLUMN file_name VARCHAR(255);

      Of course, you can name the column something else with the up_table_map. 

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - extract_meta() now also returns the original filename with the
      'file_name' key.

    - PostgreSQL via ODBC is now supported (William McKee)

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed RT#12051, an XSS issue in an example application. (William McKee).

    [INTERNALS]
    - Clean up some test warnings (Denis McKeon)
    - Better diagnostics in ImageMagick.pm (William McKee)

1.00
    - No code changes, I'm just declaring it stable. 
    - Mention availability via darcs

0.80_02 08/19/04 
    - Added missing ImageMagick.pm (Barbie)
    - Made t/up_table_map.t more portable (Barbie)

0.80_01
    [RELEASE NOTES]
    I changed the API again. The code has been refactored to remove all
    image-specific code from the main package. In it's place a more general 
    "transform_method" option has been added. With this, you can specify 
    any arbitrary transformation you want to make to a file.  You might 
    choose to decrypt a file, compress it, append to it, or otherwise alter
    it. 

    The thumbnailing code still exists, but has been moved to
    CGI::Uploader::Transform::ImageMagick::gen_thumb().

    However, most of the examples and tests still do rely on "gen_thumb()" for
    examples, so test failures will occur if Image::Magick is not installed for
    now. I'd like some help to streamline this. 

    Along the way, I removed the regular expression support to simplify the
    refactoring. It may well come back. 

    Beyond these changes, things are pretty much the same. Let me know
    if you have any feedback on the API before this turns into a stable
    1.0 release.

0.76.02
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	- Added image gallery recipe to cookbook
	- Added README to examples/friends_photos

0.76_01 Sun Apr 25, 2004
     [BUG FIXES]
     - Fixed syntax errors in Cookbook SQL example
     - Fixed bug where default query object wasn't loading correctly
     - Fixed documtention of fk_meta() to match current interface.
     - Fixed bug in t/up_table_map.t test
     
     [ENHANCEMENTS]
     - Added example application to distribution

0.75_02
    - Refactored delete_upload() to be simpler and more intuitive.

0.75_01
     Added support for specifying fields to process via regular expressions. 
    - Improved Cookbook documentation. 

0.70_02 Wed Apr 21, 2004
    - Removed custom_meta(). This problem space is now addressed by 
      allowing meta data to be passed to store_uploads(). Also, you could
      override extract_meta() to add more functionality there.
    - Added support for storing files based on a MD5 sum of the files 
      ID. This allows the file storage to scale well for millions of uploads.
      See the docs for 'file_scheme' for detaills. (Thanks to Randal Schwartz
      for the suggestion). 
    - Added option to specify only a max width or max height for thumbnails.
    - Refactored several interfaces to use named parameters. 
    - Added 'downsize' option to spec, allowing downsizing of primary images.

0.70_01
    - Added to binmode() calls to file handles, to possibly help Windows.
	- Added support for uploading via CGI::Simple
	- Added experimental support for uploading via Apache::Request
	- Added Cookbook documentation
	- Added 'thumbnail_of_id' column to meta data table.
    - Added delete_thumbs() method
    - Started to do real 'updates' rather than delete/re-inserts
	- Cleaned up prequisites in Makefile.PL
	- Fixed bug and added test for proper thumbnail resizing
    - More API refactors

0.63_01
    - Removed some un-needed mentions of Data::FormValidator from tests
    - added test to verify thumbnail size
    - refactored resize code into gen_thumb(). This will make it easier 
      to support other resize modules besides Image::Magick. 
    - Added Image::Size as a dependency. It's a fast tool for size checking
      which does not depend on a graphics module being installed. 
    - Initial support for resizing with GD as a backup. It needs tested. 

0.62_01
    - Added File::Temp to Makefile.PL. 
    - Refactored to remove store_thumb(). This should help eventually support other
      graphics modules besides Image::Magick

0.61_02
    - Minor POD cleanups

0.61_01
    - Added custom_meta() method for more flexible meta data handled
    - clarified code and extended documentation
    - exposed 'build_loc' function, which may be useful as a utility function,
      or for a sub-class.
    - custom fields are now returned with meta_hashref() 

0.60_02
    - Added up_table_map test and fixed some related code.

0.60_01
    - Added 'up_table_map' configuration option, allowing for custom column
      names.
    - Documentation for several functions added.
    - Began refactoring to make support for Apache::Request easier.

    - Removed dependence on Data::FormValidator

0.40_01 Sun Feb 8, 2004
    - Extensive documentation updates, thanks to feedback from David Manura.

0.30_01 Fri Feb 6, 2004 
    - The API was largely re-worked, with several methods renamed and a few
      added. No backwards compatibility can be expected. 

0.10  
	[THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
	- create_img_tmpl_vars() has been replaced
	  with a more generic create_tmpl_vars(). 
	  It should still work the same for images,
	  and better for non-images

	- install_uploads() Now returns a hash ref 
	based on the valid hash, with appropriate additions
	and deletions already made.

    - The interface for delete_upload() has changed to accomodate
	deleting based on directly providing a upload ID.

	- initial public release

0.01  Sat May 17 16:15:05 2003
