NAME
    Finance::Bank::CreditMut - Check your Crédit Mutuel accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS
     use Finance::Bank::CreditMut;

     my @accounts = Finance::Bank::CreditMut->check_balance(
        username => "$username",  # Be sure to put the numbers
        password => "$password",  # between quote.
     );

     foreach my $account ( @accounts ){
        local $\ = "\n";
        print "       Name ", $account->name;
        print " Account_no ", $account->account_no;
        print "  Statement\n";

        foreach my $statement ( $account->statements ){
            print $statement->as_string;
        }
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to the CyberMut online
    banking system at <https://www.creditmutuel.fr/>. You will need either
    Crypt::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL installed for HTTPS support to work
    with LWP.

    The interface of this module is directly taken from Briac Pilpré's
    Finance::Bank::BNPParibas.

WARNING
    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

METHODS
  check_balance( username => $username, password => $password, ua => $ua )
    Return a list of account (F::B::CM::Account) objects, one for each of
    your bank accounts. You can provide to this method a WWW::Mechanize
    object as third argument. If not, a new one will be created.

Account methods
  sort_code()
    Return the sort code of the account. Currently, it returns an undefined
    value.

  name()
    Returns the human-readable name of the account.

  account_no()
    Return the account number, in the form "XXXXXXXXX YY", where X and Y are
    numbers.

  balance()
    Returns the balance of the account.

  statements()
    Return a list of Statement object (Finance::Bank::CreditMut::Statement).

  currency()
    Returns the currency of the account as a three letter ISO code (EUR,
    CHF, etc.)

Statement methods
  date()
    Returns the date when the statement occured, in DD/MM/YY format.

  description()
    Returns a brief description of the statement.

  amount()
    Returns the amount of the statement (expressed in Euros or the account's
    currency). Although the Crédit Mutuel website displays number in
    continental format (i.e. with a coma as decimal separator), amount()
    returns a real number.

  as_string($separator)
    Returns a tab-delimited representation of the statement. By default, it
    uses a tabulation to separate the fields, but the user can provide its
    own separator.
