NAME
    Types::Encodings - type constraints for Bytes and Chars

DESCRIPTION
    Additional type constraints and coercions to complement Types::Standard.

  Type constraints
    `Str`
        Alias for Types::Standard type constraint of the same name.

    `Bytes`
        Strings where `utf8::is_utf8()` is false.

    `Chars`
        Strings where either `utf8::is_utf8()` is true, or each byte is below
        0x7F.

  Coercions
    `Encode[`a]`
        Coercion to encode a character string to a byte string using
        `Encode::encode()`. This is a parameterized type coercion, which
        expects a character set:

           use Types::Standard qw( Bytes Encode );
   
           has filename => (
              is     => "ro",
              isa    => Bytes->plus_coercions( Encode["utf-8"] ),
              coerce => 1,
           );

    `Decode[`a]`
        Coercion to decode a byte string to a character string using
        `Encode::decode()`. This is a parameterized type coercion, which
        expects a character set.
