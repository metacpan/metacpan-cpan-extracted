NAME
    Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Twitter - Twitter authentication
    for Catalyst

SYNOPSIS
    In MyApp.pm

     use Catalyst qw/
        Authentication
        Session
        Session::Store::FastMmap
        Session::State::Cookie
            Session::PerUser
     /;
 
     MyApp->config(
         "Plugin::Authentication" => {
             default_realm => "twitter",
             realms => {
                 twitter => {
                     credential => {
                         class => "Twitter",
                     },

                     consumer_key    => 'twitter-consumer_key-here',
                     consumer_secret => 'twitter-secret-here',
                     callback_url => 'http://mysite.com/callback',
                                     # you can bypass the above by including
                                     # "twitter_consumer_key", "twitter_consumer_secret", 
                                     # and "twitter_callback_url" in your Catalyst site
                                     # configuration or yml file
                 },
             },
         },
     );

    And then in your Controller:

     sub login : Local {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;
    
        my $realm = $c->get_auth_realm('twitter');
        $c->res->redirect( $realm->credential->authenticate_twitter_url($c) );
     }

    And finally the callback you specified in your API key request above
    (e.g. example.com/twitter/callback/ ):

     sub callback : Local {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;
    
        if (my $user = $c->authenticate(undef,'twitter')) {
                    # user has an account - redirect or do something cool
            $c->res->redirect("/super/secret/member/area");
            }
            else {
                    # user doesn't have an account - either detect Twitter
                    # credentials and create one, or return an error.
                    #
                    # Note that "request_token" and "request_token_secret"
                    # are stored in $c->user_session as hashref variables under
                    # the same names
            }
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module handles Twitter API authentication in a Catalyst
    application.

METHODS
    As per guidelines of Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication, there are two
    mandatory methods, "new" and "authenticate". Since this is not really
    enough for the Twitter API, I've added one more.

  new()
    Will not be called by you directly, but will use the configuration you
    provide (see above). Mandatory parameters are "consumer_key",
    "consumer_secret" and "callback_url". Note that you can also include
    "twitter_consumer_key", "twitter_consumer_secret", and
    "twitter_callback_url" as variables in your Catalyst site configuration
    or yml file and you don't need to pass configuration parameters in your
    MyApp.pm file. Please see Net::Twitter for more details on them.

  authenticate_twitter_url( $c )
    This method will return the authentication URL. Bounce your users there
    before calling the "authentication" method.

  authenticate( )
    Handles the authentication. Nothing more, nothing less. It returns a
    Catalyst::Authentication::User::Hash with the following keys (all coming
    straight from Twitter).

    twitter_user
    twitter_user_id
    twitter_access_token
    twitter_access_token_secret

    Your database must at least contain a column called "twitter_user_id" in
    your main user table. If the other keys are present they will be updated
    on login with Twitter's most up-to-date information for that user.

  authenticate_twitter( )
    Only performs the twitter authentication. Returns a hashref containing
    the user's information given by Twitter (see "authenticate()" above for
    the lists of keys returned).

  twitter_user()
    Contains the user's twitter information after a successful twitter
    authentication via "authenticate_twitter()" or "authenticate()". Useful
    if, for example, you want to create users on-the-fly:

        sub twitter_callback :Path( 'twitter/callback' ) {
            my ($self, $c) = @_;

            my $twitter = $c->get_auth_realm('twitter')->credential;
            my $user =  $twitter->authenticate( $c );

            # properly authenticated against twitter,
            # user just doesn't exist yet
            if ( !$user and  $twitter->twitter_user ) {
                $user = $self->model->create_user( $twitter->twitter_user );
            }

            # etc
        }
