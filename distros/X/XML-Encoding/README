NAME

    XML::Encoding - A perl module for parsing XML encoding maps.

SYNOPSIS

    use XML::Encoding;
    my $em_parser = new XML::Encoding(ErrorContext  => 2,
                                      ExpatRequired => 1,
                                      PushPrefixFcn => \&push_prefix,
                                      PopPrefixFcn  => \&pop_prefix,
                                      RangeSetFcn   => \&range_set);

    my $encmap_name = $em_parser->parsefile($ARGV[0]);

DESCRIPTION

    This module, which is built as a subclass of XML::Parser, provides a parser
    for encoding map files, which are XML files. The file maps/encmap.dtd in the
    distribution describes the structure of these files. Calling a parse method
    returns the name of the encoding map (obtained from the name attribute of
    the root element). The contents of the map are processed through the
    callback functions push_prefix, pop_prefix, and range_set.
