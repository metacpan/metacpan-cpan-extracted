AE-AdHoc

AE::AdHoc is a simple interface around AnyEvent intended for tests, examples,
and hastily written scripts.

It boils down to:

    use AE::AdHoc;

    my $result = ae_recv {
        do_something ( # the code under test
            on_success => ae_send,  # callback - all done, stop event loop
            on_failure => ae_croak, # callback - something happened, abort event loop
        );
    } 10; # timeout - fail test if it takes too long

    # later
    is ($result, $excepted_result, "...");

This module is under development for now.
