NAME
    Test::Method - test sugar for methods

VERSION
    version 0.001002

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::More;
            use Test::Method;

            my $obj = Class->new; # blessed reference

            method_ok( $obj, 'method', [], 'value' ); # Class->method() is value

            method_ok( $obj, 'method', undef, 'value' ); # Class->method() is value

            method_ok( $obj, 'method', ['arg1', 'arg2'], 'expected', 'testname' );
            # testname Class->method(...) is 'expected'

            use Test::Deep;
            method_ok( $obj, 'method', [], re('^foo'), );
            # Test->method() is Test::Deep::Regexp

            done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
    The reason for creating Test::Method is to provide an easy way of
    testing methods without writing a test name which could equate to
    Object, method name, arguments, expected return. I found my test names
    suffered from lack of appropriate details simply due to lack of desire
    for repetitive typing. This module should help reduce this. The ultimate
    goal of this module is to make testing methods on objects easier and
    less repetitive.

    We're using Test::Deep under the hood so you may use it's comparison
    functions in place of expected.

FUNCTIONS
  method_ok
            method_ok( $obj, 'method', \@method_args, 'expected', 'testname' );

    use for testing a single method in an object, if not passing args use
    undef or an empty arrayref will work. Unlike most testing modules
    specifying test name will not replace all of the default test name,
    instead it is simply prepended. This feature was desirable due to some
    object names not really being obvious as to what I was looking at, so it
    allows me to give a hint to the parent object or maybe a grander
    purpose.
