OWL-Simple

This package contains a set of modules to parse
an OWL ontology into a hash.

SCRIPTS

The similarity_match.pl compares a list of annotations to 
another ontology and suggests the best match based on a 
similarity metric (n-grams). 

Usage:
    similarity_match.pl (-w owlfile || -o obofile || -m meshfile)
                        -t targetfile -r resultfile
                        [--obotarget || --owltarget]

Optional '--obotarget' setting specifies that the target file is an OBO ontology
Optional '--owltarget' setting specifies that the target file is an OWL ontology

The script expects the first column in the tab delimited input
flat file to contain the values to be matched. Other columns
are preserved in the output.

It is also possible to align one ontology to another and the 
accepted formats are: OWL, OBO, MeSH ASCII (see the optional obotarget
and owltarget parameters).
