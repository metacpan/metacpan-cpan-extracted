NAME
    Template::Toolkit::Simple - A Simple Interface to Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
          use Template::Toolkit::Simple;

          print tt
              ->path(['./', 'template/'])
              ->data('values.yaml')
              ->post_chomp
              ->render('foo.tt');

    or from the command line:

          tt-render --path=./:template/ --data=values.yaml --post-chomp foo.tt

DESCRIPTION
    Template Toolkit is the best Perl template framework. The only problem
    with it is that using it for simple stuff is a little bit cumbersome.
    Also there is no good utility for using it from the command line.

    This module is a simple wrapper around Template Toolkit. It exports a
    function called "tt" which returns a new Template::Toolkit::Simple
    object. The object supports method calls for setting all the Template
    Toolkit options.

    This module also installs a program called "tt-render" which you can use
    from the command line to render templates with all the power of the Perl
    object. All of the object methods become command line arguments in the
    command line version.

COMMAND LINE USAGE
    This command renders the named file and prints the output to STDOUT. If
    an error occurs, it is printed to STDERR.

        tt-render [template-options] file-name

TEMPLATE PATH
    When using Template::Toolkit::Simple or "tt-render", the most common
    parameters you will use are the main template file name and the
    directory of supporting templates. As a convenience, you can specify
    these together.

    This:

        tt->render('foo//bar/baz.tt');
        > tt-render foo//bar/baz.tt  # command line version

    is the same as:

        tt->include_path('foo/')->render('bar/baz.tt');
        > tt-render --include_path=foo/ bar/baz.tt  # command line version

    Just use a double slash to separate the path from the template. This is
    extra handy on the command line, because (at least in Bash) tab
    completion still works after you specify the '//'.

EXPORTED SUBROUTINES
    tt  Simply returns a new Template::Toolkit::Simple object. This is
        Simple sugar for:

            Template::Toolkit::Simple->new();

        It takes no parameters.

METHODS
    This section describes the methods that are not option setting methods.
    Those methods are described below.

    new()
        Return a new Template::Toolkit::Simple object. Takes no parameters.

    render($template, $data);
        This is the method that actually renders the template. It is similar
        to the Template Toolkit "process" method, except that it actually
        returns the template result as a string. It returns undef if an
        error occurs.

        The $data field is optional and can be set with the "data" method.

        If you need more control, see the process command below:

    process($template, $data, $output, %options);
        This command is simply a proxy to the Template Toolkit "process"
        command. All the parameters you give it are passed to the real
        "process" command and the result is returned. See Template for more
        information.

    output($filepath)
        Specify a filepath to print the template result to.

    error()
        This method is a proxy to the Template Toolkit "error" method. It
        returns the error message if there was an error.

OPTION METHODS
    All of the Template Toolkit options are available as methods to
    Template::Toolkit::Simple objects, and also as command line options to
    the "tt- render" command.

    For example, the "POST_CHOMP" options is available in the following
    ways:

        tt->post_chomp      # turn POST_CHOMP on
        tt->post_chomp(1)   # turn POST_CHOMP on
        tt->post_chomp(0)   # turn POST_CHOMP off

        --post_chomp        # turn POST_CHOMP on
        --post-chomp        # same. use - instead of _
        --post_chomp=1      # turn POST_CHOMP on
        --post_chomp=0      # turn POST_CHOMP off

    If the method functionality is not explained below, please refer to
    Template.

    "config($file_name || $hash)"
        If you have a common set of Template Toolkit options stored in a
        file, you can use this method to read and parse the file, and set
        the appropriate options.

        The currently supported file formats are YAML, JSON and XML. The
        format is determined by the file extension, so use the appropriate
        one. Note that XML::Simple is used to parse XML files and JSON::XS
        is used to parse JSON files.

    "data($file_name || $hash)"
        Most templates use a hash object of data to access values while
        rendering. You can specify this data in a file or with a hash
        reference.

        The currently supported file formats are YAML, JSON and XML. The
        format is determined by the file extension, so use the appropriate
        one. Note the XML::Simple is used to parse XML files.

    "include_path($template_directories)"
        Default is undef

        This method allows you to specify the directories that are searched
        to find templates. You can specify this as a string containing a
        single directory, an array ref of strings containing directory
        names, or as a string containing multiple directories separated by
        ':'.

    "path()"
        Default is undef

        This is a shorter name for "include_path". It does the exact same
        thing.

    "start_tag()"
        Default is '[%'

    "end_tag()"
        Default is '%]'

    "tag_style()"
        Default is 'template'

    "pre_chomp()"
        Default is 0

    "post_chomp()"
        Default is 0

    "trim()"
        Default is 0

    "interpolate()"
        Default is 0

    "anycase()"
        Default is 0

    "delimiter()"
        Default is ':'

    "absolute()"
        Default is 0

    "relative()"
        Default is 0

    "strict()"
        Default is 0

    "default()"
        Default is undef

    "blocks()"
        Default is undef

    "auto_reset()"
        Default is 1

    "recursion()"
        Default is 0

    "eval_perl()"
        Default is 0

    "pre_process()"
        Default is undef

    "post_process()"
        Default is undef

    "process_template()"
        Default is undef

        This is a proxy to the Template Toolkit PROCESS option. The
        "process" method is used to actually process a template.

    "error_template()"
        Default is undef

        This is a proxy to the Template Toolkit ERROR option. The "error()"
        method returns the error message on a failure.

    "debug()"
        Default is 0

    "cache_size()"
        Default is undef

    "compile_ext()"
        Default is undef

    "compile_dir()"
        Default is undef

    "encoding()"
        Default is 'utf8'
