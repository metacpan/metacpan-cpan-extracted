NAME
    ShipIt::Step::CheckVersionsMatch - Check that all modules with a
    $VERSION match

SYNOPSIS
      steps = FindVersion, ChangeVersion, CheckChangeLog, CheckVersionsMatch, DistTest, Tag, MakeDist

DESCRIPTION
    So the Moose distribution, of which I'm a maintainer, has a $VERSION in
    every damn module (not my idea). This ShipIt step checks to make sure
    that they all match.
