NAME
    Canary::Stability - canary to check perl compatibility for schmorp's
    modules

SYNOPSIS
     # in Makefile.PL
     use Canary::Stability DISTNAME => 2001, MINIMUM_PERL_VERSION;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used by Schmorp's modules during configuration stage to
    test the installed perl for compatibility with his modules.

    It's not, at this stage, meant as a tool for other module authors,
    although in principle nothing prevents them from subscribing to the same
    ideas.

    See the Makefile.PL in Coro or AnyEvent for usage examples.
