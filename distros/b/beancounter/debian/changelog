beancounter (0.8.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor update and fixes thanks to a set of excellent patches 
    contributed by Pieter du Preez:

    o [BeanCounter.pm, beancounter]: Call finish() on all DBI statement
      handles, and added some other Perl/SQL code improvement
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm, beancounter]: More undefined variable tests
    
    o [BeanCounter.pm]: Simplify and generalize DBI connection code

    o [BeanCounter.pm]: Improve representation of currency code mapping

    o [beancounter]: Correct second date in backpopulation example
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm]: Added checks for defined DBI statement handles

beancounter (0.8.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor updates and fixes:

    o [BeanCounter.pm] Additional check against empty currency name.
  
    o [beancounter] New command 'host' to define hostname for database
      server on command-line (as well as via ~/.beancounterrc). 

    o [BeanCounter.pm] If hostname is equal to the default 'localhost',
      do not connect via tcp/ip to PostgreSQL or MySQL but just use 
      sockets. This may help new users who are unsure how to make 
      their database engines network-aware.
   
    o [beancounter] Advances/retracement display now in 79 columns.  
  
 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Feb 2006 21:41:27 -0600

beancounter (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor updates and fixes:

    o [beancounter] New command 'lspositions' for simple display
      of all positions, not aggregated.

    o [setup_beancounter] Volume column in stockprices table is now
      of type numeric; conversion has to be manual (i.e. dump data;
      recreate schema, reload data) as this is so tedious to code
      for all three backend. Also add SP500 index via symbol ^GSPC
      in example setup to use the volume column with data that 
      exceeds the storage of a four-byte int (the previosu choice).
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm] Allow market cap in trillions as sometimes
      seen (in error) for British stocks quotes in pence.
      Thanks to Robert A. Schmied for the patch.
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm] New function DatabaseHistoricalUCBFX
      for historical FX backpopulation via the service at the Sauder 
      School of UBC in Vancouver. New function GetFXDatum for a single
      FX data item.
    
    o [BeanCounter.pm] Renamed UpdateFXviaPACIFIC to UpdateFXviaUBC
  
    o [beancounter] Renamed switch --pacificfx to --ubcfx to select 
      UBC for FX backpopulation and daily updates
   
    o [BeanCounter.pm] Update currency codes for Yahoo! service (e.g,
      switching CAD's symbol from ^XAD to ^XAY), but still no backpopulation
      capabilities at Yahoo!, and not entirely satisfied with UBC's service
      either.
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm, beancounter] Minor variable renaming and cleanups.

    o [debian/control] Standard-Version: now 3.6.2

beancounter (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor update containing a few extensions and fixes 

    o [beancounter] New command-line option --splitby  to 
      split-adjust historical data 
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm] Additional test adjusted-close series to
      ensure adjusted close and close series are non-zero.

    o [BeanCounter.pm] Correction to market-cap display for smaller stocks

    o [setup_beancounter] Example portfolio simplified to US-only to
      avoid continued unavailability of FX quotes at Yahoo!
  
    o [debian/copyright] Updated source URL to dirk.eddelbuettel.com
  
    o [MANIFEST] Include debian/copyright

beancounter (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor update release which adds support for SQLite3
  
    o [setup_beancounter] Updated to use sqlite3 as the new default,
      but added new option '-o $file' to create databases for the 
      previous release of SQLite (which uses an incompatible format
      relative to SQLite v3.*). 
  
    o [beancounter, BeanCounter.pm] Accordingly, updated such that 
      SQLite is still the default (but expects a version 3.* database)
      yet allows for version 2.* databases with the newly added 
      option --dbsystem=SQLite2
  
    o On the Perl side of things, we now require DBD::SQLite releases
      1.0.* or later (which match SQLite v3.*) as the default. Access
      to older SQLite databases is possible via DBD::SQLite2, the 
      compatibility package.  
  
    o This setup allows users to continue to use existing (v2) SQLite
      databases, as well as to continue to create them under this older
      version should they so desire --- but offers the newer and more 
      featureful version 3.* of SQLite as the new default. 
  
    o Beancounter users employing either PostgreSQL or MySQL are not 
      affected by this in any form.  
  
    o [debian/control] Depends updated accordingly

      before or equal to request date to deal better with non-biz days
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm] Support --commit argument to database updates
  
    o [BeanCounter.pm] Added check for data in DatabaseInfoData(); added
      function ExistsInfoSymbol to implement the lookup

    o [BeanCounter.pm] Added simple FX retrieval heuristic (employing the
      ISO symbol) in ScrubDailyData()
  
    o [debian/control] Also 'OR'ed Depends on libdbd-sqlite-perl and sqlite

     - [beancounter]: Correct documentation of 'passwd' option for db 
       connection from 'password' to 'passwd'  (Closes: #255640)
     
     - [beancounter]: Add simple command 'checkdbconnection' that exits
       with testable error code if db connection can be opened + closed
  
     - [setup_beancounter]: Make use of 'checkdbconnection' test 

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jun 2004 18:23:45 -0500

beancounter (0.7.4) unstable; urgency=low

  *  Bug fix release with several contributed patches:
  
     - [BeanCounter.pm]: Added portfolio export function GetPortfolioData 
       which will eventually be used by smtm and others, provided by Kevin Kim
  
     - [BeanCounter.pm]: Ensure proxy information is set, provided by Joao 
       Costa
  
     - [BeanCounter.pm]: Ensure data written to stockprices table has no NAs  
       good data should never be overwritten by bad data, also provided by 
       Joao Costa

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Jun 2004 21:19:52 -0500

beancounter (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix release:

    - [BeanCounter.pm] For backpopulation of foreign exchange data, divide
      all data with dates past Dec 30, 2003, by a factor of 100.0 to account
      for Yahoo's change from a 'dollars' to 'cents' scale.
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm] For backpopulation of prices and fx series, skip over
      the newly added html comment line Yahoo! decided to throw in there. 
      Thanks to Robert A. Schmied for the heads-up on this.
  
    - [Makefile.PL] Be less restrictive and require onky DBI; as any one of  
      four DBD modules could be used, it makes no sense to impose on (Pg) on
      everybody.
  
    - [debian/rules] Integrated 'perl Makefile.PL; make dist' needed for
      proper CPAN uploads into the normal 'update' from the my sources

beancounter (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix release:

    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Scale FX data retrieved after 20040226 by a factor 
      of 100 to correct for Yahoo's move from dollars to cents. Initial 
      patch by Phil Homewood augmented with Date_Cmp() use.
  
    - README.non-gnu: small corrections by Robert A. Schmied
  
    - t/01base.t: Added simple and relatively meaningless test at the
      repeated request of the good folks at CPAN. Beancounter really needs
      and existing database to work with which we can't assume at build
      time, so the testing potential is somewhat limited. As we load the
      module, most of the (run-time) Depends now need to be in Build-Depends.
    - debian/control: Augmented Build-Depends accordingly
  
 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Mar 2004 21:22:44 -0600

        parantheses at the end of function defintions for ksh compatibiliy
  
  * New documentation files added just in case:

  * Bug fix release:

      - [BeanCounter.pm:] Applied patch by Thomas Walter which corrects the SQL

beancounter (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following new features:

    - Switched to using Finance::YahooQuote (>= 0.18) for quote
      gathering after code we had here has been consolidated in the
      module. This may require adjusting of (numeric) stock symbols for 
      which updated_beancounter attempts to test.
  
    - New command 'fxbackpopulate' to grab historical currency data from
      Yahoo!. With this added capability, portfolios with non-home country
      stocks can run reports for profit/loss or risk without having to
      built the database over time.
  
      The major bummer is that Yahoo! stores historic currency data in 
      a braindead format of only two decimals so we get suboptimal 
      accuracy. 
  
    - Changed setup_beancounter to transform example portfolio into one
      composed of one stock each from US, CA, FR and DE. Backpopulates 
      for prices and currencies and runs p/l and risk reports right
      out of the box.
  
    - Simplified quote gathering code in BeanCounter.pm; requests for all 
      markets can go against the main Yahoo! server.

    - Applied patch by Ken Neighbors <ken@nsds.com> to use a different 
      Yahoo! source URL for historic prices, correct a one-off error in 
      date / month conversion and correct documentation.

  * Detailed changes

    - [beancounter:] New command (and function) 'fxbackpopulate'
  
    - pbeancounter:] Corrected small mistakes in documentation via Ken's
      patch, added documentation and examples re 'fxbackpopulate'
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Ken's patch re other URL, and one-off month error
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] New function DatabaseHistoricalFXData
    
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Commented out a lot of code no longer required as
      all current price data can be had from one main Yahoo! source
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Ensure new rows in 'stockinfo' table are set to
      active

    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Use Finance::YahooQuote, delete code thus made
      redundant 
  
    - [setup_beancounter:] Updated HP to HPQ (from HWP) in Dow example 
  
    - [setup_beancounter:] Changed example portfolio from two US stocks to
      one each from US,CA,FR,DE, added fxbackpopulate call for CAD and EUR
  
    - [setup_beancounter:] Smartened up the use of 'last business day' 
      for the example portfolio: on weekends or Monday we use 'last 
      friday', on other days we use 'yesterday' and made sure all 
      example reports use this date

beancounter (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * [setup_beancounter:] Fill beancounter table with current version number 
    and current date right after the table is created. 
  
  * [debian/rules:] Making sure $version is updated in beancounter, 
    update_beancounter and setup_beancounter

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Mar 2002 19:38:57 -0600

beancounter (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following new features:

    - New command 'retracement' to calculate drawdowns for the given data
      period -- these are defined as price decreases relative to the
      maximum price in the period. This can be seen as hypothetical
      unrealized losses relative to the would-coulda-shouda optimal selling
      price. Shorts are treated the other way relative to their lows.
   
    - New command 'advancement' which does the same for gains relative to lows.
  
    - Applied patch by Peter Kim <pykim@gte.net> so that 'update' now
      batches queries in round lots of one hundred symbols.
   
    - The backpopulate command is now idempotent too: it can now be run 
      even if data already exists and will use either 'insert' or 'update'
      as required.
  
    - The stockinfo table has a new column 'active' allowing to flag 
      inactive stocks (or e.g. expired options) with a 'false' value.
  
    - The database has a new table 'beancounter' with fields for the
      current version (to ensure code and database schema match) and
      the most recent update.
  
  * Detailed changes

    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Applied Peter's patch, pluse comments / indents

    - [BeanCounter.pm:] New function GetRetracementData

    - [BeanCounter.pm:] New function UpdateTimestamp

    - [beancounter:] New function portfolio_retracement
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Rewrote DatabaseHistoricalData for idempotency
 
    - [beancounter:] Example now uses full example with purchase date / time
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Rewrote SQL restriction for getting price data
  
    - Database scheme:] New field 'active' to flag inactive stocks / options
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Make use of 'active' field when retrieving data
  
    - [BeanCounter.pm:] Simpliefied API for ExistsDailyData()
  
    - [setup_beancounter:] Added creation of active field in stockinfo
  
    - [update_beancounter:] Idem
  
  * debian/control: Spelling correction (Closes: #124442)
  * debian/control: Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.5.0

beancounter (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following new features

    - Support for MySQL has been added: beancounter can now work with both
      PostgreSQL and MySQL, including all steps up from the database creation

    - The update command's SQL query has been rewritten so that all stocks
      known to beancounter are updated, yet still allows the use of the
      --restriction option to specify only subsets of the portfolio

    - The update command is now idempotent: it can now be run several
      times during a trading day; the initial data set will be 'insert'ed,
      following ones 'update'd (this comes at the cost of an additional query)

    - Better support of old, expired or delisted stocks: unparseable
      dates, as well as dates that "too old" (where the current default 5
      business days) are set to N/A; and dates which test for N/A are neither
      scrubbed nor databased during the "update" command.
  
    - Database backend and database name can now be set as parameters which
      facilitates multiple databases and backends to be used in parallel
  
    - New (boolean) option --fxupdate which defauls to 'true', hence the
      use of --nofxupdate prevents any updates to the FX database

    - Database scheme change in stockprices table: column names changed to
      day_open, day_close, day_change for consistency (and MySQL gripes).
      Similarly, index becomes stockindex in the indices table. Hence, 
      users /upgrading from an older version/ must run update_beancounter.

    - [BeanCounter.pm] --verbose and --debug now passed to DBI connection
      for Warn and PrintError, respectively

      defaulting to PostgreSQL and beancounter

beancounter (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following code changes

    - new command "risk" for report with value-at-risk at (VaR) percentile
      estimates, using both the standard (parametric) approach as well as
      a nonparametric quantile estimate
      "risk" also computes marginal value-at-risk (slow for large portfolios)
      "risk" requires the Statistics::Descriptive modules

    - new option "--forceupdate <date>" to permit overriding of a faulty
      date supplied by Yahoo! Finance (which is becoming more common)

    - new command "allreports" for dayend, status and risk reports all in once

    - added status and risk reports to jobs ran by "dailyjob" command

    - new ScrubDailyData routine; currently only using the "--forceupdate
      date" check on the pricing date supplied by Yahoo!

    - prevdate defaults to "six months ago" (better default for risk report)

    - "status" also shows cash holding from table `cash' (preliminary feature)

    - improved internal logic for argument and option checking + db connection

    - improved report calculations, report display and documentation

    - documentation corrected (command is 'delete', not 'deletestock')
