NAME
    Search::Mousse - A simple and fast inverted index

SYNOPSIS
      my $mousse = Search::Mousse->new(
        directory => $directory,
        name      => 'recipes',
      );
      my $recipe = $mousse->fetch("Hearty Russian Beet Soup");
      my @recipes = $mousse->search("crumb");
      my @recipe_keys = $mousse->search_keys("italian soup");
  
DESCRIPTION
    Search::Mousse provides a simple and fast inverted index.

    It is intended for constant databases (this is why it can be fast).
    Documents have a key, keywords (which the document can later be search
    for with) and a value (which can be a Perl data structure or object).

    Use Search::Mousse::Writer to construct a database.

    The default stemmer is:

      sub {
        my $words = lc shift;
        return uniq(split / /, $words);
      }

    Why is it called Search::Mousse? Well, in culinary terms, mousses are
    simple to make, can include quite complicated ingredients, and are
    inverted before presentation.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    The constructor takes a few arguments: the directory to store files in,
    and a name for the database. If you have a custom stemmer, also pass it
    in:

      my $mousse = Search::Mousse->new(
        directory => $directory,
        name      => 'recipes',
      );
  
      my $mousse2 = Search::Mousse->new(
        directory => $directory,
        name      => 'photos',
        stemmer   => \&stemmer,
      );

METHODS
  fetch
    Returns a value from the database, given a key:

      my $recipe = $mousse->fetch("Hearty Russian Beet Soup");

  fetch_related
    If you have used Search::Mousse::Writer::Related to analyse the
    database, the fetch_related() method returns a list of values that are
    similar to the given key:

      my @recipes = $mousse->fetch_related("Hearty Russian Beet Soup");

  fetch_related_keys
    If you have used Search::Mousse::Writer::Related to analyse the
    database, the fetch_related_keys() method returns a list of keys that
    are similar to the given key:

      my @keys = $mousse->fetch_related_keys("Hearty Russian Beet Soup");
  
  search
    Returns a list of values that have all the keywords passed:

      my @recipes = $mousse->search("white bread");

  search_keys
    Returns a list of keys that have all the keywords passed:

      my @recipe_keys = $mousse->search_keys("italian soup");
