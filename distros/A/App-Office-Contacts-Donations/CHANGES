Revision history for Perl extension App::Office::Contacts::Donations.

1.10  Wed May 19  11:11:00 2010
	- Update comments re starman usage in donations.psgi.
	- Update version numbers in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

1.09  Tue Apr 20  9:16:00 2010
	- Change SQLite attribute from unicode to sqlite_unicode.
	- Change the default database driver from Postgres to SQLite,
		to make installation easier (by not requiring DBD::Pg).
		If using another database server, you'll need to edit the 2 lines
		in .htoffice.donations.conf which refer to SQLite.

1.08  Fri Apr 16  8:52:00 2010
	- Rework cookies and POST validation, to allow Contacts, Donations and
		Import::vCards to run in parallel.
	- But for the moment use the disabled code in App::Office::Contacts.

1.07  Wed Apr  7  8:51:00 2010
	- Update pre-reqs for Test::Pod to 1.41 to avoid Test::Pod's dithering
		about a POD construct I used: L<text|scheme:...>, which makes a test fail.
		See comments for V 1.40 and 1.41 at:
		http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/DWHEELER/Test-Pod-1.42/Changes
	- Update pre-reqs from Test::More V 0 to Test::Simple 0.94.

1.06  Tue Mar 30 12:45:00 2010
	- Set pre-reqs version of App::Office::Contacts to 1.06.
		This is in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

1.05  Tue Mar  2  9:28:00 2010
	- In cgiapp_prerun() protect against XSS and CSRF:
		o Only accept CGI params if the request method is 'POST'.
		o Ensure pseudo-random number among params matches cookie.
	- Change 'use base' to 'use parent'.
	- Remove form_action from config file. See sub script_name.
	- Replace references to FCGI with Plack. This includes no longer
		shipping FCGI-specific files and patches to Apache's httpd.conf.
	- Ship httpd/cgi-bin/office/donations.psgi.
	- Adopt Log::Dispatch::Configurator.
		See App::Office::Contacts::Util::LogConfig.
	- Replace Carp::croak with die, assuming calling code uses Try::Tiny.
	- Stop using Time::Elapsed (at table create/populate time).
	- In drop.tables.pl and create.tables.pl, change the 'verbose+' option
		definition to 'verbose', since the '+' doesn't make sense.
	- Add comments to .htoffice.donations.conf, while simplifying the
		discussion of the Javascript URL.
	- Change the default URL of the FAQ.
	- Add stand-alone faq.html for the FAQ, copied from App::Office::Contacts.
	- Use common::sense instead of strict and warnings.
	- Add unicode to .htoffice.donations.conf - used by SQLite - and add
		corresponding code to BEGIN{} in App::Office::Contacts::Database,
		in case anyone wants to use DBD::SQLite.

1.04  Sun Feb 21 12:54:15 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.
	- Replace personal doc root with /var/www.
	- Use namespace::autoclean with Moose.

1.03  Fri Feb  5 17:27:00 2010
	- Remove personal use lib from CGI scripts.
 	- Change .../cgi/... to .../app/... in dirs and config file.
	- Fix some scripts which still referred to CGI*.

1.02  Fri Jan 29 09:52:00 2010
	- Change namespace from CGI::Office::* to App::Office::* after discussion with Matt Trout

1.00  Thu Dec 31 10:48:00 2009
