NAME
    App::ManUtils - Utilities related to man(page)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.002 of App::ManUtils (from Perl
    distribution App-ManUtils), released on 2022-11-16.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This distribution includes several utilities related to man(page):

    *   list-manpage-sections

    *   list-manpages

    *   manlist

    *   manlistsect

    *   manwhich

FUNCTIONS
  manlist
    Usage:

     manlist(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List manpages.

    This utility is like "apropos" (and indeed it uses "apropos" mostly) but
    returned structured results.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   detail => *bool*

        (No description)

    *   use_mandb => *bool* (default: 1)

        (No description)

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  manlistsect
    Usage:

     manlistsect() -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    List manpage sections.

    This function is not exported.

    No arguments.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second

  manwhich
    Usage:

     manwhich(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Get path to manpage.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   all => *bool*

        Return all found paths for each page instead of the first one.

    *   pages* => *array[str]*

        (No description)

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
