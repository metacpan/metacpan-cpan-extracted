Algorithm-QuineMcCluskey, version 0.16

NOTE: Although the API is currently stable as an independent stand-alone
module, it is being viewed as a sub-object for another, more encompassing
module (currently under development). The object methods will probably
be unchanged, but the utility and formatting functions may not only
change but in some cases may move to another module.

This module creates objects designed to solve boolean expressions via the
Quine-McCluskey algorithm. Its effectiveness is dependent on the size of
problem; the number of minterms that can be set goes up exponentially with
the number of variables. However, as speed and memory have improved, the
upper limit of what is practical to solve has also risen, so your problem's
solution may be within range of this algorithm's ability.
