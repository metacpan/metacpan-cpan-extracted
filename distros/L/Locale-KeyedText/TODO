---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO

* Consider raising the version number to 2.x, considering the wide scale
compatability breaks between the rewrite and previous stable releases.

* Write the DIAGNOSTICS and other pending documentation in KeyedText.pm,
and write the POD for en.pm, removing sections if not applicable.

* Update translate_message() to properly interpolate variables whose names
include the same characters as variable markers in Template text strings.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such
as plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string), or
YAML files, or XML files.

* Add a new test suite.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response
to user requests.
