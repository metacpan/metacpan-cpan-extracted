NAME
    RT-Extension-Assets-AppleGSX - Apple GSX for RT Assets

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module; this will
        create several custom fields for assets. If you already have custom
        fields for serial numbers and warantee information, this step is
        unnecessary.

        Running "make initdb" twice will cause duplicate custom fields.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::Assets::AppleGSX));

        or add "RT::Extension::Assets::AppleGSX" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Add additional configuration options
        You must configure the authentication information used to connect to
        GSX via the web UI, at Tools -> Configuration -> Assets -> Apple
        GSX. This menu option is only available to SuperUsers.

        Additionally, if you are not using the supplied custom fields, you
        may wish to Set one or more of the following in your
        RT_SiteConfig.pm (their defaults are shown):

            # Name of custom field containing serial number
            Set( $AppleGSXSerialCF => "Serial Number" )

            # CFs to import from GSX, and their names there
            Set( %AppleGSXMap,
                'Warranty Status'     => 'warrantyStatus',
                'Warranty Start Date' => 'coverageStartDate',
                'Warranty End Date'   => 'coverageEndDate',
            );

            # Only attempt to import data from GSX for assets matching the
            # following CF values:
            Set( %AppleGSXChecks,
                'Trademark' => qr/\bApple(Care)?\b/i,
            );

    Run
    /opt/rt4-assets/local/plugins/RT-Extension-Assets-AppleGSX/bin/rt-apple-
    gsx-set-warranty
        You will likely wish to configure this script to run regularly, via
        a cron job.
