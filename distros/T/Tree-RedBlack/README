Introduction
------------

Tree::RedBlack is a pure perl implementation of the Red/Black balanced tree
algorithm from the book "Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson & Rivest.  It
supports insertion, searching, finding minima, maxima, predecessors and
successors, and deletion (deletion definitely has bugs right now).  Each node
in the tree consists of a key and a value.  Both can be any Perl scalar, even a
complex structure.  By default, keys in the tree are ordered lexically, but the
ordering can be overriden by providing the tree with a comparison subroutine.

Installation
------------

Installation follows the normal module installation procedure:

1. Uncompress and untar the distribution
2. In the root of the distribution, execute
	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install

(sorry, no test suite yet)
