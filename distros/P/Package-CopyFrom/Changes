0.003   2020-02-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Mention Perinci::Package::CopyFrom.


0.002   2020-02-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [incompatible change] Remove option 'overwrite' because the default
	  overwrite=0 behavior is very fragile (copying will depend on whether
	  user mentions the target variable or not). We now always overwrite,
	  and to make sure we modify subroutines/variables after copying,
	  perform copy_from in BEGIN then declare your subroutines/variables
	  afterwards.

	- Add option 'to'.

	- [internal] Add (undocumented) hook options for internal purposes:
	  _on_skip, _before_copy, _after_copy.

        - [bugfix] Forgot to implement skip_sub.

        - [bugfix] Forgot to skip subpackages.

        - [test] Rewrite/add tests.
