NAME

    Test::Version - Check to see that version's in modules are sane

VERSION

    version 2.09

SYNOPSIS

      use Test::More;
      use Test::Version 1.001001 qw( version_all_ok ), {
          is_strict   => 0,
          has_version => 1,
          consistent  => 1,
        };
    
      # test blib or lib by default
      version_all_ok();
    
      done_testing;

DESCRIPTION

    This module's goal is to be a one stop shop for checking to see that
    your versions across your dist are sane. Please ensure that you use
    version 0.04 or later only, as earlier versions are old code and may
    not work correctly. Current feature list:

    module has a version

      Tests to insure that all modules checked have a VERSION defined, Can
      replace Test::HasVersion

    module has a valid version

      Tests to insure that all versions are valid, according to the rules
      of version method is_lax. To quote:

      The lax criteria corresponds to what is currently allowed by the
      version parser. All of the following formats are acceptable for
      dotted-decimal formats strings:

        v1.2
        1.2345.6
        v1.23_4
        1.2345
        1.2345_01

      If you want to limit yourself to a much more narrow definition of
      what a version string constitutes, is_strict() is limited to version
      strings like the following list:

        v1.234.5
        2.3456

      you can cause your tests to fail if not strict by setting is_strict
      to 1

FUNCTIONS

 version_ok

      version_ok( $filename, [ $name ] );

    Test a single .pm file by passing a path to the function. Checks if the
    module has a version, and that it is valid with is_lax.

 version_all_ok

      version_all_ok( [ $directory, [ $name ]] );

    Test all modules in a directory with version_ok. By default it will
    check blib or lib if you haven't passed it a directory.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

 has_version

      use Test::Version qw( version_all_ok ), { has_version => 0 };

    Allows disabling whether a module has to have a version. If set to 0
    version tests will be skipped in any module where no version is found.

    really doesn't make sense to use with just version_ok

 is_strict

      use Test::Version { is_strict => 1 };

    this allows enabling of versions is_strict checks to ensure that your
    version is strict.

 consistent

      use Test::Version { consistent => 1 };

    Check if every module has the same version number.

 ignore_unindexable

      use Test::Version { ignore_unindexable => 0};

    if you have at least Module::Metadata v1.000020 Test::Version will by
    default skip any files not considered is_indexable

 filename_match

      use Test::Version 2.0 { filename_match => [qr{Foo/Bar.pm$}] };

    Only test files that match the given pattern. Pattern may be a list of
    strings, regular expressions or code references. The filename will
    match if it matches one or more patterns.

    string

      The file matches if it matches the pattern string exactly.

    regular expression

      The file matches if it matches the regular expression.

    code reference

      The file matches if the code reference returns a true value. The
      filename is passed in as the only argument to the code reference.

 multiple

      use Test::Version 2.02 { multiple => 1 };

    Test each version for each package if multiple packages are found in a
    file.

SEE ALSO

    The goal is to have the functionality of all of these.

    Test::HasVersion

    Test::ConsistentVersion

    Test::GreaterVersion

    If you are using Dist::Zilla there is a plugin

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Version
