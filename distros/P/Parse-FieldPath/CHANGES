    * Added Parse::FieldPath::Role
    * Support for arrays. "array_field/subfield" returns "subfield" from every
      object in array.
    * Extract data from hashrefs, instead of just objects.

    * Bug fix. The method to get the full list of available fields was
      documented as all_fields(), but implemented as field_list(). Going with
      all_fields().

    * Pre-compile the parser for a speed improvement
    * Made build_tree private (seems sorta useless to anyone else)
    * Added some support for "a/*" syntax. "a/*/b" still doesn't work
    * Call all_fields() on the object to know the valid fields, and which
      fields to return if a whole object is requested.
    * Follow a recursive structure up to 512 times, but no more.
    * Call requested_fields() (if possible) before calling any accessors on an
      object
    * Make an empty field_path argument return everything.

    * First release
    * Parser is mostly working
    * Major portions of the syntax are unimplemented
