Locale-TextDomain-OO folder example
===================================

This is the explanation which file shows what.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This examples shows you the flexibility how to use different lexicons and
translation methods. So you can run maketext and/or gettext methods in a mix
you want.

The module itself is not touching your machine locale. It is not reading any
locale information of a request or from the operating system. You decide what
you really want.

You are able to bind this module to a perl script and also to a web framework
e.g. Catalyst. Both I do with that module in a productive system. Before
Locale::Maketext was used there. After context problems and plural problems
we changed the used module and step by step the methods we call.

Context problems: This are something like the word "date". You have one word in
the English language and 2 German translations for that. The first is "Datum"
in the datetime context. The second is "Date" for the appointment context.

Plural problems: The plural of the text "There is 1 attachment." is "There are
2 attachments". The Locale::Maketext workaround was "There is/are 1
attachment." and "There is/are 2 attachments.".

02_filter.pl
    This example shows how to run code after each translation.
    Maybe you want to run any formatter like markdown or and/or encode to UTF-8
    or anything else.

03_language_of_languages.pl
    This example shows how to use the plugin "Language::LanguageOfLanguages".
    This plugin implements the method languages. You can give a lot of
    languages. The first match in lexicon will store that language as the used
    language. If no of that languages is availabe in lexicon that will use
    language "i-default". Maybe you have to blow up that with super and panic
    languages but that depends on your project.

04_lexicon_store_JSON_utf-8.pl
    This example shows how to use the lexicon as JSON for JavaScript. Because
    not the full lexicon is used in JavaScript, you can set the filter.

05_expand_gettext_modifier.pl
    This example shows how to format numbers.

06_expand_maketext_formatter_code.pl
   This example shows how to format numbers.

11_gettext_hash.pl, 11_gettext_loc_hash.pl, 11_gettext_named_hash.pl
    This example shows how to create a lexicon from hash.
    And it shows how to run with the different gettext plugins.

12_gettext_mo_utf-8.pl
    This example shows how to create a lexicon from mo file.
    Also that is using Russian language with 3 plural forms.
    It also shows how to work with grammar attributes.

13_gettext_mo_cp1252.pl
    It is also possible to read the mo file with Windows charset cp1252.

14_N__.pl, 14_Nloc_.t
    This example shows how to use all the N__... or Nloc_... methods.
    This methods are seen by extractor but doing no translation.
    Maybe there is a mapping and only one translation is used at the end.
    So translate only that one and not all.

17_multiplural_mo_utf-8.pl
    This shows how to use more than one plural form in one phrase. That is a
    special thing but a possible way.

21_maketext_mo_utf-8.pl
    Also the maketext method is callable. Here you can see, what to do.

22_loc_mo_style_gettext.pl
    Sometime the maketext method is written as method loc.
    That example also shows the getext writing %1 instead of _1.

23_localize_mo_utf-8.pl
    Sometime the maketext method is written as method localize.

41_tied_interface.pl
    To interpolate all methods inside of a string use the tied stuff.

42_gettext_mo_functional_interface.pl
    There is also a functional Interface.
    Create the object and bind that to the interface.
