# Set-Tiny

`Set::Tiny` is a thin wrapper around regular Perl hashes to perform often needed
set operations, such as testing two sets of strings for equality, or checking
whether one is contained within the other.

## Installation

The best way to install this module is to use `cpan` or `cpanm`:

```
cpanm install Set::Tiny
```

Since `Set::Tiny` is available at [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/).

Another option is to use your package manager (if the module is available).

As a last resource (not recommended) you can download the tarball, unpackt it
and run the following commands:

```
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

## Support and documentation
