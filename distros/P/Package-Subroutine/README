Readme for module Package-Subroutine
------------------------------------

This is a collection of subroutines to work with
subroutines and packages. It is a very simple wrapper
around the perl syntax for doing that to improve readabilty
of the code.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install


This module contains as syntactic sugar the 'from' package.
This module targets not library development and should only be used
for in house projects.
