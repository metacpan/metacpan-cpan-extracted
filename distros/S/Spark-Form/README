NAME
    Spark::Form - A simple yet powerful forms validation system that
    promotes reuse.

VERSION
    version 0.2102

SYNOPSIS
     use Spark::Form;
     use CGI; #Because it makes for a quick and oversimplistic example
     use Third::Party::Field;
     $form = Spark::Form->new(plugin_ns => 'MyApp::Field');
     # Add a couple of inbuilt modules
     $form->add('email','email',confirm_field => 'email-confirm')
          ->add('email','email-confirm')
          ->add('password','password',regex => qr/^\S{6,}$/),
          #This one will be autoloaded from MyApp::Field::Username
          ->add('username','username')
          # And this shows how you can use a third party field of any class name
          ->add(Third::Party::Field->new(name => 'blah'));
     #Pass in a HashRef of params to populate the virtual form with data
     $form->data(CGI->new->params);
     #And do the actual validation
     if ($form->validate) {
         print "You are now registered";
     } else {
         print join "\n", $form->errors;
     }

    and over in MyApp/Field/Username.pm...

     package MyApp::Form::Field::Username;
     use base Spark::Form::Field;

     sub _validate {

       my ($self,$v) = @_;

       if (length $v < 6 or length $v > 12) {
         $self->error("Usernames must be 6-12 characters long");
       } elsif ($v =~ /[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]/) {
         $self->error("Usernames may contain only a-z,A-Z,0-9, _ and -");
       } else {
         $self->error(undef);
       }
       $self->valid(!!$self->error());
     }

INSTABILITY
    Periodically the API may break. I'll try to make sure it's obvious so it
    doesn't silently malfunction.

    By 0.5, we shouldn't have to do this.

DEPENDENCIES
    Moose. I've dropped using Any::Moose. If you need the performance
    increase, perhaps it's time to start thinking about shifting off CGI.

METHODS
  import (%options)
    Allows you to set some options for the forms class.

    class => String
        Optional, gives the basename for searching for form plugins.

        Given 'MyApp', it will try to load form plugins from
        MyApp::Form::Field::*

    source => String
        Optional, names a plugin to try and extract form data from.

        If unspecified, you will need to call $form->data(\%data);

  add ($thing,@rest)
    If $thing is a string, attempts to instantiate a plugin of that type and
    add it to the form. Requires the second argument to be a string name for
    the field to identify it in the form. Rest will become %kwargs If it is
    an ArrayRef, it loops over the contents (Useful for custom fields, will
    probably result in bugs for string field names).@rest will be passed in
    each iteration. If it looks sufficiently like a field (implements
    Spark::Form::Field), then it will add it to the list of fields. @rest
    will just become %kwargs

    Uses 'field name' to locate it from the data passed in.

    This is a streaming interface, it returns the form itself.

  validate
    Validates the form. Sets "valid" and then also returns the value.

  data
    Allows you to pass in a HashRef of data to populate the fields with
    before validation. Useful if you don't use a plugin to automatically
    populate the data.

    This is a streaming interface, it returns the form itself.

  fields () => Fields
    Returns a list of Fields in the form in their current order

  BUILD
    Moose constructor. Test::Pod::Coverage made me do it. Adds "class" to
    the search path for field modules.

  get (Str)
    Returns the form field of that name

  get_at (Int)
    Returns the form field at that index (counting from 0)

  keys () :: Array
    Returns the field names

  field_couplet () :: Data::Couplet
    Returns the Data::Couplet used to store the fields. Try not to use this
    too much.

  remove (Array[Str]) :: Spark::Form
    Removes the field(s) bearing the given name(s) from the form object.
    Silently no-ops any that do not exist.

  remove_at (Array[Int]) :: Spark::Form
    Removes the field at the given ID(s) from the form object. Silently
    no-ops any that do not exist.

    WARNING: Things will get re-ordered when you do this. If you have a form
    with IDs 0..3 and you remove (1, 3), then (0, 2) will remain but they
    will now be (0, 1) as Data::Couplet will move them to keep a consistent
    array.

  clone_all () :: Spark::Form
    Returns a new copy of the form with freshly instantiated fields.

  clone_except_names (Array[Str]) :: Spark::Form
    Clones, removing the fields with the specified names.

  clone_only_names (Array[Str]) :: Spark::Form
    Clones, removing the fields without the specified names.

  clone_except_ids (Array[Int]) :: Spark::Form
    Clones, removing the fields with the specified IDs.

  clone_only_ids (Array[Int]) :: Spark::Form
    Clones, removing the fields without the specified IDs.

  clone_if (SubRef[(Int, Str, Any) -> Bool]) :: Spark::Form
    Clones, removing items for which the sub returns false. Sub is passed
    (Id, Key, Value).

  clone_unless (SubRef[(Int, Str, Any) -> Bool]) :: Spark::Form
    Clones, removing items for which the sub returns true. Sub is passed
    (Id, Key, Value).

  compose (Spark::Form) :: Spark::Form
    Clones the current form object and copies fields from the supplied other
    form to the end of that form. Where names clash, items on the current
    form take priority.
