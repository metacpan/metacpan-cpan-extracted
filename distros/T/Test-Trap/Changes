Revision history for Test-Trap

0.3.5	Wed 27 Jul 2022 05:58:02 AM CEST
        No changes to the libraries, just to the tests.  Perl best
        practices form a moving target.
        - Stop using bareword filehandles; if it isn't deprecated
          already, it will be.
        - RT #143716: Perl pulled the rug from under me on untainting
          environment variables when it stopped treating an empty
          string as a safe PATH.  Fix by deleting the offending
          environment variables instead, as suggested by Graham Knop.

0.3.4	Sun Oct 14 20:39:41 CEST 2018
	For this release, many thanks go to Todd Rinaldo, who found
        that my fix for the $^E clobbering wound up clobbering $! in
        every basic test.
        - Declared some required and optional dependencies.
        - RT #127112 is addressed, using the patch from TODDR@cpan.org
          augmented wtih a comment.
        - A regression test has been added for this. 

0.3.3   Tue Aug 22 02:06:09 CEST 2017
	For this release, many thanks go to Slaven Rezic, who found
        that Test::More::is() (or Test2::Formatter::TAP::write())
        clobbers $^E on Windows.
        - RT #105125 is addressed:  The tests now use a copy of $^E
          taken before Test::More gets a chance to touch it.
	- Further, the Test::Trap test methods might also clobber $^E
          (via Test::More or other modules), so they now localize $^E
          before invoking the callback.
        - Regression tests have been added for this.

0.3.2	Tue Feb 24 00:19:23 CET 2015
        The tempfile-preserve strategy was (always) broken on
        non-perlio perls.
        Also, some of the tests were (recently) noisy on old perls.
        Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile:
        - add a GOTPERLIO guard to each IO_LAYERS block.
        Tests:
        - 03-files.pl now avoid "used only once" warnings.

0.3.1	Mon Feb 23 21:43:30 CET 2015
	This release doesn't touch library code, but addresses some
	test issues:
        - It fixes RT #102271 by checking for the presence of a
	  utf8-layer on the original STDOUT, instead of assuming its
	  absence.
        - It makes some test code cleaner.
        - It silences redefine warnings during testing on certain
	  platforms.
        Library files: No change but version bump.
        Tests:
        - 03-files* now use another global to specify the class to
          require, replacing a quick-and-dirty hack that turned out to
          be noisy on some platforms, including Cygwin.
        - {15-tempfile,16-systemsafe}-options.t now check for the
          presence of utf8-layer on STDOUT, instead of assuming its
          absence.  (Either of the environment variables PERL_UNICODE
          and PERL5OPT could cause such a layer to be present, and
          there might be other ways to do it.)

0.3.0	Thu Dec 18 21:57:51 CET 2014
	This release, in brief:
        - improves clarity through nomenclature:
              * renames "(output layer) backend implementation" to
                "(capture) strategy", for more standard nomenclature
                (and less of a mouthful);
              * renames "pseudo-layer" to "multi-layer" (if so
                declared) or "non-trapping layer" (neither is a direct
                analogue to PerlIO pseudo layers, so the nomenclature
                was misleading);
        - adds (import) options to the TempFile and SystemSafe capture
	  strategy factories, allowing for different ways to handle
	  PerlIO layers;
        - using these for two new standard capture strategies,
          "tempfile-preserve" and "systemsafe-preserve"; and
        - fixes a bug in SystemSafe.
        And, in more detail ...
        Test::Trap::Builder:
        - Changes method names per the nomenclature changes, leaving
          back-compat aliases behind.
        - Changes error message per the nomenclature changes.  (No
          back-compat possible, sorry.)
        - Updates the documentation.
        Test::Trap::Builder::{TempFile,SystemSafe}:
        - Import now takes arguments:
		strategy name (default {"tempfile","systemsafe"}); and
                strategy options (default empty hash).
        - The following options are supported:
		preserve_io_layers (boolean; default false); and
        	io_layers (colon-separated string; default unset).
        Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
        - Fixes a bug where the original perlio layers were not
	  restored after the trap was sprung.
        Test::Trap::Builder::{PerlIO,TempFile,SystemSafe}:
        - Updates the code in accordance with Test::Trap::Builder
          changes; see above.
        - Updates the documentation.
        Test::Trap:
        - Imports new capture strategy, "tempfile-preserve", from
          TempFile with option preserve_io_layers.
        - Imports new capture strategy, "systemsafe-preserve", from
          SystemSafe with option preserve_io_layers.
        - Updates the code in accordance with Test::Trap::Builder
          changes; see above.
        - Updates the documentation.
        Tests:
        - changes variable names and comments in accordance with
          nomenclature changes;
        - adds tests for the no-restore bug in t/03-files.pl (hence
          for each tested strategy);
        - adds t/03-files-{tempfile,systemsafe}-preserve.t to run the
          basic tests against the new capture strategies;
        - accounts for the changed error message in t/06-layers.t;
        - adds t/{15-tempfile,16-systemsafe}-options.t to check
          capture strategies of varying options.

0.2.5	Sun Nov 16 18:31:42 CET 2014
	This release localizes $! (ERRNO) for internal operations that
	change it, as suggested by Felipe Gasper.  For the same
	operations, it also localizes $^E (extended OS error).
        Library files:
        - Localize $! and $^E for internal operations that change them.
        Tests:
        - Check that bare test blocks leave $!, %!, and $^E unchanged,
          but that blocks that modify $! and $^E still do so.
        Also:
        - Added Module::Build to the configure_requires.
        - Fix emacs mode line on t/14-leaks.t.
        - Better comments in lib/Test/Trap/Builder.pm.

0.2.4	Sun Mar 30 10:02:16 CEST 2014
	This release fixes a memory leak with the default tempfile
	backend layer implementation for trapping output.  The
	systemsafe alternative backend had the same kind of leak, and
	has also been fixed.  (The perlio alternative backend was not
	affected.)
        Thanks go again to Felipe Gasper for discovering this!
        Test::Trap::Builder:
        - Add a method ExceptionFunction to make it easier to avoid
          circular references arising from registered closures.
          Document and export this method.
        Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile:
        - Break a circular reference chain.
        Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
        - Break a similar but slightly more complicated circular
          reference chain.
        Tests:
        - Added t/14-leaks.t to check that the reference count is as
          expected, at least with trivial code and standard setup for
          all three output layer backends.
        Also:
        - Use ebhanssen@cpan.org for my email address.
        - Update copyright years.
        - Update MANIFEST.SKIP &c for use of git (goodbye subversion).

0.2.3   Mon Dec 30 14:46:15 CET 2013
        Library files:
        - RT #87263: typo fixes, courtesy dsteinbrunner@pobox.com.
        - Localize the trap coderef, so that it does not hold on to
          what it closes over, creating stale references, but lets
          them go out of scope; thanks go to Felipe Gasper.
        Documentation:
        - Some clarification for RT #91687: Wrong exit code after die.
        Tests:
        - Regression test for the stale references.

0.2.2	Fri Mar  2 02:23:04 CET 2012
        Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile & Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
        - RT #61776: Remove temporary files at first opportunity;
          thanks go to Ian Goodacre.
        Documentation:
        - RT #61773: return from trap function
          Document what trap { ... } returns.
        Tests:
        - RT #75430: Failing tests in 06-layer.t
          Convert a number of die_is to die_like, handling cases with
          and without trailing comma from carp.
        - Unset another taint-checked environment variable, CDPATH;
          thanks go to CPAN testers.

0.2.1	Tue Dec 29 23:14:45 CET 2009
	Documentation:
	 - fix a typo, [RT #48941]; thanks go to David Taylor;
	Tests:
	 - use .PL-files to build the test files t/08-fork.t and
           t/11-systemsafe-basic.t instead of dispatching through
           *-taint.t and *-no-taint.t files at runtime;
	Build:
	 - setup the build of the above test files in Build.PL;
	 - add a ACTION_distmeta override to check for patch to or
           version of Module::Build::Compat with correct handling of
           PL_FILES/PL_files;
	 - update the MANIFEST and .SKIP files accordingly.

0.2.0	Tue Sep 30 04:28:30 CEST 2008
	Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
	 - add explicit close()s, as it seems various files otherwise
           remain open for too long;
	 - register the teardown sub as soon as we have a tempfile, so
           that we'll close it in teardown even if internal exceptions
           are raised;
	Test::Trap::Builder::Tempfile:
	 - added an explicit close($fh), as it seems it otherwise
           remains open for too long;
	 - register the teardown sub as soon as we have a tempfile, so
           that we'll close it in teardown even if internal exceptions
           are raised;
	Test::Trap::Builder:
	 - add an ' id ' member to the object, for use with tag-on
           properties, as the ref stringification does not survive a
           pseudo-fork (inside-out objects are *hard*);
	 - make sure all registered teardowns are called, even after
           one or more internal exceptions;
	Test::Trap:
	 - use a different workaround (by way of Teardown) for
           $SIG{__WARN__} temporary value, as it seems local %SIG does
           not restore the previous value or lack thereof upon scope
           exit (may perlbug that one);
	Tests:
	 - add a regression test for $SIG{__WARN__} restoration to
           t/03-files.pl;
	 - add a regression test for the ", <$fh> line 1." bug to
           t/03-files.pl;
	 - t/03-files.pl and t/06-layers.t: add necessary close()s and
           local *FH to make sure all files are closed before exiting
           (as otherwise, tempfiles are not being cleaned on windows);
	 - added "~" to the characters accepted in the $^X path, for
           t/11-systemsafe-basic.pl;
	 - reorganize: move "unnumbered" tests to xt/author;
	Build:
	 - bump the minor version number, in response to the internal
           changes in Test::Trap::Builder;
	 - don't list Config as a prereq, as that seems to mess up
           CPANPLUS(?) installations;
	 - updated MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP, and Build.PL (adding
           ACTION_authortest) in accordance with the above test
           reorganization.

0.1.2	Fri Sep 12 17:30:42 CEST 2008
	Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile:
	 - use *$globref, not $globref directly -- I have no idea why
           this suddenly broke, but it did;
	Tests:
	 - make t/10-tester.t independent of the exact format of the
           Test::More diagnostics -- just dependent on it staying the
           same within one process;
	    - thanks go to Andreas Koenig, cpantesters, and Michael
              Schwern for providing early warning that this was going
              to fail!
	 - make t/03-files.pl use backticks (`) instead of null chars
           (\0) as a warning record separator -- makeshift fix --
           I should do better, but this must do for now;
	Build:
	 - up the perl dependency to 5.6.2 -- 5.6.0/5.6.1 may be
           salvageable, but do not seem worth it.

0.1.1	Tue Mar 11 20:08:31 CET 2008
	Documentation:
	 - document the indexing/slicing of ->return and ->warn;
	 - smaller tweaks;
	 - new methods *_isa_ok;
	Test::Trap:
	 - usage patterns clearly indicate we need *_isa_ok tests: a
	   $trap->did_return w/BAIL_OUT followed by an
	   isa_ok($trap->return(0)) w/BAIL_OUT must constitute the
	   clearest test-trap anti-pattern since C<() = trap {...}>;
	 - note: *_can_ok is still out, since it does not take any
	   kind of name, and the TTB interface still expects a name;
	Tests:
	 - subclass Pod::Coverage so that it treats the functions
	   "imported" from Test::Trap::Builder as though they were
	   native, not imported, to the package we're testing;
	 - update t/pod-coverage.t to ignore the latest methods and
	   functions somehow documented: layer:*, *_isa_ok, Next,
	   Prop, Run, etc;
	 - prevent t/99-coverage.t exiting with code 8 on success, now
	   that Test-Simple actually catches that stuff;
	Build:
	 - up the Test::Tester dependency to 0.107 -- I don't know
	   what broke t/10-tester.t; I don't think it was anything of
	   mine -- but upgrading Test::Tester fixed it.

0.1.0	Mon Jan 14 18:31:09 CET 2008
	Overall:
	 - Continuing to fix small stuff, but also beginning to mess
	   with the interfaces, adding new stuff and rewriting most of
	   the builder.
	 - Applied a patch from Michael Schilli (in response to a bug
	   reported by Kimo Rosenbaum) adding UNLINK => 1 to the
	   arguments for File::Temp::tempfile().  (Duh!)
	Documentation:
	 - revised section on TTB exports;
	 - revised section on TTB methods;
	 - document the new pseudo-layers;
	Nomenclature:
	 - s/trapper layer/trap layer/g;
	 - s/trap (module|package)/trapper/g;	# (and similar)
	 - s/result object/trap object/g;	# consistency
	 - s/object/trap/g;			# argspec ~~ clarity
	 - s/all/entirety/g;			# argspec ~~ s/adjective/noun/
	 - s/indexed/element/g;			# argspec ~~ s/adjective/noun/
	 - ... but keep backwards compatibility with the previous argspec,
	       for now (just don't advertise it in the docs);
	Test::Trap::Builder:
	 - clean up the test method generation code;
	 - clean up the accessor method generation code;
	 - clean up the layer registration code;
	 - pass the args string to the simple layers;
	 - new export method: Prop, returning a hash for tag-on properies;
	 - new export method: DESTROY, cleaning up tag-on properties;
	 - new export method: TestFailure, running on_test_failure tag-on;
	 - new export method: TestAccessor, returning test_accessor tag-on;
	 - pull out members test and accessor, as these are conceptually
	   (private) trapper class state, not builder instance members;
	 - pull out member output_layer_backend, as this is
	   conceptually (private) builder class state, not a builder
	   instance member;
	 - turn members _code, _layers, _teardown, _test_accessor, and
	   _exception, (all without the leading underscore) into tag-on
	   properties, rather than pollute the trap object;
	 - get rid of more trap object pollution: __exception;
	 - in test callback argspecs, refer to trap objects as "trap",
	   not "object";
	 - better handling of exceptions in layers and teardown.
	Test::Trap:
	 - run the test failure callback from the quiet() test;
	 - new utility method: diag_all, basically {diag dump $self};
	 - new utility method: diag_all_once, a "smarter" version.
	 - new (non-default) pseudo-layers:
	    :void      - user code is trapped in void context
	    :scalar    - user code is trapped in scalar context
	    :list      - user code is trapped in list context
	    :on_fail() - method name for test failures callback
	Tests:
	 - full coverage for the new methods and exception handling;
	 - t/00-load.t does BAIL_OUT if Test::Trap cannot be used;
	 - t/07-subclass.t no longer needs to test the case of the empty 
	   default_output_layer_backends(), since this has now been
	   removed from the extension interface;
	 - t/06-layers.t cleaned up and expanded to cover the new layers; except
	 - t/10-tester.t covers the :on_fail() layer;
	 - t/10-tester.t now tests a simple non-leaveby accessor too;
	 - t/11-systemsafe-basic.pl now actually prints diagnostics when the
	   system() call fails.  Duh!  (I still don't know why some Cygwin
	   setups fails these tests, but I'd sure like to.)

0.0.23	Mon Jun 25 22:47:50 CEST 2007
	More blead stuff; otherwise just making a convenient small-stuff cut.
	Test::Trap:
	 - Don't use IO::Handle here.  (Only needed with File::Temp.)
	Test::Trap::Builder::PerlIO:
	 - Don't need ->autoflush, nor IO::Handle.
	Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile:
	 - Need IO::Handle, so use it.
	Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
	 - Need IO::Handle, so use it.
	 - The strange buffering bug seems to have disappeared
           (between revisions 99 and 100), though I have no idea how.
	   This ought to mean I no longer need to maintain the clumsy
	   work-around.  So, removed!
	Tests:
	 - As a concession to the CPANTS game, reinstated the pod tests.  :)
	 - The regression test for the workaround for the pseudo-fork
	   bug was broken.  Fixed by using the (implicit) :default
	   layer in t/08-fork.pl.
	 - t/02-reentrant.t caused a warning under bleed.  Fixed.
	 - t/03-files.pl is now blead-ready (warning texts changed).
	 - t/11-systemsafe-basic.pl now detects system() failure and
	   fails the relevant tests as well (thank you cpan testsers).

0.0.22	Sun May 20 23:21:36 CEST 2007
	No big changes this time.
	Cleanup:
	 - remove unused Getopt::Long from tests;
	 - rearrange some tests for better readability;
	 - rewrite some systemsafe pod for better readability.
	Tests:
	 - delete $ENV{ENV} (tainted);
	 - for coverage, first don't use Test::More in t/99-coverage.t;
	 - for coverage, test the internals of exiting breaking badly;
	 - simpler (and better covering) subclass tests.
	Test::Trap:
	 - don't AUTOLOAD on behalf of Test::More after all (unclean);
	 - last TEST_TRAP_EXITING rather than goto EXITING (avoid collisions).
	Test::Trap::Builder:
	 - localize the builder's internals of the trap object, so
	   that they are gone as soon as the trap has sprung, leaving
	   pay data only;
	 - last TEST_TRAP_BUILDER_INTERNAL_EXCEPTION rather than
	   goto INTERNAL_EXCEPTION (avoid collision);
	 - note (in the pod) a caveat for diamond inheritance wrt
	   autogeneration of test methods.
	Build:
	 - don't include author's tests (pod*, kwalitee, etc) in the tarball;
	 - note _all_ mandatory module dependencies (overkill?).

0.0.21	Sun Oct 29 15:53:07 CET 2006
	Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe:
	 - Fix typo in the NAME section of the POD.
	Test::Trap::Builder:
	 - Export a method ->TestAccessor, giving the tested accessor's name.
	 - Remove (ugly) register method ->test_method.
	 - Add (cleaner) register method ->test.
	Test::Trap:
	 - Better diagnostics to failing *_ok/*_nok test.
	 - AUTOLOAD Test::More when required.

0.0.20	Sun Oct 22 09:21:55 CEST 2006
	Test::Trap::Builder:
	 - Backend implementations are now methods, almost layers, not functions.
	    - Called with the (layer) name, the fileno, and the globref.
	    - local(*$globref) is now left to the implementation.
	 - Add method ->trap, implementing trap entry.
	 - Add exportable methods Run, Next, Exception, Teardown:
	    - Run runs the user's code;
	    - Next continues to the next layer;
	    - Exception raises an internal exception;
	    - Teardown registers cleanup code.
	Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile, Test::Trap::Builder::PerlIO:
	 - Use ->Teardown instead of &DESTROY.
	Add Test::Trap::Builder::SystemSafe.
	 - Add three test scripts for this.
	 - Work hard, and make those tests pass on 5.6.2!  :-)
	t/03-files.pl: Simpler, less hacky, choice of backend.
	t/07-subclass.t: Use the core alarm(), not the Time::HiRes one.
	t/08-fork.t: Remember to wait() on all children.
	t/99-coverage.t: What I cannot test without hacking.
	t/*{-no-,-}taint.t:
	 - Since Windows fork() does not work with taint mode.
	t/*.t, t/*.pl:
	 - Add comments and refactor into subroutines.
	 - Replace pass()/fail() with simpler/clearer ok().

0.0.19	Wed Sep 27 20:48:20 CEST 2006
	No new functionality -- just bugfixes!
	Address three portability issues:
	 - added binmode to the second handle on the tempfile;
	 - skip timout tests if Time::HiRes::ualarm cannot be imported;
	 - todo & skip the fork test on windows;
	 - thanks go to Alexandr Ciornii for reporting these failures!
	Also:
	 - document the fork() issue on Windows as a Test::Trap bug;
	 - just skip the fork tests on platforms without fork;
	 - drop the Time::HiRes dependency (we only need it for a test);
	 - a little more POD and code (readability) cleanup.

0.0.18	Mon Sep 25 23:49:48 CEST 2006
	Basically just pushing to get a well-packaged version out.
	Packaged with a newer MB to get a (hopefully) better META.yml.
	Cleaned up the error messages somewhat.

0.0.17	Sat Sep 23 00:47:13 CEST 2006
	Overview:
	 - Test::Temp gets new optional layers:
		:stdout(perlio)
		:stdout(tempfile)
		:stderr(perlio)
		:stderr(tempfile)
	 - Test::Temp interface is otherwise unchanged.
	 - Test::Trap::Builder interface is mostly unchanged, but now:
	    - treats braces in layer names as syntactical;
	    - has an interface for registering output layer backends;
	    - also lets you register default backends;

	Update the tests to cover both backends.
	Skip the PerlIO backend tests if PerlIO is not availible.
	For whatever reason, make noisy ugly META.yml after upgrades.

0.0.15	Mon Sep 18 23:53:05 CEST 2006
	Move the extension interface into its own Test::Trap::Builder.
	Change the extension interface somewhat:
	  - methods on the builder object, not the calling package;
	  - simpler methods for making accessors;
	  - methods also for registering test method prototypes;
	  - generate test methods from accessor + test pairs;
	  - ... even if the test or accessor is inherited;
	  - &layer_implementation needs both $module and $Builder now;
	  - update the tests accordingly.
	Also, added some new tests for the builder.

0.0.14	Tue Sep  5 16:40:13 CEST 2006
	Rewrite the "layer:$name" methods:
	  - return the layer implementation rather than be it, and

	  - changing &layer, &layer_implementation, and &multi_layer.
	Update the POD accordingly.
	Add an example using the extension interface.
	Polish the POD, and add some more vertical spacing.

	Document these.
	Test them -- using Test::Tester.

0.0.12	Sun Aug 27 03:05:45 CEST 2006
	Don't trap exits in children!  Revert to outer exit-handler instead.
	Test undefined *CORE::GLOBAL::exit.
