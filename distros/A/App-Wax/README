NAME
----

wax - webify your CLI

SYNOPSIS
--------

    wax [OPTIONS] program [OPTIONS] ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

wax is a command-line program which runs other command-line programs and
converts their URL arguments to local file paths. By default, the files are
removed after the command has exited.

As well as adding transparent support for remote resources to commands
that don't support them natively, wax can be used to:

-   add support for HTTPS (and any other protocols supported by LWP) to
    programs that only support HTTP
-   add a mirroring layer to network requests (remote resources are only
    fetched if they've been updated)
-   add a caching layer to network requests (remote resources are only
    fetched once)

For more details, see the wax man page.
