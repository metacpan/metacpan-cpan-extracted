NAME

XML::RelaxNG::Compact::PXB

VERSION

  0.15

DESCRIPTION

 Those who are looking into the XML data binding framework may benefit from
 this module. Especially those people who tired of refactoring their XML/XPath
 code every time their namespace change or some part of their schema have changed.
 Ok, I lied. 
 It binds  RelaxNG Compact schema [http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html] but I will use XML term
 since there are several very easy ways to translate your XML schema into the RNGC and
 most modern open source schema developments are centered on RNGC rather than XML).
  
 This is XML RelaxNG compact data  binding framework. For any RelaxNG compact schema
 represented as perl data structures it will create the tree of perl classes.
 Basicaly it binds every element from the XML (RelaxNG compact) schema
 into corresponded perl object. It uses XML::LibXML for actual XML document parsing where
 validation is provided by the API unmarshalling process. It supports namspaces, of course.
 It automatically creates helper modules and test suit as well.
 The syntax of the data model language allows to include direct mappings
 from the XML schema to SQL database table entries. Please see XML::RelaxNG::Compact::DataModel
 for more information. 
 This module is not pretending to be a YetAnotherOne POE + ORM on steroids.
 It just does what was outlined above. It utilizes Perl::Critic and perltidy to insure that
 it creates uniform, highly supportable and extendable API.

TODO

use LibXML RelaxNG schema parsing abilites to eliminate need for 
perl data structures

Use PPI module from CPAN to create API in more OO cleaner way and provide
better support for users's schema callbacks
