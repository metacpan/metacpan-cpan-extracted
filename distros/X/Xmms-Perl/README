You need xmms installed to use this package: http://www.xmms.org/

This package provides the following modules:

 Xmms::Remote - Perl interface to the xmms_remote API

 Xmms::Config - Perl interface to the xmms_cfg API

 Xmms - Exports the remote control shell routine

 Xmms::Plugin - Embeds a Perl interpreter inside xmms and provides
                Input/Output/Effect/General plugin interfaces for
                Perl (not yet released, may never be)

Jean-Baptiste Nivoit has written an emacs mode to interact with
Xmms::shell, which you can find here:

 http://www.multimania.com/jbn/software/xmms-mode.el

For best results, install the bundle via:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Xmms'

Enjoy,
-Doug
