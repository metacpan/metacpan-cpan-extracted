NAME

    spread-revolutionary-date - Spread date and time from Revolutionary
    (Republican) Calendar

VERSION

    version 0.51

DESCRIPTION

    spread-revolutionary-date is a Free Software
    <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html> that spreads the current
    date, expressed in the French Revolutionary calendar
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar>, to various
    social networks: Mastodon <https://mastodon.social/>, Bluesky
    <https://bsky.app/>, Twitter <https://twitter.com/>, the Liberachat
    <https://libera.chat/> and Freenode <https://freenode.net/> Internet
    Relay Chat networks.

    Moreover, you can easily extend these defaults targets with any desired
    one, see "EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS", and even spread something else
    than the revolutionary date, see "msgmaker" option and "EXTENDING TO
    NEW MESSAGE MAKERS".

    The French Revolutionary calendar, also called Republican calendar, was
    introduced during the French Revolution
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution>, and used from late
    1793 to 1805, and also during the Paris Commune
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune> in 1871. This was an
    attempt to get rid of religious and royalist references found in
    Gregorian calendar when naming measures of Time. Months were given new
    names based on nature, each day of the year, instead of being named
    after an associated saint, had a unique name associated with the rural
    economy: agricultural tools, common animals, grains, pastures, trees,
    roots, flowers, fruits, plants, and minerals. But this was also an
    attempt to give more rational in measuring Time, basing measures on
    decimal system. Instead of weeks, each month was divided into exactly 3
    décades, that is ten days; days were divided into ten hours; hours into
    100 minutes; and minutes into 100 seconds.

    You must have a registered account on each of the targets you want to
    spread the revolutionary date. And you must get credentials for
    spread-revolutionary-date to post on Mastodon, Bluesky and Twitter, and
    also for IA generated messages with Gemini message maker. Finally, you
    have to configure spread-revolutionary-date to use these credentials,
    see "CONFIGURATION" and "COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS" below.

    The revolutionary date and time is computed thanks to the
    DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary Perl module, by Jean Forget.

USAGE

      # Just execute the script in your shell
      # to spread current date to configured accounts
      # to Bluesky, Twitter, Mastodon, Freenode and Liberachat:
      $ spread-revolutionary-date
    
      # Or, since this script does nothing but calling
      # the L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate> Perl module,
      # use this one-liner:
      $ perl -MApp::SpreadRevolutionaryDate \
          -e 'App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate->new->spread;'
    
      # Test spreading to Mastodon only:

CONFIGURATION

    Once again: you have to configure spread-revolutionary-date with
    credentials for registered account on each of the desired targets and
    also for Gemini message maker, so it can spread the revolutionary date
    or an IA generated message on behalf of these accounts.

    Configuration options may also be specified as command line parameters,
    see "COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS" below, which take precedence on options
    of the configuration file.

    The configuration file should lie on
    ~/.config/spread-revolutionary-date/spread-revolutionary-date.conf or
    ~/.spread-revolutionary-date.conf. In case a file is found on both
    paths, the second one is ignored. The configuration file should use the
    popular INI file format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>. A
    sample configuration file can be found in this distribution at
    etc/sample-spread-revolutionary-date.conf.

 General options

    These options should appear outside of any section of the configuration
    file.

  targets

    This option can be specified multiple times, with values as strings. It
    explicitly defines targets where the revolutionary date should be
    spread to. Any value set for this option should be a valid target: any
    of the five default targets (Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, Liberachat, or
    Freenode) or some new target if you have extended this application (see
    "EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS"). If this option is not defined, the
    revolutionary date is spread on all five default targets: Mastodon,
    Bluesky, Twitter, Liberachat, or Freenode.

  msgmaker

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string. Spreads
    a message computed by the class defined by the value of this option,
    defaults to RevolutionaryDate. The Value (case sensitive) of this
    option should correspond to an existing
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::Value class consuming
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker role. Message makers values
    pre-defined in this distribution are RevolutionaryDate, which spreads
    the revolutionary date; PromptUser, which prompts the user for the
    message to be spread (with confirmation); Telechat, which spreads the
    date of the day similar to the Belgian-French TV show 'Téléchat" on the
    1980's; and Gemini which prompts Gemini AI to generate a message. See
    "EXTENDING TO NEW MESSAGE MAKERS" for details on using a new value for
    this option.

  locale

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string. Spreads
    with chosen language. As of App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate 0.11 locale is
    limited to 'fr', 'en', 'it' or 'es' for RevolutionaryDate and 'fr',
    'en', 'it', 'es' or 'de' otherwise. Defaults to 'fr' for
    RevolutionaryDate and Gemini, and to 'en' for <PromptUser>. Locale is
    forced to 'fr' for Telechat since only french-spokers can understand
    the TV show. To add more languages see "INTERNATIONALIZATION AND
    LOCALIZATION".

  test

    This boolean option takes no value, either it is defined or not. If
    defined, do not actually spread the revolutionary date, just print it
    on standard output for Mastodon, Bluesky and Twitter, and send it on
    configured test channels for Liberachat and Freenode (see
    "test_channels" below).

 Mastodon options

    These options are credentials for spread-revolutionary-date to spread
    on a Mastodon account. You have to get them from your Mastodon instance

 RevolutionaryDate options

    These options change the way revolutionary date is computed when
    "msgmaker" option is RevolutionaryDate. They should be defined in the
    [revolutionarydate] section of the configuration file.

  acab

    This boolean option takes no value, either it is defined or not,
    defaults to false. If defined, instead of spreading the current date
    and time, pretend that decimal time is 1:31:20 (which corresponds to
    03:08:56 UTC, 04:08:56 Paris winter time, or 05:08:56 Paris summer
    time, in sexagesimal scale used by common Anglo-Babylonian Time).

  wikipedia_link

    This boolean option takes no value, either it is defined or not,
    defaults to true. If defined, a link to the wikipedia page, in language
    defined by the locale option, corresponding to the feast of the day, is
    added to the date to be spread.

 PromptUser options

    If "msgmaker" option is PromptUser, instead of spreading the
    revolutionary date, prompts the user (with confirmation) for the
    message to be spread, with a default value (if user enters nothing when
    prompted).

  default

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string. If
    default option is set, the user is not prompted and this default
    message is spread. If default option is not defined, the default
    message is 'Goodbye old world, hello revolutionary worlds' if the user
    enters nothing when prompted. The default option should be defined in
    the [PromptUser] section of the configuration file. It is only used if
    "msgmaker" option is PromptUser.

  img_path (for PromptUser)

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string valued
    by a path to an image file on local disk. The img_path option should be
    defined in the [PromptUser] section of the configuration file. It is
    only used if "msgmaker" option is PromptUser.

  img_alt (for PromptUser)

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string valued
    by an alternative text to an image file specified by img_path or
    img_url options. The img_alt option should be defined in the
    [PromptUser] section of the configuration file. It is only used if
    "msgmaker" option is PromptUser.

  img_url (for PromptUser)

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string valued
    by an external url to a remote image. The img_url option should be
    defined in the [PromptUser] section of the configuration file. It is
    only used if "msgmaker" option is PromptUser.

 Gemini options

    If "msgmaker" option is Gemini, instead of spreading the revolutionary
    date, requests Gemini AI to generate a text from a prompt.

  api_key

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string: your
    Gemini API key. You have to get it following instructions on
    https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key. The api_key option
    should be defined in the [Gemini] section of the configuration file. It
    is only used if "msgmaker" option is Gemini.

  process

    This option can only be specified once, with a value as string, telling
    which "prompt" and other options below should be send to Gemini AI. The
    process option should be defined in the [Gemini] section of the
    configuration file. It is only used if "msgmaker" option is Gemini.

  prompt

    This option can be specified for several prompts, each one with a key
    as a string, valued by the string configured for "process" options
    above, and a value as string valued by the prompt to send to Gemini AI.
    The prompt option should be defined in the [Gemini] section of the
    configuration file. It is only used if "msgmaker" option is Gemini.

  intro

    This option can be specified for several prompts, each one with a key
    as a string, valued by the string configured for "process" options
    above, and a value as string to prepend to Gemini answer. The intro
    option should be defined in the [Gemini] section of the configuration
    file. It is only used if "msgmaker" option is Gemini.

  search

    This option can be specified for several prompts, each one with a key
    as a string, valued by the string configured for "process" options
    above, and a true value, telling Gemini AI to use grounded sources
    (inline supporting links) and Google Search suggestions. The search
    option should be defined in the [Gemini] section of the configuration
    file. It is only used if "msgmaker" option is Gemini.

  img_path (for Gemini)

    This option can be specified for several prompts, each one with a key
    as a string, valued by the string configured for "process" options

EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS

    Starting from version 0.07, this distribution takes advantage of Moose,
    the postmodern object system for Perl 5, allowing to easily extend
    spread-revolutionary-date to other targets than the default ones
    (Mastondon, Bluesky, Twitter, Liberachat and Freenode.

    To add a new target, you should write a new class in the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target:: namespace (that is: the class
    should be App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mytarget for a new
    Mytarget target), that consumes the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target role. See "DESCRIPTION" in
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target for a comprehensive description of
    this role.

    The name of the target should be added as a value of the "targets"
    option.

    Such a target class is actually just a wrapper. Usually a target has to
    use an existing specific worker module (which can be a Moose class or
    not) to perform the actual work of posting a message according the
    specific target protocol, after having complied with any potential
    required authentication. Such authentication should be carried on by
    the constructor or, along with posting, by the required spread method
    of the target class.

    To perform authentication and to post a message, there is a strong
    likelihood that the new target requires specific parameters (e.g.:
    tokens, keys, account name, password, channels, etc.). These parameters
    should be defined as required attributes of the target class. Values
    for such attributes should be set in the configuration file, inside a
    section named after the target in lower case ([mytarget]), or as
    command line parameters prefixed with the name of the target in lower
    case, followed by an underscore (--mytarget_myparam).

    Should you extend spread-revolutionary-date to a new target, we advise
    you to have a look on how default targets are implemented:
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Bluesky with
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mastodon with Mastodon::Client
    worker, App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::BlueskyLite worker, and
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Twitter with Twitter::API worker.
    Mastodon and Twitter are using OAuth2 protocol <https://oauth.net/2/>
    to perform authentication. The other default targets,
    <App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Liberachat> and
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Freenode, use a chatbot
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot>:
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Liberachat::Bot and
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Freenode::Bot, subclassing
    Bot::BasicBot worker. You can also see a very simple example with a
    test file provided in this distribution at t/new_target.t, which just
    prints out the revolutionary date on the standard output using core
    module IO::Handle.

    Your new App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mytarget target class
    should consumes the App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target role, by
    specifying the worker class:

      use Moose;
      with 'App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target'
        => {worker => 'My::Worker::Class'};

    Then, you have to add a hook, being called before Moose constructor, so
    to pass as an additional argument to Moose constructor, an instance of
    your worker class as obj attribute of your new target class. You may
    need some configuration parameters, like worker_param in the example
    below, to create an instance of your worker class:

      around BUILDARGS => sub {
        my ($orig, $class) = @_;
        my $args = $class->$orig(@_);
        my $args->{obj} = My::Worker::Class->new(worker_param => $args->{worker_param});
        return $args;
      }

    Starting from version 0.39, you may have noticed that Mastodon and
    Bluesky targets can now spread not only a text message, but also an
    image, with an alternative text for accessibily purpose. If the
    alternative text is not provided, it is set with the name of the image
    file. This is used by Telechat message maker, to post an image of
    Groucha, the presenter of Téléchat, and by PromptUser and Gemini to
    send either an image file on local disk or an external image on the
    web.

    This feature is not available now for IRC targets, Liberachat and
    Freenode, since theses targets are mostly for text messages.

    Also, we do not plan to extend this feature to Twitter target, since we
    recommand to not use this social network for political reasons.

    Starting from version 0.45, Mastodon and Bluesky classes have a
    max_lenght attribute (set to 300 for Mastodon and set to 250 for
    Bluesky), which is used to split a longer message into a thread of
    multiple posts. Again, we do not plan to extend this feature to Twitter
    target, since we recommand to not use this social network for political
    reasons.

EXTENDING TO NEW MESSAGE MAKERS

    It is even easier to spread whatever you want instead of the
    revolutionary date. You should write a new class in the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker:: namespace (that is: the class
    should be App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::MyMsgMaker for a new
    MyMsgMaker message maker), that consumes the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker role. See "DESCRIPTION" in
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker for a comprehensive description
    of this role.

    The name of the message maker should be set as a value of the
    "msgmaker" option.

    Such a message maker class is actually just a wrapper. Usually a
    message maker has to use an existing specific module (which can be a
    Moose class or not) to craft the message.
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::RevolutionaryDate uses
    DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary, while
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::PromptUser is based on
    IO::Prompt::Hooked and App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::Gemini
    just uses LWP to request Gemini server. You may need for example LWP to
    extract the message from a fetched web page or service, or XML::Feed to
    build it from a RSS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS> feed, or DBI to
    retrieve it from a database, or nothing at all to spread a fixed
    message, etc.

    If your new message maker class needs specific parameters (other than
    locale, which comes with App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker role),
    they should be defined as attributes of this class. Values for such
    attributes should be set in the configuration file, inside a section
    named after the message maker in lower case ([mymsgmaker]), or as
    command line parameters prefixed with the name of the message maker in
    lower case, followed by an underscore (--mymsgmaker_myparam).

    Have a look to App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::PromptUser or
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::Telechat classes, they show
    simple examples on how to extend spread-revolutionary-date to a new
    message maker.

 Gemini message maker

    From version 0.45, a new message maker is included which requests
    Gemini AI. This allows to extend spread-revolutionary-date just by
    configuring a few options. The most practical way to configure these
    options is to prepare everything by setting all "Gemini options" in the
    configuration file, except "process" to pickup the prompt at execution
    time by using the --gemini_process <ThisPrompt> command line parameter.

    This way, you can setup different prompts in your configuration file.
    Here is an example with 4 different prompts configured:

      [Gemini]
      # See https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
      api_key                      = 'GEMINI_API_KEY'
      prompt   FamousBirthday      = 'Which famous people have their birthday on $month_name $day? Give a list of up to 6 people, then after the list give the unformatted URL of the Wikipedia page of only one of them, no comments and no need for an introduction like "Here are some famous people".'
      intro    FamousBirthday      = 'FamousBirthday=Famous people born on $month_name $day for better or for worse:'
    
      prompt   MacronJokeColuche   = 'Invente-moi une blague dans le style de Coluche sur Emmanuel Macron. Pas besoin de dire "D\'accord, voici une blague" ou "Bien sûr, voici une blague dans le style de Coluche sur Emmanuel Macron" avant la blague.'
      img_path MacronJokeColuche   = '/usr/local/share/perl/5.32.1/auto/share/dist/App-SpreadRevolutionaryDate/images/coluche_macron.png'
      img_alt  MacronJokeColuche   = 'Caricature de Coluche disant : « C’est l’histoire d’un mec… » avec une caricature de macron'
    
      prompt   BlanquiRevival      = 'Invente-moi un dicton révolutionnaire dans le style d\'Auguste Blanqui. Ne fais pas d\'introduction.'
      img_url  BlanquiRevival      = 'https://example.com/imgs/my_image.jgp'
    
      prompt   MeteoParis          = 'Quelle est la météo aujourd\'hui à Paris, avec la température, selon meteo-paris.com, ne devine pas, va chercher l\'information.'
      search   MeteoParis          =  1

    and, then choose the prompt to use at execution time, like:

      $ spread-revolutionary-date --msgmaker=Gemini --gemini_process=FamousBirthday --locale=en
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --msgmaker=Gemini --gemini_process=MacronJokeColuche
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --msgmaker=Gemini --gemini_process=BlanquiRevival
      $ spread-revolutionary-date --msgmaker=Gemini --gemini_process=MeteoParis

    These examples show how you can tweak your message to be spread. Let's
    review all these options:

    First, you have to define credentials to use the Gemini API, by
    defining the "api_key" option. For this you need to get a Gemini API
    key, by following instructions on
    https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key.

    Then for each prompt, you have to choose an identifier, which is one
    word in camel case, like FamousBirthday, MacronJokeColuche,
    BlanquiRevival or MeteoParis. This prompt identifier should be the
    value of the --gemini_process <ThisPrompt> command line parameter.

    All other options are relative to one particular prompt, and therefore
    prefixed with the corresponding identifier. Under the hood, these
    options are hashes keyed with prompt identifiers:

    "prompt"

      This is the option where you can define your prompt. It is advised to
      test this prompt to have Gemini answer as you wish. For instance,
      Gemini often start its answers to your prompt by: “Sure, here is
      ‘what you've asked for’, and you wouldn't want to spread this
      introduction in your message. In this case, you should write your
      prompt instructing Gemini to not include any introduction.

      You can test your prompt with interactive form to Gemini at
      https://gemini.google.com/app or with spread-revolutionary-date with
      options --test and --targets=Mastodon for example.

      The spread message will be Gemini answer, optionally prepended with a
      configured introduction (see bellow), and ending with hashtags
      #IAGenerated #PromptIdentifier.

      Prompts often need to mention informations relative to today, such as
      the FamousBirthday example below, or it could be that you wanna ask
      Gemni for today's weather, or traffic jams occuring the same day of
      the week as today, etc. As a syntactic sugar, you can insert in
      "prompt" option, any variable prefixed with a dollar sign ($) which
      correspond to a method of DateTime module applied to DateTime-now()>
      object, and it will be replaced by the result of this method in the
      prompt sent to Gemini. For example, in the FamousBirthday example
      below, if run on June 21st, the prompt sent to Gemini would be:

        'Which famous people have their birthday on June 21? Give a list of up to 6 people, then after the list give the unformatted URL of the Wikipedia page of only one of them, no comments and no need for an introduction like "Here are some famous people".'

      You should be careful that such variables are not interpreted by the
      Shell before calling spread-revolutionary-date, specially if
      specified as command line parameters. You can prevent such
      intepretation by the Shell by enclosing the option in single quotes,
      like the examples above.

    "intro"

      You may want that the spread message to start with your own
      introducing words before displaying Gemini answer. You can specify
      this with the "intro" option.

      Likewise, this option use the same syntactic sugar relative to
      methods of DateTime module. For example, the message spread on June
      21st by the FamousBirthday example bellow, would be something like

        Famous people born on June 21 for better or for worse:
        First Name
        Second Name
        Third Name
        Fourth Name
        Fifth Name
        Sixth Name
      
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Name
        #IAGenerated #FamousBirthday

    "search"

      Gemini answer is based on data that have been used to train the AI.
      But sometimes you want accurate answers grounded on some real time
      searches. In this case, you should specify the "search" option with a
      true value, and Gemini answers will be grounded on grounded sources
      (inline supporting links) and Google Search suggestions.

      This is used in the MeteoParis example bellow, to have Gemini search
      for today's weather in Paris from meteo-paris.com website.

    "img_path"

      This option allows to add a local image on the spread message.

    "img_alt"

      This option specifies an alternative text to an image added on the
      spread message. If unset, the alternative text will be the name of
      the file specified in "img_path" or "img_url" options.

    "img_url"

      This option allows to add a remote image on the spread message.

    Finally, one word of localization: you don't need it, since Gemini will
    answer in the language you've used in your prompt. Or you can ask in
    your prompt to be answered in another language, like:

      prompt   FamousBirthday      = 'Which famous people have their birthday on $month_name $day? Give a list of up to 6 people, then after the list give the unformatted URL of the Wikipedia page of only one of them, no comments and no need for an introduction like "Here are some famous people" or "Hier sind 6 berühmte Persönlichkeiten,". Answer in German, please!.'

    The only place where you should be concerned by localization is when
    you define an introduction to be prepended to Gemini answer. Since it
    is a configured static string, it should be written in the desired
    language, like:

      intro    FamousBirthday      = 'FamousBirthday=Berühmte Personen, die am $day $month_name geboren wurden, im Guten wie im Schlechten:'

    Also, if you use some syntactic sugars relative to methods of DateTime
    module that are localizable, like month_name, you should use the
    "locale" option to have it translated in the desired language.

    And now you are ready to spread whatever your like, with just some
    configuration tweaks!

    Be aware that Gemini, like any other AI, has no concept of truth. It
    can only give formally probable answers, based on its training data. So
    do not ask somehing where truth matters… Also, all data you're sending
    to Gemini are assumed to not be private anymore and could be used by
    Google for any purpose! And finally, keep in mind that each request to
    Gemini AI consumes a huge amount of resources, which is detrimental to
    the environment.

INTERNATIONALIZATION AND LOCALIZATION

    Starting from version 0.11, this distribution uses the widespread
    internationalization and localization system gettext
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext>, commonly used for writing
    multilingual programs. See GNU gettext documentation
    <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html> for details. From
    the point of view of a translator, this is rather simple.

    Translators can find a portable object template
    po/App-SpreadRevolutionaryDate.pot which includes all translatable
    strings used by spread-revolutionary-date (but not translations of
    days, months, feasts used in the French Revolutionary Calendar, see
    below). They can copy this template to a portable object file of their
    language and translate strings of this file. For example, a German
    translator would work on po/de.po. All strings to be translated are
    laid down in lines beginning with msgid keyword, and translations
    should go on the next line beginning with keyword msgstr. E.g.:

      msgid "Please, enter message to spread"

    A German translator would have to replace the next line:

     msgstr ""

    by:

     msgstr "Bitte geben Sie die Nachricht zu verbreiten ein"

    When the string to be translated includes some words in curly braces,
    these words are actually named variables and should be left as is in
    the translation. E.g.:

      msgid "or {abort} to abort"
      msgstr "oder {abort}, um abzubrechen"

    And that's it! As of version 0.11 of spread-revolutionary-date, there
    is only about a dozen of strings to translate, mainly for PromptUser
    message maker. But with the possibility to extend to other message
    makers, you may need more and more strings to be translated.

    Translating days, months and feasts used in the RevolutionaryDate
    message maker do not use the gettext system. Mainly because it uses
    DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary which proposes French and
    English translations in dedicated Perl modules.
    spread-revolutionary-date keeps the same way for translating
    expressions used in the French revolutionary calendar, but, thanks to
    Moose::Role
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::RevolutionaryDate::Locale,
    translatable nominal groups have been isolated from other Perl code.
    Their translations lie in a consuming class in the
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::RevolutionaryDate::Locale::
    namespace for each translated language. These classes are named after
    the two-letter (ISO 639-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1>) or
    three-letter (ISO 639-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2> and
    ISO 639-3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3>) lowercase
    abbreviation of the corresponding language. For example, a German
    translator would work on
    App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::MsgMaker::RevolutionaryDate::Locale::de
    class.

    Just copy the French class (from
    lib/App/SpreadRevolutionaryDate/MsgMaker/RevolutionaryDate/Locale/fr.pm
    file) into the desired language, change the name of the class and
    replace every French string. E.g.: the names of the months should be
    replace in:

      has '+months' => (
        default => sub {[
          'Vendémiaire', 'Brumaire',  'Frimaire',
          'Nivôse',      'Pluviôse',  'Ventôse',
          'Germinal',    'Floréal',   'Prairial',
          'Messidor',    'Thermidor', 'Fructidor',
          'jour complémentaire',
        ]},
      );

    by names in German:

      has '+months' => (
        default => sub {[
          'Herbstmonat',    'Nebelmonat',  'Reifmonat',
          'Schneemonat',    'Regenmonat',  'Windmonat',
          'Keimmonat',      'Blütenmonat', 'Wiesenmonat',
          'Erntemonat',     'Hitzemonat',  'Fruchtmonat',
          'Ergänzungstage',
        ]},
      );

    Feasts include a special trick, because they can be used in sentences
    like this is feast name day or c'est le jour de la feast name.
    Depending on the language, it could then be prefixed or suffixed: in
    English it is suffixed by  day, whereas in French it is prefixed by
    jour de la . Prefixes are translated as an array of strings, while the
    suffix is translated in a single string. The reason is that in
    languages where the feast of the day is prefixed, the prefix often
    depends on the gender or the number of the noun used for the feast, or
    whereas this noun starts by a vowel, and other factors depending on the
    language. Therefore, each translation of the feast of each day should
    starts with a digit specifying the index (starting from 0) in the
    translated array of prefixes to use for this word. E.g.: with prefixes
    translated by ['jour du ', 'jour de la ', "jour de l'", 'jour des '],
    some feast can be translated by '1carotte', '2amaranthe', '0panais'
    (because you say: jour de la carotte, with prefix number 1, jour de
    l'amaranthe, with prefix number 2, and jour du panais, with prefix
    number 0). If the language does not use any prefix before the feast of
    the day, each translation for the feast of the day should start with 0,
    and the array of prefixes should include an empty string as its single
    element. If the language does not use a suffix after the feast of the
    day, the translation of the sufix should be an empty string.

    Note also that any space in the name of the feast of the day should be
    replaced by an underscore (_).

    Finally, these translation classes include a mapping between the feast
    of the day and the wikipedia entry for this word. This is useful when
    the feast of the day corresponds to an ambiguous entry, or a different
    word, in wikipedia. If the wikipedia entry is the same as the feast of
    the day, you can omit it. If the wikipedia entry is different from the
    feast of the day, you should add a line in the appropriate group of
    mappings for the considered month (groups of mappings are numbered from
    1 to 13). In the left part of this new mapping you should use the feast
    of the day as you have translated it, but without the number indicating
    the prefix and with spaces, not underscores. And in the right part of
    this new mapping, you should use the wikipedia entry, i.e. the end of
    the wikipedia url. E.g.:

      has '+wikipedia_entries' => (
        default => sub {{
          2 => {
            'water chestnut' => 'Water_caltrop',
          },
          8 => {
            'hoe'            => 'Hoe_(tool)',
          },
        }},
      );

    Because of the trick on prefix and suffix for feasts and the needed
    mapping for wikipedia entries, using the gettext system would be quite
    difficult. It wouldn't be an issue for translating names of months or
    days. But for consistency reasons, I'd rather group all these
    translations used in the French Revolutionary Calendar in the same
    translation class. Nevertheless, I'm open to find solutions if you
    think it would be easier to translate everything with the gettext
    system.
