version 0.005; 2017-08-11

  * update to accommodate PERL_OP_PARENT builds of Perl 5.21.11 or later
    (which is the default from Perl 5.25.1)

  * on Perl 5.25.3 and later, where a regular hash in scalar context
    yields the count of items in the hash, make the tied scalar(%shash)
    behave equivalently

  * update automatic configuration to not rely on . in @INC, which is
    no longer necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7

  * update for changed S_croak_xs_usage() prototype in ExtUtils::ParseXS
    3.30, requiring the new version of that module

  * skip t/taint.t if the perl empirically doesn't perform taint checks
    but the script got run anyway (which happens with an unsupported
    configuration of the Perl core which some people are using in the
    absence of a supported no-taint configuration)

  * test that all modules have matching version numbers

  * in documentation, update the stated Perl version beyond which the
    Unicode bug in the treatment of filenames might be fixed

  * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution

  * in documentation, use four-column indentation for all verbatim
    material

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker

  * rewrite some internal recursive functions to use the cursor system

  * to perform static assertion in C, rather than a hand-crafted
    formulation, use Perl's STATIC_ASSERT_DECL() macro (from Perl 5.27.1
    onwards) or STATIC_ASSERT_GLOBAL() macro (from Perl 5.21.7 until it
    was renamed to STATIC_ASSERT_DECL()), with a reserve definition for
    older Perls

  * avoid some compiler warnings that arise on Perl 5.6

  * use cBOOL() where appropriate

  * remove a duplicated assignment statement

version 0.004; 2015-01-28

  * port to Perl 5.21.1, where errno-based error messages (as seen in
    $!) depend on the state of the locale pragma

  * port to Perl 5.21.8, where it is necessary to work around bug [perl
    #123558] to test deparsing

  * new functions shash_key_min(), shash_key_max(), shash_key_ge(),
    shash_key_gt(), shash_key_le(), and shash_key_lt(), to iterate over
    the content of a shared hash, and corresponding ability to iterate a
    tied hash via each(%shash) and to enumerate it via keys(%shash) et al

  * new functions shash_keys_array() and shash_keys_hash() to enumerate
    the keys in a shared hash

  * new function shash_group_get_hash() to retrieve the full content of
    a shared hash

  * new function shash_occupied() to check whether a shared hash is
    non-empty, and corresponding ability to check occupancy of a tied
    hash via scalar(%shash)

  * new function shash_count() to count the items in a shared hash

  * new function shash_size() to determine approximate size of the
    content of a shared hash

  * new function shash_length() to get the length of a value without
    reifying the value as a string SV

  * add clearer name shash_exists() for the existing function shash_getd()

  * make returned reference scalars and tally value scalars unwritable

  * test that keys and values can contain NULs

  * test unwritability of returned mode strings

  * in documentation, clarify that shash_tidy() counts as a write
    operation

  * in documentation, correct grammar in the description of shash_open()
    and the equivalent constructor method

version 0.003; 2014-05-05

  * bugfix: on Perl 5.6, repair a dodgy workaround that could cause
    magical (e.g., tainted) arguments to lose their magic flags

  * bugfix: build custom ops in a way that satisfies an unnecessary
    assertion in debugging Perl builds

  * new function shash_idle() to prevent an idle handle keeping an
    obsolete data file around

  * when tidying, include a non-zero constant term in the computation
    of the new file size, to avoid cycling data files very rapidly when
    the shared hash contains little data

  * count events for profiling and debugging, counters accessed
    through new functions shash_tally_get(), shash_tally_zero(), and
    shash_tally_gzero()

  * make the constant shash_referential_handle also available as a class
    method on Hash::SharedMem::Handle

  * when attempting to unlink a file, other than for cleanup of an
    operation that died, if unlinking fails for reasons other than ENOENT
    or EBUSY, report the error, rather than silently ignoring it

  * cooperate in the tainting system, mainly imitating the taint behaviour
    of regular file handles

  * support using the module in multiple threads simultaneously,
    including, on Perl 5.8.9 and later, duplicating handles for thread
    spawning

  * cope on Cygwin, which offers a fraudulent openat(2) et al

  * avoid a C99 declaration-after-statement construction

  * avoid using "NULL" for null function pointers, for C compiler
    portability

  * be cleverer about the asymmetry of key ranges in the B-tree structure,
    saving about one key comparison per data operation

  * use cursors internally, so that the key has to be resolved only
    once for each combined read-and-write operation (shash_gset()
    and shash_cset())

  * when attempting a data file rollover, if the attempt fails due to
    a conflicting update from another process, unmap the abortive data
    file before attempting to unlink it, so that the unlink will succeed
    on OSes that need a mapped file to remain linked

  * in documentation, comment on the inefficiency that occurs when the
    shared hash doesn't fit into RAM

  * in documentation, comment on the Unicode bug in the treatment of
    filenames

  * don't uselessly attempt to hook into B::Deparse on Perls where custom
    ops aren't registered and so the hook can't work

  * don't uselessly attempt to hook into B::Deparse for the
    shash_referential_handle constant which isn't a custom op type

  * test concurrency with real concurrent racing processes

  * test that a forked handle works correctly

  * include magic(5) file, describing the identifying part of the format
    of shared hash files, in the distribution

  * manage destruction of shared hash handles through magic rather than
    a DESTROY method, for a small speedup

  * restructure the internal representation of directory references,
    for a small simplification of uses of the references

  * in test suite, extend to shash_tidy() some patterns of tests that
    cover most operators and which were missed when shash_tidy() was
    added to the module

  * slight refactoring of C code

  * on systems that lack mmap(2), detect the problem cleanly and report
    it in a way that CPAN Testers understand

  * in design document and code, use the more standard term "fanout"
    instead of "splay"

  * take todo notes out of code comments

version 0.002; 2014-03-25

  * new function shash_tidy() to make data file rollover happen at a
    convenient time

  * in many error messages, state more specifically and consistently
    what kind of action has failed

  * in documentation, consistently describe the content of a shared hash
    as "content" rather than "contents"

version 0.001; 2014-03-23

  * bugfix: avoid overflowing a directory entry buffer on OSes where
    struct dirent is not a suitable size for a buffer

  * bugfix: avoid overflowing a filename buffer when time exceeds the
    32-bit range (a year 2038 problem) or PIDs are larger than 32 bits

  * ensure reliable behaviour across fork(2), by not holding on to
    allocated data file space between write operations

  * create all data files with the same permission bits as the master
    file, so that the permissions set when the shash was created stick,
    and the umask at the time of shash operations doesn't matter

  * attempt to give all data files the same group and owner as the master
    file, so that permissions behave as consistently as possible

  * new exported constant shash_referential_handle to indicate whether
    shared hash handles constitute first-class references to the
    underlying files

  * detect non-octet string values for key and value parameters reliably
    and early, consistently signalling the error

  * detect non-string values for filename parameters, signalling the error

  * process get magic on each parameter exactly once per hash operation
    (though users of the tied interface are at the mercy of the tying
    infrastructure, which doesn't have such clean behaviour)

  * when attempting to clean a shash directory, if listing the directory
    fails, report the error, rather than silently abandoning the cleaning
    attempt

  * when attempting to generate a new data file, if the size is so large
    as to cast to a negative off_t value, detect it early and report
    EFBIG, rather than going ahead to create the file and detect the
    error at ftruncate(2) time

  * if ftruncate(2) reports that a requested file size is too big using
    errno EINVAL, report it as the more enlightening EFBIG

  * when attempting to iterate a shash directory, if opening the directory
    fails, detect it and report the real error, rather than going ahead
    to fdopendir(3) and detecting its EBADF

  * when reporting an error including the name of a shash, to match
    user expectations use the characters of the filename scalar that
    was supplied upon opening, even though the octets of the scalar's
    internal representation are what are actually used as the filename

  * automatically detect and adapt to the machine architecture's line
    and page size, to improve performance on architectures other than
    IA32/AMD64

  * port to pre-5.14 Perls, back to 5.6

  * automatically use the -lrt library on systems where it is required
    in order to get access to clock_gettime(2)

  * cope on systems where openat(2) et al are not available, either not
    defined by the headers, or defined but not functioning

  * cope on systems where clock_gettime(2) is not available, either not
    defined by the headers, or defined but not functioning

  * cope on systems where O_CLOEXEC is not available, either not defined
    by the headers, or defined but not honoured (or not accepted) by
    the kernel

  * when iterating a shash directory, open a new file descriptor rather
    than duplicate the existing one, avoiding portability problems with
    F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC

  * use symbolic constants for file permission bits, for portability to
    systems where they have non-traditional values

  * cope on systems where the headers don't define MAP_FAILED

  * check at compile time that the word data type is of exactly the
    required size

  * on Perls that support it, hook into B::Deparse to make the custom
    ops deparse nicely

  * many new tests

  * document the effects of file-level operations on shared hash
    directories

  * document the tied(%shash) operator as part of the tied interface

  * clarify documentation about permitted keys and values

  * in documentation, mention serialisation and refer to Sereal

  * perform string equality comparisons more efficiently by specific
    code separate from ordering comparisons

  * use more efficient variants of Perl API functions where available

  * use the Perl-version-dependent matching data type to save
    PL_tmps_floor, rather than an invariant sufficiently-large type

  * declare C functions as inline where it'll help for compilers that
    need the hint

  * make some printf operations cheaper by taking advantage of Perl's
    requirement that the C int type is at least 32 bits

  * shuffle C struct members for better packing on 32-bit systems

  * small clarifications to design document

  * slight refactoring of C code

  * avoid some C compiler warnings

version 0.000; 2014-02-27

  * initial released version
