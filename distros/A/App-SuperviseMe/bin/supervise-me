=head1 NAME

supervise_me - supervises a list of commands

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Read commands to keep up from STDIN
    $ supervise_me
    Enter commands to supervise, one per line
    plackup -p 3010 ./sites/x/app.psgi
    plackup -p 3011 ./sites/y/app.psgi
    ^D

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<supervise_me> command is a simple supervisor for multiple process.

It reads a list of commands to execute from C<< STDIN >> and starts each one,
and then monitors their execution. If one of the program dies, the supervisor
will restart it after a small 1 second pause.

You can restart the supervised process with C<< Ctrl-C >>. If you hit
C<< Ctrl-C >> again before the supervised process restart, the supervisor will
exit. This allows you to use one tap of C<< Ctrl-C >> to restart, and a
double tap to exit.
