 * fix (in cleanup) errors related to schema object DESTROY function
   on some versions of DBIC
 * added create_phenotypeprop function (naama)
 * fix filenames of Chado-module-level POD files.  For instance,
   Bio::Chado::Schema::Result::Sequence POD is now rightly in
   lib/Bio/Chado/Schema/Result/Sequence.pod

0.10000   2011-11-07 13:22:41 America/Los_Angeles

0.09020   2011-11-02 17:30:03 America/Los_Angeles

 * implemented alphabet() function for Feature rows using as a silly
   heuristic that works in many cases.  alphabet() is needed by things
   like revcom() in newer versions of BioPerl.

0.09010   2011-10-24 11:25:25 America/Los_Angeles

 * added get_cvterm and get_cvterm_or_die convenience methods directly
   to the schema object, since cvterms are so pervasive in chado
 * added to_range to Featureloc class that makes a Bio::Range object
   for that location.

0.09000   2011-09-22 09:27:36 America/Los_Angeles

 * update for Chado 1.2, including:
    + add classes for new Chado 1.2 tables chadoprop (Cv::Chadoprop)
      genotypeprop (Genetic::Genotypeprop)
    + adds type to nd_protocol (NaturalDiversity::NdProtocol)
    + adds name column to phenotype table (Phenotype::Phenotype)
    + corrects misspelled name of stock_relationship_id column
      accessor for stock_relationship_cvterm
      (Stock::StockRelationshipCvterm), adds stock_relationship DBIC
      relation

   columns for stock_cvterm

0.08002   2011-02-22 11:17:13 America/Los_Angeles

 * Added support for new cvprop table.
 * Added plugin_add_relationship class method to Bio::Chado::Schema
   main class, which makes it possible to do BCS plugins: sets of
   classes in the Bio::Chado::Schema namespace that are loaded as part
   of BCS.  plugin_add_relationship lets plugins inject relationships
   into the core BCS classes.

0.07300   2010-11-28 17:19:08 PST8PDT

 * Add convenient featureloc length() method.
 * Add better support for large sequences: a subseq() method to
   Feature class with support for checking a 'large_residues'
   featureprop for sequence, and doing substring calls on that.

0.07100   2010-11-16 12:28:17 PST8PDT

 * Fix bug with Cvterm add_secondary_dbxref, only caught under
   DBIx::Class >= 0.08124
 * add convenience methods for creating stock_dbxrefprops,
   nd_experimentprops, projectprops, and geolocationprops
 * add methods for working with parent and child terms of cvterms
 * Convert t/lib/BCSTest.pm to Bio::Chado::Schema::Test so other
   CPAN modules can have test suites that use an
   automagically-created SQLite db

0.06400   2010-10-20 20:54:37 PST8PDT

 * added naama's stock_dbxrefprop from upstream chado

0.05801

 * Fix bugs and add tests for child_features and parent_features on
   Sequence::Feature

   Sequence::Feature as more intuitive aliases for
   feature_relationship_*

 * New aliases on Sequence::Feature
    child_features  -> featureloc_features
    parent_features -> featureloc_srcfeatures
 * Added a function for creating cvtermsynonyms ($cvterm->add_synonym)
 * Added a function for creating new cvtermprops ($cvterm->create_cvtermprops) 
 * Test suite can now deploy a Chado schema to a SQLite database
   if BCS_TEST_DSN is not defined. This means that smokers can
   now run these tests without setting up any databases.
