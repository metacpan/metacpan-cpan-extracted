Geo/Postcode/Valid
===============================

Hello. This is a very simple module that tests the well-formedness of UK
postcodes and incidentally splits them into useful parts.

For US zipcodes, you need Geo::Postalcode.

It has been developed for geographical systems that work with postcodes
at variable resolution: in other words, for people like me who can only
afford to buy the cheaper postcode data sets. It should also be of use
to people who want to validate input, as it should be very quick and
memory efficient and doesn't load the location data or associated libraries
until you ask for it.

any trouble, write to wross@cpan.org or post a bug at rt.cpan.org.
