DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a powerful way to resolve placeholders inside of a
    templated file. It uses Template::Transformer to interpolate the the
    placeholder values.

CONSTRUCTORS

 new(\%entity, %options)

    Creates a new resolver with properties from \%entity and %options if
    any. The available options are:

    additional_transforms

      Additional custom transforms that will be added to the standard
      transforms. Must be a hashref containing transform name to sub
      reference mappings. The sub reference(s) will be called as a
      method(s) with a single parameter containing the contents of the
      placeholder.

    os

      The operating system path format used when resolving
      ${TEMPLATE_os{xxx}} placeholders.
