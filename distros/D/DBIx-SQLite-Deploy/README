NAME
    DBIx::SQLite::Deploy - Easy SQLite deployment

VERSION
    Version 0.011

SYNOPSIS
        # ::Deploy will create the 'path/to' for you if it does not already exist
        my $deploy = DBIx::SQLite::Deploy->deploy( path/to/database.sqlite => <<_END_ )
        [% PRIMARY_KEY = "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT" %]
        [% KEY = "INTEGER" %]
        [% CLEAR %]
        ---
        CREATE TABLE artist (

            id                  [% PRIMARY_KEY %],
            uuid                TEXT NOT NULL,

            name                TEXT,
            description         TEXT,

            UNIQUE (uuid)
        );
        ---
        CREATE TABLE cd (

            id                  [% PRIMARY_KEY %],

            title               TEXT,
            description         TEXT
        );
        _END_

    To use with DBI

        $dbh = $deploy->connect 

        # ...or the long way:

        $dbh = DBI->connect( $deploy->information )

    To use with DBIx::Class

        $schema = My::Schema->connect( $deploy->information )

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::SQLite::Deploy is a tool for creating a database and getting back
    a DBI connection in as little work as possible. Essentially, you pass
    the path of your database and the schema (as a Template Toolkit
    template) to "DBIx::SQLite::Deploy->deploy". If the database is not
    there (file does not exist or is size 0), then ::Deploy will create the
    database and install the schema

Why Template Toolkit?
    Purely as a convenience. You probably have lots of repetition in your
    schema, and TT gives a way to combat that redundancy. You don't need to
    use it if you don't want/need to.

USAGE
  $deploy = DBIx::SQLite::Deploy->deploy( <path>, [ <schema> ], ... )
    Create a new deployment using <path> as the file for the SQLite
    database, and <schema> as the (optional) schema

    The schema argument can be in the form of a Template Toolkit document.

    The database will NOT be created until you ask to "->connect", ask for
    "->information", or manually "->deploy". To do creation on construction,
    pass "create => 1" as an argument

    DBIx::SQLite::Deploy will not deploy over an existing database (the file
    exists and has non-zero size)

  $deploy->connect
    Return a DBI database handle ($dbh)

  $deploy->information
  $deploy->info
    Return a list of connection information, suitable for passing to
    "DBI->connect"

  $deploy->deploy
    Deploy the database unless it already exists
