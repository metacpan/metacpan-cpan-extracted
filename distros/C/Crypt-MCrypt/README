NAME
    Crypt::MCrypt - Perl interface for libmcrypt C library.

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::MCrypt;
 
         my $iv = pack("H*","0000000000000000");
         my $key = pack("H*","1234567890123456" . "7890123456789012" . "1234567890123456");
         my $cipher_text = pack("H*","E9FF3161EE05ABC9" 
             . "7ea3cacb991318aa" 
             . "585379599b0eaabb" 
             . "c4e474ead1956f47" 
             . "6755f13f1af5235d");
         my $algorithm = "tripledes";
         my $mode = "cbc";
         my $obj = Crypt::MCrypt->new(
             algorithm => $algorithm, 
             mode      => $mode,
             key       => $key, 
             iv        => $iv,
         );
         my $plain_text = $obj->decrypt($cipher_text);
         print "\nPLAIN: $plain_text\n";
         print "\nPLAIN in hex: " . unpack("H*",$plain_text) . "\n";
         $cipher_text = $obj->encrypt($plain_text);
         print "\nCIPHER: $cipher_text\n";
         print "\nCIPHER in hex: " . unpack("H*",$cipher_text) . "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This is a perl interface to libmcrypt c library. It exposes the crypto
    functions provided by the libmcrypt library in a perl interface with a
    binding code that accounts for null C strings in ciphertext or plain
    text.

ATTRIBUTES
  algorithm
    contains the name of the algorithm used to decrypt encrypt blocks of
    data

  mode
    contains the name of the block cipher mode of operation
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation> used to
    encrypt/decrypt blocks of data.

  key
    contains the key for the encryption decryption algorithm

  Initialization Vector
    contains the Initialization for the first block of data in block cipher
    mode of operation.

METHODS
  $self->decrypt($ciphertext)
    decrypt blocks of ciphertext

  $self->encrypt($ciphertext)
    encrypt blocks of data

USAGE
    *   This module provides a object oriented interface to the libmcrypt
        library. It uses Mo, a scaled down version of Moose without any data
        checks to improve speed.

see ALSO
    *   Mo
