NAME
    Devel::GlobalPhase - Detect perl's global phase on older perls.

SYNOPSIS
        use Devel::GlobalPhase;
        print global_phase; # RUN

        use Devel::GlobalPhase -var;
        print ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}; # RUN

DESCRIPTION
    This gives access to ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} in versions of perl that don't
    provide it. The built in variable will be used if it is available.

    If all that is needed is detecting global destruction,
    Devel::GlobalDestruction should be used instead of this module.

EXPORTS
  global_phase
    Returns the global phase either from "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" or by
    calculating it.

OPTIONS
  -var
    If this option is specified on import, the global variable
    "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" will be created if it doesn't exist, emulating the
    built in variable from newer perls.

BUGS
    *   There are tricks that can be played with B or XS that would fool
        this module for the INIT and END phase.

    *   During an "END {}" block created at runtime after this module is
        loaded, the phase may be reported as "RUN". While this could be made
        more accurate, it would slow down the module significantly during
        the RUN phase, and has the potential to segfault perl.
