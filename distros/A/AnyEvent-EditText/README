NAME
    AnyEvent::EditText - An easy way to startup a text editor

VERSION
    Version 0.2

SYNOPSIS
       my $content = "Hello There!";

       AnyEvent::EditText::edit ($content, sub {
          my ($newcontent, $has_changed) = @_;

          if ($has_changed) {
             print "the content was edited";
          }
       });

DESCRIPTION
    This little module will start a text editor in a seperate process
    without stopping the current process. Usually something like a terminal
    with a vim instance running in it will be started, but also a graphical
    editor could be used (like *gedit* or *gvim*).

    The editor will get the content passed to the "edit" routine as
    temporary file, and after you are done editing it (closed the editor)
    the callback will be called with the possibly new content.

FUNCTIONS
  set_editor (@sysargs)
    This function configures the editor used. @sysargs is a list of
    arguments for the "system" function, which will be called like this by
    "edit":

       system (@sysargs, $filename);

    The default editor used will be:

       AnyEvent::EditText::set_editor ("rxvt", "-e", "vim");

  edit ($content, $callback)
    This routine will write $content to a temporary file, fork and call the
    editing process. After the process terminates the temporary file is read
    and erased.

    After that the content is sent back to the calling process, where the
    $callback is called with two arguments: The first will be the new
    content and the second a flag indicating whether the content has
    changed.

TODO
    This module should probably first look in the environment to determine
    which editor and terminal to use. This will be fixed in the next
    release.
