<p>There are different types of paragraphs.  Ordinary paragraphs, blocks
of preformatted text, blocks of verbatim html markup and text, and
code blocks.</p>

<pre><em>Blocks of preformatted</em> text are delimited with single curly
braces.

All paragraphs that contain preformatted text <strong>can contain empty
lines</strong>, that are normally used to separate distinct paragraph.
Preformatted paragraphs are exempted from this rule.</pre>


<p><em>Verbatim blocks</em> are an escape route, if the WikiText markup is
not enough.  Don't confuse verbatim blocks with verbatim inline
markup.  Verbatim blocks, in contrast to ordinary paragraphs with
inline verbatim content, don't force paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) context
on their content.</p>


<pre><code>Code blocks are like preformatted blocks, but also suppress the
normal WikiText markup substitution.  This allows the writer to
include arbitrary text (like sourcecode, quotations, etc), without
needing to escape any characters.</code></pre>

<pre><code>With the (code) ... (end) syntax, the text doesn't need to be
specially indented.  Just make sure there's no line in the text that
contains only the string &quot;(end)&quot;.  It might be mistaken for the end of
the paragraph.

Remember: Don't terminate on empty lines.</code></pre>

<p>Indentation is measured on the second line of a paragraph, if
possible.  This allows the first line to be indented further than the
rest of the paragraph, which is common practice in some countries.</p>

<p><b>Special Note</b> Ordinary paragraphs can contain a heading.  It is marked with a pair
of colons, on the first line.</p>

<p><b>Special Note #2</b> Paragraph headings don't necessarily stand alone on
the first line.</p>

<p><b>No extraneous newline</b> </p>

<hr />


<p><b>Proposition to parsing</b></p>
<p>Read a single line, store indentation.  Determine paragraph type from
first few characters and select end-of-paragraph predicate (based on
line content and line indentation).  End all environments with higher
indentation than current paragraph.  Read lines until
end-of-paragraph, stripping leading whitespace.</p>

<p>Run whole paragraph through inline markup substitution (or other
processing), if applicable, and output the paragraph.</p>
