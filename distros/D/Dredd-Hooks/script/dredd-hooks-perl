# dredd-hooks-perl - Code for running the TCP socket for Dredd hooks
#
# Dredd runs its hooks by starting up a script that must
# start a TCP server that will receive transactions as JSON.
# It should run each hook associated with the submitted event
# and return the modified transaction data.
#
# This script provides the socket handler and hands each event to
# event handler. It is also responsible for gather the hook files
# from the command line and passing them to the event handler
