Acme/Bushisms version 0.02
==========================

NAME
  Acme::Bushisms - Dubya Does Perl

DESCRIPTION
  The first time you run a program under `use Acme::Bushisms', the
  module removes all the unsightly printable, democrat, and liberal 
  characters from your source file. The code continues to work
  exactly as it did before, but now contains Bush speak.
 
INSTALLATION
  It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate              
  local Perl subdirectory
