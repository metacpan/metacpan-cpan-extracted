Revision history for CGI-Application-Plugin-LinkIntegrity

0.06 May 18, 2006
        - the entry point code added so many months ago had a bug in it:
          When there is a blank query string, CGI.pm adds an empty 'keywords'
          key to the query paremeters.  This meant that 'GET' requests
          without parameters would fail.

        - now install 'invalid_checksum' hook at class load time

0.04 October 3, 2005
        - made the module actually useful!  In order to generate a valid
          link, you need to load the module.  However you can't load the
          module if the application was invoked with an invalid URL.
          Catch-22.  So now there's an entry point:  if the invoking URL
          contained no parameters, then it is considered to be valid.

        - changed setup of hooks to happen at config time instead of
          import time.  Hopefully this makes it possible to use '@ISA'
          instead of 'use base':

              # Typical usage
              use base 'CGI::Application';
              use CGI::Application::Plugin::LinkIntegrity;

              # This also works
              use CGI::Application;
              our @ISA = qw(CGI::Application);
              use CGI::Application::Plugin::LinkIntegrity;

        - made CGI version 2.37 or greater a prerequisite (for url_param)

        - NOTE:  This release is not compatible with previous versions.
        - API radically rewritten to make it possible to protect links
          directly from within templates (Thanks to Michael Peter and
          Mark Stosberg for the feedback and ideas)
        - the following methods have changed:

          Old Syntax                                         New Syntax
          ==========                                         ==========
          ->make_link($url, { 'p1' => 'v1'})                 ->link($url, 'p1' => 'v1')

          ->make_self_link($url,                             ->self_link($url, 'p1' => 'v1')
                            keep_path_info => 1,
                            params => { 'p1' => 'v1'})

          ->make_self_link($url,                             ->path_link('', 'p1' => 'v1')
                            keep_path_info => 0,
                            params => { 'p1' => 'v1'})

          ->make_self_link($url,                             ->path_link('/new/path', 'p1' => 'v1')
                            path_info => '/new/path'
                            params => { 'p1' => 'v1'}
                          )

        - added documentation illustrating how to call link, make_link,
          etc. directly from templates

0.02 ????
        - added 'additional_data' feature

0.01 ????
        - First development version released for comments and feedback
