NAME
    Mail::GPG - Handling of GnuPG encrypted / signed mails

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::GPG;

      my $mg = Mail::GPG->new;

      my %keys_id2mail = $mg->query_keyring (
        search => 'joern@zyn.de',
      );

      my $entity = MIME::Entity->build (
        From     => 'joern@zyn.de',
        Subject  => "Mail::GPG Testmail",
        Data     => [ "Hiho, a nice encrypted mail" ],
        Encoding => "quoted-printable",
        Charset  => "iso-8859-1",
      );

      my $encrypted_entity = $mg->mime_sign_encrypt (
        entity     => $entity,
        key_id     => $key_id,
        password   => 'topsecret',
        recipients => [ 'niceguy@zyn.de' ],
      );

      my $mail_text = $encrypted_entity->as_string;

      # and a lot more...

      $mg->mime_sign ( ... );
      $mg->mime_encrypt ( ... );
      $mg->mime_sign_encrypt ( ... );

      $mg->armor_sign ( ... );
      $mg->armor_encrypt ( ... );
      $mg->armor_sign_encrypt ( ... );

      $mg->parse ( ... );

      $mg->decrypt ( ... );
      $mg->verify ( ... );

      $mg->is_encrypted ( ... );
      $mg->is_signed ( ... );

      $mg->get_key_trust ( ... );

DESCRIPTION
    This Perl modules handles all the details of encrypting and signing
    Mails using GnuPG according to RFC 3156 and RFC 2440, that is OpenPGP
    MIME and traditional armor signed/encrypted mails.

PREREQUISITES
      Perl              >= 5.00503
      MIME-tools        >= 5.419
      MIME::QuotedPrint >= 2.20  (part of MIME-Base64 distribution)
      GnuPG::Interface  >= 0.52
      Event             >= 1.24
      List::MoreUtils   >= 0.410

    Since version 1.0.7 the Event module is loaded when present. This gives
    a small performance boost when handling big entities. If you like to
    fallback to the old IO::Select based behaviour set either

      $Mail::GPG::SKIP_EVENT    = 1
      $ENV{MAIL_GPG_SKIP_EVENT} = 1

    before loading Mail::GPG.

INSTALLATION
    Then install Mail::GPG

      % cd ../Mail-GPG-x.xx
      % perl Makefile.PL
      % make test
      % make install

    Mail::GPG has a bunch of tests which will create a temporary gpg keyring
    to be able to do real encryption and stuff. You need to have gpg in your
    path for the tests to succeed, otherwise all useful tests will be
    skipped.

    Note that the test 04.big needs some time, on an Athlon 1800XP about 12
    seconds, so be patient ;)

    You can contact me by email. Please place the module name "Mail::GPG"
    somewhere in the subject, because I filter my mails that way. I'm a
