Feature oriented Revision history for Test-DBIC-ExpectedQueries
===============================================================

2.000 -- 2019-07-17 21:14:39 UTC

* BREAKING CHANGE -- This release includes a bug fix to the
  library. It now tests queries more comprehensively (i.e. all
  queries).

  You may find your tests now breaking when previously they didn't. If
  this happens, you always had inaccurate tests but
  Test::DBIC::ExpectedQueries didn't flag this up correctly.

  This is the fault of this library, not your code. Sorry about that!

  It is however your problem, and now you need to fix your tests.

  If you need to make your tests pass immediately, pin the version to
  pre 2.000, e.g. if you have a "cpanfile" in your project:

    requires "Test::DBIC::ExpectedQueries", "< 2.0";

  The fix you need to make is that the library will now report queries
  that were supposed to run n times, but didn't run at all. Let's say
  you have the check:

    { book_lender => { select => 1 } }

  You might see failures for queries that were supposed to run n times, but
  didn't run at all, e.g.

    Expected '1' inserts for table 'book_lender', got '0

  Whether this is a problem or not depends on the situation. Either
  you're happy that you're not making any redundant queries because
  the information is cached or prefetched. Or this indicates a
  problem, because something that you thought happened isn't.

  In the former case, a useful fix is to either remove the line or to
  relax the test:

    { book_lender => { select => "<= 1" } }
