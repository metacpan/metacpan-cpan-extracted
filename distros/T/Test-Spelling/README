NAME
    Test::Spelling - Check for spelling errors in POD files

SYNOPSIS
    Place a file, "pod-spell.t" in your distribution's "xt/author"
    directory:

        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Test::More;

        use Test::Spelling;
        use Pod::Wordlist;

        add_stopwords(<DATA>);
        all_pod_files_spelling_ok( qw( bin lib ) );

        __DATA__
        SomeBizarreWord
        YetAnotherBIzarreWord

    Or, you can gate the spelling test with the environment variable
    "AUTHOR_TESTING":

        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Test::More;

        BEGIN {
            plan skip_all => "Spelling tests only for authors"
                unless $ENV{AUTHOR_TESTING};
        }

        use Test::Spelling;
        use Pod::Wordlist;

        all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Spelling lets you check the spelling of a "POD" file, and report
    its results in standard Test::More fashion. This module requires a
    spellcheck program such as Hunspell <http://hunspell.github.io/>,
    aspell, spell, or, ispell. We suggest using Hunspell.

        use Test::Spelling;
        pod_file_spelling_ok('lib/Foo/Bar.pm', 'POD file spelling OK');

    Note that it is a bad idea to run spelling tests during an ordinary CPAN
    distribution install, or in a package that will run in an uncontrolled
    environment. There is no way of predicting whether the word list or
    spellcheck program used will give the same results. You can include the
    test in your distribution, but be sure to run it only for authors of the
    module by guarding it in a "skip_all unless $ENV{AUTHOR_TESTING}"
    clause, or by putting the test in your distribution's xt/author
    directory. Anyway, people installing your module really do not need to
    run such tests, as it is unlikely that the documentation will acquire
    typos while in transit.

    You can add your own stop words, which are words that should be ignored
    by the spell check, like so:

        add_stopwords(qw(asdf thiswordiscorrect));

    Adding stop words in this fashion affects all files checked for the
    remainder of the test script. See Pod::Spell (which this module is built
    upon) for a variety of ways to add per-file stop words to each .pm file.

    If you have a lot of stop words, it's useful to put them in your test
    file's "DATA" section like so:

        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Test::More;

        use Test::Spelling;
        use Pod::Wordlist;

        add_stopwords(<DATA>);
        all_pod_files_spelling_ok();

        __DATA__
        folksonomy
        Jifty
        Zakirov

    To maintain backwards compatibility, comment markers and some whitespace
    are ignored. In the near future, the preprocessing we do on the
    arguments to "add_stopwords" in Test::Spelling will be changed and
    documented properly.

FUNCTIONS
    Test::Spelling makes the following methods available.

  add_stopwords
      add_stopwords(@words);
      add_stopwords(<DATA>); # pull in stop words from the DATA section

    Add words that should be skipped by the spell checker. Note that
    Pod::Spell already skips words believed to be code, such as everything
    in verbatim (indented) blocks and code marked up with "...", as well as
    some common Perl jargon.

  all_pod_files
      all_pod_files();
      all_pod_files(@list_of_directories);

    Returns a list of all the Perl files in each directory and its
    subdirectories, recursively. If no directories are passed, it defaults
    to blib if blib exists, or else lib if not. Skips any files in CVS or
    .svn directories.

    A Perl file is:

    *   Any file that ends in .PL, .pl, .plx, .pm, .pod or .t.

    *   Any file that has a first line with a shebang and "perl" on it.

    Furthermore, files for which the filter set by "set_pod_file_filter"
    return false are skipped. By default, this filter passes everything
    through.

    The order of the files returned is machine-dependent. If you want them
    sorted, you'll have to sort them yourself.

  all_pod_files_spelling_ok
      all_pod_files_spelling_ok(@list_of_files);
      all_pod_files_spelling_ok(@list_of_directories);

    Checks all the files for "POD" spelling. It gathers "all_pod_files" in
    Test::Spelling on each file/directory, and declares a "plan" in
    Test::More for you (one test for each file), so you must not call "plan"
    yourself.

    If @files is empty, the function finds all "POD" files in the blib
    directory if it exists, or the lib directory if it does not. A "POD"
    file is one that ends with .pod, .pl, .plx, or .pm; or any file where
    the first line looks like a perl shebang line.

    If there is no working spellchecker (determined by
    <Test:Spelling/"has_working_spellchecker">), this test will issue a
    "skip all" directive.

    If you're testing a distribution, just create an xt/author/pod-spell.t
    with the code in the "SYNOPSIS".

    Returns true if every "POD" file has correct spelling, or false if any
    of them fail. This function will show any spelling errors as
    diagnostics.

    * NOTE: This only tests using bytes. This is not decoded content, etc.
    Do not expect this to work with Unicode content, for example. This uses
    an open with no layers and no decoding.

  get_pod_parser
      # a Pod::Spell -like object
      my $object = get_pod_parser();

    Get the object we're using to parse the "POD". A new Pod::Spell object
    should be used for every file. People providing custom parsers will have
    to do this themselves.

  has_working_spellchecker
      my $cmd = has_working_spellchecker;

    "has_working_spellchecker" will return "undef" if there is no working
    spellchecker, or a true value (the spellchecker command itself) if there
    is. The module performs a dry-run to determine whether any of the
    spellcheckers it can will use work on the current system. You can use
    this to skip tests if there is no spellchecker. Note that
    "all_pod_files_spelling_ok" will do this for you.

    A full list of spellcheckers which this method might test can be found
    in the source of the "spellchecker_candidates" method.

  pod_file_spelling_ok
      pod_file_spelling_ok('/path/to/Foo.pm');
      pod_file_spelling_ok('/path/to/Foo.pm', 'Foo is well spelled!');

    "pod_file_spelling_ok" will test that the given "POD" file has no
    spelling errors.

    When it fails, "pod_file_spelling_ok" will show any spelling errors as
    diagnostics.

    The optional second argument is the name of the test. If it is omitted,
    "pod_file_spelling_ok" chooses a default test name "POD spelling for
    $filename".

    * NOTE: This only tests using bytes. This is not decoded content, etc.
    Do not expect this to work with Unicode content, for example. This uses
    an open with no layers and no decoding.

  set_pod_file_filter
        # code ref
        set_pod_file_filter(sub {
            my $filename = shift;
            return 0 if $filename =~ /_ja.pod$/; # skip Japanese translations
            return 1;
        });

    If your project has "POD" documents written in languages other than
    English, then obviously you don't want to be running a spellchecker on
    every Perl file. "set_pod_file_filter" lets you filter out files
    returned from "all_pod_files" (and hence, the documents tested by
    "all_pod_files_spelling_ok").

  set_pod_parser
      my $object = Pod::Spell->new();
      set_pod_parser($object);

    By default Pod::Spell is used to generate text suitable for
    spellchecking from the input POD. If you want to use a different parser,
    perhaps a customized subclass of Pod::Spell, call "set_pod_parser" with
    an object that is-a Pod::Parser. Be sure to create a fresh parser object
    for each file (don't use this with "all_pod_files_spelling_ok").

  set_spell_cmd
      set_spell_cmd('hunspell -l'); # current preferred
      set_spell_cmd('aspell list');
      set_spell_cmd('spell');
      set_spell_cmd('ispell -l');

    If you want to force this module to use a particular spellchecker, then
    you can specify which one with "set_spell_cmd". This is useful to ensure
    a more consistent lexicon between developers, or if you have an unusual
    environment. Any command that takes text from standard input and prints
    a list of misspelled words, one per line, to standard output will do.
