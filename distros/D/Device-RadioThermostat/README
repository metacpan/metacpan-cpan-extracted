NAME
    Device::RadioThermostat - Access Radio Thermostat Co of America
    (3M-Filtrete) WiFi thermostats

SYNOPSIS
      use Device::RadioThermostat;
      my $thermostat = Device::RadioThermostat->new( address => "http://$ip");
      $thermostat->temp_cool(65);
      say "It is currently " . $thermostat->tstat()->{temp} "F inside.";

DESCRIPTION
    Device::RadioThermostat is a perl module for accessing the API of
    thermostats manufactured by Radio Thermostat Corporation of America.
    3M-Filtrete themostats with WiFi are OEM versions manufactured by RTCOA.

METHODS
    For additional information on the arguments and values returned see the
    RTCOA API documentation (pdf)
    <http://www.radiothermostat.com/documents/RTCOAWiFIAPIV1_3.pdf>.

  new( address=> 'http://192.168.1.1')
    Constructor takes named parameters. Currently only "address" which
    should be the HTTP URL for the thermostat.

  find_all(address1, address2)
    This finds all the thermostats in the address range and returns a
    reference to a hash which contains Device::RadioThermostat objects
    indexed by the device uuid. For example, it might return a structure as
    follows:

        Device::RadioThermostat->find_all("192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.254")

    returns

        {
        "5cdad4123456" => Device::RadioThermostat(address => 'http://192.168.1.76'),
        "5cdad4654321" => Device::RadioThermostat(address => 'http://192.168.1.183')
        }

  tstat
    Retrieve a hash of lots of info on the current thermostat state.
    Possible keys include: "temp", "tmode", "fmode", "override", "hold",
    "t_heat", "t_cool", "it_heat", "It_cool", "a_heat", "a_cool", "a_mode",
    "t_type_post", "t_state". For a description of their values see the
    RTCOA API documentation (pdf)
    <http://www.radiothermostat.com/documents/RTCOAWiFIAPIV1_3.pdf>.

  sys
    Retrieve a hash of lots of info on the current thermostat itself.
    Possible keys include: "uuid", "api_version", "fw_version",
    "wlan_fw_version". For a description of their values see the RTCOA API
    documentation (pdf)
    <http://www.radiothermostat.com/documents/RTCOAWiFIAPIV1_3.pdf>.

  model
    Retrieve a hash with information about the current thermostat model.
    Currently hash only has key "model".

  set_mode($mode)
    Takes a single integer argument for your desired mode. Values are 0 for
    off, 1 for heating, 2 for cooling, and 3 for auto.

  get_target
    Returns undef if current mode is off. Returns heat or cooling set point
    based on the current mode. If current mode is auto returns a reference
    to a two element array containing the cooling and heating set points.

  get_targets
    Returns a reference to a hash of the set points. Keys are "t_cool" and
    "t_heat".

  get_humidity
    Returns a reference to a hash containing current relative humidity (only
    supported by CT-80 Thermostats). Key is "humidity".

  temp_heat($temp)
    Set a temporary heating set point, takes one argument the desired
    target. Will also set current mode to heating.

  temp_cool($temp)
    Set a temporary cooling set point, takes one argument the desired
    target. Will also set current mode to cooling.

  remote_temp
    Returns a reference to a hash containing at least "rem_mode" but
    possibly also "rem_temp". When "rem_mode" is 1, the temperature passed
    to "set_remote_temp" is used instead of the thermostats internal temp
    sensor for thermostat operation.

    This can be used to have the thermostat act as if it was installed in a
    better location by feeding the temp from a sensor at that location to
    the thermostat periodically.

  set_remote_temp($temp)
    Takes a single value to set the current remote temp.

  disable_remote_temp
    Disables remote_temp mode and reverts to using the thermostats internal
    temp sensor.

  lock
  lock($mode)
    With mode specified, sets mode and returns false on failure. With
    successful mode change or no mode specified, returns the current mode.
    Mode is an integer, 0 - disabled, 1 - partial lock, 2 - full lock, 3 -
    utility lock.

  user_message($line, $message)
    Display a message on one of the two lines of alphanumeric display at the
    bottom of the thermostat. Valid values for line are 0 and 1. This is
    only supported by the CT-80 model thermostats. CT-80 Thermostat supports
    2 rows of alphanumeric strings of 26 characters in length.

  price_message($line, $message)
    Display a message in the price message area on the thermostat. Messages
    can be numeric plus decimal only. Valid values for line are 0 - 3.
    Multiple messages for different lines are rotated through. I believe
    line number used will cause an indicator for units to display based on
    the number used but it's not mentioned in the API docs and I'm not home
    currently.

    CT-80 model thermostats support displaying 2 alphanumeric strings of 6
    characters in length in the price message area.

  clear_message
    Clears the "price_message" area.

  clear_price_message
    Clears the "price_message" area.

  clear_user_message
    Clears the "user_message" area.

  datalog
    Returns individual run times for heating and cooling yesterday and
    today. This method isn't documented in the current API so it may go away
    in the future but does still work with the latest firmware. Sample data:

        $data = {
                  'today' => {
                             'cool_runtime' => { 'minute' => 29, 'hour' => 2 },
                             'heat_runtime' => { 'minute' => 0,  'hour' => 0 }
                           },
                  'yesterday' => {
                             'heat_runtime' => { 'minute' => 0,  'hour' => 0 },
                             'cool_runtime' => { 'minute' => 14, 'hour' => 0 }
                           }
                };

  get_uuid
    Returns the unique ID of the thermostat which is the MAC address. This
    helps distinguish thermostats when there are many on the same network.
