Installation
     Standard Module::Build process for building and installing modules:

       perl Build.PL
       ./Build
       ./Build test
       ./Build install

     Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
     the "./" notation, you can do this:

       perl Build.PL
       Build
       Build test
       Build install
