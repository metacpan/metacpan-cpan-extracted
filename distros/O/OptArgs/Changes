0.1.20 (2016-04-11)

    New Features:
        - None in this release but it might be worth you taking a look
          at the upcoming OptArgs2 for a cleaner and more flexible
          re-implementation.

    Authoring:
        - Clean up empty Changes entries

0.1.19_1 (2016-03-03)

    Enhancements:
        - New $OptArgs::PRINT_DEFAULT option for displaying default
          values in usage messages (Mario Domgoergen)
        - New $OptArgs::PRINT_ISA option for displaying option
          types in usage messages (Mario Domgoergen)

0.1.18 (2015-11-27)

    New Features:
        - Setting "default" to true on a Bool option causes it to
          appear as "--no-bool" in the usage. You will want to reverse
          the meaning of the "comment" if you use this feature.

    Enhancements:
        - App::optargs: don't require loaded class and application
          classes to be the same.
        - Remove some code duplication

0.1.16 (2014-10-01)

    API Changes:
        - The dispatch() function has been marked as depreciated,
          although it will remain in place for a while. The
          class_optargs() function should be used instead.

    New Features:
        - New class_optargs() function for more caller flexibility

0.1.14 (2014-06-16)

   Bug Fixes:
      - Support "command SUBCMD(with fallback) FALLBACK_ARG"

0.1.12 (2014-06-11)

    Enhancements:
       - Put POD back into .pm files; metacpan looks odd when separate.

    Bug Fixes:
       - Depend on Encode version 2.24 which should allow OptArgs to
         work on old versions of Perl on *BSD. Closes
         https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95888.
       - Generate Getopt::Args in Makefile.PL instead of in a Git
         commit hook which will work with the new release method.
         Closes https://github.com/mlawren/p5-OptArgs/issues/10.

0.1.10 (2014-05-07)

    Enhancements:
        - Enable build/run/test on MSWin32 environments
        - Small code cleanups

0.1.8 (2014-03-17)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Several "s/-/_/g" regex's were missing the final "g". Without
          the global replacement, sub commands that had more than one
          '-' in them would fail to be found during dispatch.  Closes
          https://github.com/mlawren/p5-OptArgs/issues/8.

0.1.6 (2014-02-13)

    Enhancements:
        - Program VERSION is displayed for help at top level

    Bug Fixes:
        - Don't index Getop::Args::Usage
        - Ensure default CODE refs are executed in arg/opt definition
          order. Closes https://github.com/mlawren/p5-OptArgs/issues/7.

0.1.4 (2013-12-23)

    Enhancements:
        - Add "[OPTIONS]" to usage line when options exist
        - Allow fallbacks to be hidden

    Bug Fixes:
        - Make App::optargs respect the value of $SORT
        - Ensure a fallback subcommand is also sorted according to $SORT
        - Sort option list according to $SORT

0.1.2 (2013-05-20)

    New Features:
        - Sub-commands can now be optionally abbreviated by setting
          $OptArgs::ABBREV (Thanks to Robbin Bonthond)
        - Sub-commands can now be optionally sorted by setting
          $OptArgs::SORT (Thanks to Robbin Bonthond)
        - (The above require a minor version number upgrade)

    Enhancements:
        - Document colourized output behaviour
        - Improved usage output: simpler colour scheme, more info
        - Improved tests

    Bug Fixes:
        - Do not assume consistent hash key order in tests
        - Do not count negative Int/Num arguments as unknown options

0.0.4 (2012-08-21)

    New Features:
        - Convert HASHrefs to options in dispatch()

    Enhancements:
        - Greater flexibility for "fallback" sub-commands.

    Bug Fixes:
        - Stop adding sub-command key/values to the optargs hashref

0.0.3 (2012-08-04)

    API Changes:
        - "subcmd" now requires a HASH like "opt" and "arg"

    New Features:
        - New "hidden" parameter for subcmd()

    Enhancements:
        - Better check for utf8 aware environment in tests

0.0.2 (2012-07-31)

    Enhancements:
        - Make hidden options visible when when help is requested.
        - Duplicate OptArgs as Getopt::Args

    Bug Fixes:
        - None.

0.0.1 (2012-07-30)

    Initial Release.
