NAME

    CPAN::Recent::Uploads - Find the distributions recently uploaded to
    CPAN

VERSION

    version 0.14

SYNOPSIS

      use CPAN::Recent::Uploads;
    
      my $weekago = time() - ( 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 );
    
      my @uploads = CPAN::Recent::Uploads->recent( $weekago );
    
      # as a one liner (seeing the weeks worth of uploads).
    
      perl -MCPAN::Recent::Uploads -le 'print for CPAN::Recent::Uploads->recent;'

DESCRIPTION

    CPAN::Recent::Uploads provides a mechanism for obtaining a list of the
    RECENT uploads to CPAN as determined from the files produced by
    File::Rsync::Mirror::Recentfile that exist in the authors/ directory on
    CPAN.

FUNCTIONS

    recent

      Takes two optional arguments. The first argument is an epoch time you
      wish to find the uploads since. If it is not supplied the default is
      the current time minus one week. The second argument is the URL of a
      CPAN mirror you wish to query. If it is not supplied then
      http://www.cpan.org/ is used.

      In a list context it returns a list of uploaded distributions ordered
      by the time they were uploaded (ie. oldest first, increasing in
      recentness ).

      In a scalar context it returns a hash reference keyed on distribution
      with the values being the epoch time that that distribution entered
      CPAN.
