0.12 2015-08-29
 - Add support for passing infinity, negative infinity, and NaN arguments to all
   formatting methods (format, at_least, range) on all formatting classes
   (decimal, percent, currency), because those are valid numeric values in Perl,
   which are now all localized even though it doesn’t always make
   sense [issue #26]
 - Add `infinity` and `nan` attributes to all classes in addition to the decimal
   formatter

0.11 2015-08-25
 - Upgrade CLDR data from v24 (2013-09-18) to v27.0.1 (2015-03-30) [issue #33]
 - Add bin/generate-cldr-data.pl script to update Perl data from CLDR JSON
 - Add new locales including dsb (Lower Sorbian), fy (West Frisian),
   hsb (Upper Sorbian), lb (Luxembourgish), qu (Quechua), smn (Inari Sami),
   and ug (Uyghur)
 - Remove CLDR data with draft status of 'provisional' or 'unconfirmed', only
   including 'contributed' or 'approved', which is the same threshold as the
   ICU Project as well as the CLDR JSON data as of v27.0.1
 - Remove 'provisional' draft numbering systems until they become at least
   'contributed': brah (Brahmi), cakm (Chakma), osma (Osmanya), shrd (Sharada),
   sora (Sora Sompeng), takr (Takri)
 - Change various symbols for several locales, including grouping symbol in
   es (Spanish, not including Latin American Spanish locales) from
   ' ' (no-break space) to '.' (full stop) and fr-SH (Swiss French) from
   "'" (apostrophe) to ' ' (no-break space)
 - Change negative number format for any locales using formats with parentheses
   like '(N)', including ko (Korean), to using the minus sign like '-N', except
   for accounting format which is not yet supported
 - Change currency decimal symbol for sv (Swedish) from ':' to ',' now matching
   the regular (non-currency) decimal symbol and common usage, resulting in no
   locale having a different decimal symbol for currencies
 - Change THB (Thai Baht) symbol from '฿' to 'THB' for most locales including
   root and th (Thai), due to its general obscurity
 - Change many other currency symbols for many locales, but generally minor
   changes, for example DKK (Danish Krone) in da (Danish) from 'kr' to 'kr.' and
   USD (US Dollar) in fr-CA (Canadian French) from '$US' to '$ US'
 - Change CLF (Chilean Unit of Account (UF)) currency fraction digits
   from 0 to 4
 - Change CZK (Czech Republic Koruna) currency cash fraction digits from 2 to 0
   with default fraction digits remaining 2
 - Change HUF (Hungarian Forint) currency fraction digits from 0 to 2 with
   cash fraction digits remaining 0
 - Change UYI (Uruguayan Peso (Indexed Units)) currency fraction digits
   from 2 to 0

 - Add class name to uninitialized value warnings [issue #22]

0.04 2014-01-21
 - Implement currency spacing rules from CLDR spec: when a non-symbol character
   in the currency sign would touch a digit, add a space between them,
   e.g. CHF 1.99 instead of CHF1.99 [issue #7]
 - Use private-use characters U+F8F0–U+F8F4 internally as placeholders,
   which makes them unavailable for use in patterns and signs [issue #24]

   variables [issue #25]
