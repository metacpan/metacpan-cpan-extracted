ABSTRACT

    Passwd::Unix provides an abstract object-oriented and function
    interface to standard Unix files, such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow,
    /etc/group. Additionally this module provides environment for testing
    software without using system critical files in /etc/ dir (you can
    specify other files than /etc/passwd etc.).

DESCRIPTION

    The Passwd::Unix module provides an abstract interface to /etc/passwd,
    /etc/shadow, /etc/group, /etc/gshadow format files. It is inspired by
    Unix::PasswdFile module (that one does not handle /etc/shadow file).

    Module was rewritten from the ground in version 1.0 (i.e. to support
    newer hash algorithms and so on), however with compatibility in mind.
    Despite this some incompatibilities can occur.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

    new( [ param0 = 1, param1 => 0... ] )>

      Constructor. Possible parameters are:

      passwd - path to passwd file; default /etc/passwd

      shadow - path to shadow file; default /etc/shadow

      group - path to group file; default /etc/group

      gshadow - path to gshadow file if any; default /etc/gshadow

      algorithm - hash algorithm, possible values: md5, blowfish, sha256,
      sha512; default sha512

      umask - not used anymore; left only for compatibility reason

      debug - not used anymore; left only for compatibility reason

      backup - boolean; if set to 1, backup will be made; default 1

      compress - boolean; if set to 1, backup compression will be made;
      default 1

      warnings - boolean; if set to 1, important warnings will be
      displayed; default 0

    algorithm()

      This method allows to specify algorithm for password generation.
      Possible values: md5, blowfish, sha256, sha512

    backup()

      This method allows to specify if backups files have to be made before
      every modyfication (1 for on, 0 for off).

    compress()

      This method allows to specify if compression to backup files has to
      be made (1 for on, 0 for off).

    check_sanity()

      This function was left only for compatibility reason. Currently it
      does nothing (always returns 1).

    debug()

      This function was left only for compatibility reason. Currently it
      does nothing.

    default_umask( [UMASK] )

      This function was left only for compatibility reason. Currently it
      does nothing.

    del( USERNAME0, USERNAME1... )

      This method is an alias for del_user. It's for transition only.

    del_user( USERNAME0, USERNAME1... )

      This method will delete the list of users. It has no effect if the
      supplied users do not exist.

    del_group( GROUPNAME0, GROUPNAME1... )

      This method will delete the list of groups. It has no effect if the
      supplied groups do not exist.

    encpass( PASSWORD )

      This method will encrypt plain text into unix style password.

    error()

      This method returns the last error (even if "warnings" is disabled).

    exists_user(USERNAME)

      This method checks if specified user exists. It returns undef on
      failure and 1 on success.

    exists_group(GROUPNAME)

      This method checks if specified group exists. It returns undef on
      failure and 1 on success.

    gecos( USERNAME [,GECOS] )

      Read or modify a user's GECOS string (typically full name). Returns
      the result of operation (1 or undef) if GECOS was specified.
      Otherwhise returns the GECOS if any.

    gid( USERNAME [,GID] )

      Read or modify a user's GID. Returns the result of operation (1 or
      undef) if GID was specified otherwhise returns the GID if any.

    group( GROUPNAME [,GID, ARRAYREF] )

      This method can add, modify, or return information about a group.
      Supplied with a single groupname parameter, it will return a two
      element list consisting of (GID, ARRAYREF), where ARRAYREF is a ref
      to array consisting names of users in this GROUP. It will return
      undef and ref to empty array (undef, [ ]) if no such group exists. If
      you supply all three parameters, the named group will be created or
      modified if it already exists.

    group_file([PATH])

      This method, if called with an argument, sets path to the group file.
      Otherwise returns the current PATH.

    groups()

      This method returns a list of all existing groups.

    groups_from_gshadow()

      This method returns a list of all existing groups in a gshadow file.

    gshadow_file([PATH])

      This method, if called with an argument, sets path to the gshadow
      file. Otherwise returns the current PATH.

    home( USERNAME [,HOMEDIR] )

      Read or modify a user's home directory. Returns the result of
      operation (1 or undef) if HOMEDIR was specified otherwhise returns
      the HOMEDIR if any.

    maxuid( )

      This method returns the maximum UID in use.

    maxgid()

      This method returns the maximum GID in use.

    minuid( [UID] )

      This method returns the minimum UID in use, that is greater then
      spupplied.

    mingid()

      This method returns the minimum GID in use, that is greater then
      spupplied.

    passwd( USERNAME [,PASSWD] )

      Read or modify a user's password. If you have a plaintext password,
      use the encpass method to encrypt it before passing it to this
      method. Returns the result of operation (1 or undef) if PASSWD was
      specified. Otherwhise returns the PASSWD if any.

    passwd_file([PATH])

      This method, if called with an argument, sets path to the passwd
      file. Otherwise returns the current PATH.

    rename( OLDNAME, NEWNAME )

      This method changes the username for a user. If NEWNAME corresponds
      to an existing user, that user will be overwritten. It returns undef
      on failure and 1 on success.

    reset()

      This method sets paths to files passwd, shadow, group, gshadow to the
      default values.

      exists.

    users()

      This method returns a list of all existing usernames.

    users_from_shadow()

      This method returns a list of all existing usernames in a shadow
      file.
