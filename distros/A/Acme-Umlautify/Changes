Revision history for Perl extension Acme::Umlautify.

1.07  2014/03/16

	Moving to UTF (as opposed to Latin-1) thanks to an emailed suggestion
		by Jeremy Mates <jmates@uw.edu> - this literally allows the
		addition of umlatus to everything, including spaces.

	Almost concurrently, Nick Wellnhofer <nwellnhof@cpan.org> opened 
		RT #93530 which suggested a UTF solution to the lack of
		umlauts for Latin lower-case y.

	Added a terminology section to the documentation.
