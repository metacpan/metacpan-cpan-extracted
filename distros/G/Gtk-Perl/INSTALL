To install Gtk-Perl-0.7005:

First install the Gtk part of the package by executing the following
commands at your shell:

   $ tar -xvzf Gtk-Perl-0.7005.tar.gz
   $ cd Gtk-Perl-0.7005
   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make install 

   *** NOTE *** : The 'make install' step may need to be performed as user root.

Starting with version 0.7005 the toplevel makefile tries to autodetect
what modules can be compiled on your system and will do that for you
taking into account any dependencies between the modules. This means that
if you have all the developement packages installed, the above steps will
compile Perl support for all the "stable" modules. If you know better, read on.

If you want to disable autodetection, use the flag --without-guessing:

	perl Makefile.PL --without-guessing

This will compile the main Gtk module only.
You may disable autodetection of any submodule with the --without-module switch,
where module is one on the submodule tags:

	gdkimlib, gtkglarea, gdkpixbuf, gtkhtml, gnome, gnomeprint, applets, glade

You may force the compilation of a misdetected submodule with the --with-module-force switch,
where module is one of the submodule tags above.

To install any of the optional modules such as Glade, Gnome, GdkImlib,
GtkGLArea, GtkHTML, Mozilla, Bonobo or GtkXmHTML at a later time do the following:

   cd <module>           ( Where <module> is the name of the module
                           you wish to compile and install ).
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install 

   *** NOTE *** : The 'make install' step may need be performed as user root.

Repeat the above steps for each of the modules you wish to install on 
your system.

Note that support for panel applets has moved in his own submodule an is no longer
compiled in the Gnome module with the --panel-applet switch. Compile the applets
submodule instead (directory Applet).

  *** NOTE *** : GdkImlib MUST be compiled and installed BEFORE Gnome 
                 support may be installed. Please make sure you install 
                 GdkImlib first to make sure your Gnome support gets 
                 installed correctly.  

If your system supports it, you can try to use the LD version script (ldscript) to
improve the loading time of the module: the script will instruct the linker to
make fewer symbols shared in the shared module, speeding up the dynamic linker.
When you compile, simply set the LDDLFLAGS make variable:

	make LDDLFLAGS="--shared -Wl,--version-script=`pwd`/ldscript"

This works on modern Linux systems and should work also on Solaris.
