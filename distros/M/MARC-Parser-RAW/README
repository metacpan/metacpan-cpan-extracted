NAME

    MARC::Parser::RAW - Parser for ISO 2709 encoded MARC records

SYNOPSIS

        use MARC::Parser::RAW;
    
        my $parser = MARC::Parser::RAW->new( $file );
    
        while ( my $record = $parser->next() ) {
            # do something        
        }

DESCRIPTION

    MARC::Parser::RAW is a lightweight, fault tolerant parser for ISO 2709
    encoded MARC records. Tags, indicators and subfield codes are not
    validated against the MARC standard. Record length from leader and
    field lengths from the directory are ignored. Records with a faulty
    structure will be skipped with a warning. The resulting data structure
    is optimized for usage with the Catmandu data tool kit.

    MARC::Parser::RAW expects UTF-8 encoded files as input. Otherwise
    provide a filehande with a specified I/O layer or specify encoding.

MARC

    The MARC record is parsed into an ARRAY of ARRAYs:

        $record = [
                [ 'LDR', undef, undef, '_', '00661nam  22002538a 4500' ],
                [ '001', undef, undef, '_', 'fol05865967 ' ],
                ...
                [   '245', '1', '0', 'a', 'Programming Perl /',
                    'c', 'Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen & Jon Orwant.'
                ],
                ...
            ];
