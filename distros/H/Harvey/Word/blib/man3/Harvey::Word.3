.IX Title "Word 3"
.TH Word 3 "perl v5.6.1" "2002-02-06" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.UC
.SH "NAME"
Harvey::Word \- Perl extension for creating word objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&  use Harvey::Word;
\&  my $W = Word->new("grape");
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    Word object module for Harvey.  Looks up information on
\&    a word for all forms and gives information to calling objects.
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&    Version 1.02 Overhauled and improved word.txt/word.db database.
\&    Added better cross referencing to move between verb, noun, adj and
\&    adverb forms.
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.Vb 2
\&  The purpose of the Word module is to create Word objects that can be 
\&  queried for syntactic information about the word.
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&    Version 1.01, words can be queried for their dictionary form, part 
\&    of speech, many attributes on the basis of the part of speech, 
\&    frequency, what persons are possible, i.e. 1st singular, 3rd plural, 
\&    etc., and the likeliest parts of speech that the word could be based 
\&    on the frequencies in the BNC.
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&    Most methods which return a characteristic of the word can also be 
\&    used to turn on or off the characteristic by passing a 0 or 1 for
\&    boolean flags, text for text queries and numbers for the frequency.
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&    The data is used from a TIE hash database, but can be exported/imported
\&    from the ASCII file word.txt using the export_word and import_word 
\&    functions.
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&  The following methods are supported:
.Ve
.Vb 104
\&    new:        Constructor.
\&    text:       Get the text of the word. Version 1.02 - added the ability
\&                to pass in a standard expression for pattern matching
\&                against the text of the object, in which case a boolean
\&                is returned.
\&    load_tie:   Load a word record from the TIE hash (%t_word) into the 
\&                memory hash (%word). Done automatically from the constructor.
\&    prioritize: Returns an ordered array of the most likely parts of speech
\&                for a given word based on the BNC frequency counts.
\&    choice:     Returns an array of strings of the most likely POS choices 
\&                for a word object based on BNC freqeuncy counts.
\&    noun:       Retuns the noun flags if the word is a noun, otherwise 0.  Can
\&                be used as a boolean test for whether the word can be a noun, 
\&                but also can set or retieve the noun flags for a word, which are
\&                stored as bytes in an integer.  To set the flags, send in an 
\&                integer as the argument.

\&    noun_dictionary:    Get/set dictionary form for a noun, ie. singular.
\&    verb_dictionary:    Get/set dictionary form for a verb, ie. infinitive,
\&                        1.02 added argument to verb_dictionary.  Pass in
\&                        the verb part (Present|Past|Third|Infinitive|Gerrund

\&    pronoun_persons:    Returns the possible persons for a pronoun.
\&    verb_persons:       Returns the possible persons for a verb.
\&    modal_persons:  Added with 1.02 since modals have slightly different

\&                    while can as a verb does not.
\&    tie_hash:   Ties the hash, %t_word to the file dic/word.db. 
\&    import_word:        Builds the hash TIE file 'dic/word.db' from
\&                        the text file 'word.txt'.
\&    export_word:        Exports data from the TIE file 'dic/word.db'
