This is the Perl distribution MooseX-Types-Path-Tiny.

Installing MooseX-Types-Path-Tiny is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny

If it does not have permission to install modules to the current perl, cpanm
will automatically set up and install to a local::lib in your home directory.
See the local::lib documentation (https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib) for
details on enabling it in your environment.

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build && ./Build test

Then install it:

    % ./Build install

If your perl is system-managed, you can create a local::lib in your home
directory to install modules to. For details, see the local::lib documentation:
https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib

## Documentation

MooseX-Types-Path-Tiny documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny
