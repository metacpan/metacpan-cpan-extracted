NAME
    `overload::substr' - overload Perl's `substr()' function

SYNOPSIS
     package My::Stringlike::Object;

     use overload::substr;

     sub _substr
     {
        my $self = shift;
        if( @_ > 2 ) {
           $self->replace_substr( @_ );
        }
        else {
           return $self->get_substr( @_ );
        }
     }

     ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows an object class to overload the `substr' core
    function, which Perl's `overload' pragma does not allow by itself.

    It is invoked similarly to the `overload' pragma, being passed a single
    named argument which should be a code reference or method name to
    implement the `substr' function.

     use overload::substr substr => \&SUBSTR;

     use overload::substr substr => "SUBSTR";

    The referred method will be invoked as per core's `substr'; namely, it
    will take the string to be operated on (which will be an object in this
    case), an offset, optionally a length, and optionally a replacement.

     $str->SUBSTR( $offset );
     $str->SUBSTR( $offset, $length );
     $str->SUBSTR( $offset, $length, $replacement );

    In each case, whatever it returns will be the return value of the
    `substr' function that invoked it.

    If the `substr' argument is not provided, it defaults to a method called
    `_substr'.

    It is not required that the return value be a plain string; any Perl
    value may be returned unmodified from the `substr' method, or passed in
    as the value of the replacement. This allows objects to behave in
    whatever way is deemed most appropriate.

TODO
    *       More testing - edge cases, especially in LVALUE logic.

    *       Test for memory leaks, especially in LVALUE logic.

    *       Look into / implement fixup of substr() ops compiled before
            module is loaded

    *       Consider if implementations of split(), and `m//' and `s///'
            regexps should be done that also uses the overloaded substr()
            method.

    With thanks to Matt S Trout <mst@shadowcat.co.uk> for suggesting the
    possibility, and Joshua ben Jore <jjore@cpan.org> for the inspiration by
    way of UNIVERSAL::ref.
