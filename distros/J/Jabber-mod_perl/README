Jabber::mod_perl is an embedded interpreter in the session manager of jabberd2 (sm daemon).
This allows the user to insert arbitrary perl code (in the form of loaded modules) in to the
processing chain of the session manager, in a similar fashion to mod_perl for Apache.

Because the XML processing of j2 is all based on NADs (Not A DOM), then you need to deal with their peculiarity, and API.  For details of this have a look at the jabberd2 documentation at http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/docs/, and the POD documentation included in this distribution for Jabber::NAD.

First of all you need to get hold of the jabberd2 source code, as this needs to 
be patched to include mod_perl.c in the build.

Also check that you have:
 - Cyrus SASL 2
     ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/
 - OpenSSL (0.9.6e or higher)
     http://www.openssl.org/news/
 - Berkeley DB 4.1
     http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html
 - autoconf 2.50+
     http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html
 - automake 1.4+
     http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html
 - libtool 1.4+
     http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html

Get a source code release candidate for the jabberd2 from:
  http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/jabberd2/project/view.php
and unpack it - something like this: tar -xzvf Jabber-mod_perl-0.03.tar.gz

OR: 

You can get the latest jabberd2 source code by checking it out of cvs on jabberstudio.org like this:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@jabberstudio.org:/home/cvs co jabberd2

( remember to login to cvs first like this: cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@jabberstudio.org:/home/cvs login )

this will give you a directory jabberd2 in the directory that you are currently sitting in.
After this you should unpack this distribution next to it giving you two adjacent directories -
./jabberd-2.x.x-ax ( or ./jabberd2 from cvs ) and ./Jabber-mod_perl-x.xx


Change into the Jabber-mod_perl-x.xx directory and then do the -

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make test
make install <- do not do this if you want to test things first - see below

Dance.

perl Makefile.PL will prompt you for the location of jabberd2 (if the above went according to plan
then the default should suffice ), and then you will be asked for configuration parameters to be
passed to ./configure for the build of jabberd2.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
perl Makefile.PL will do the the entire configure and build for jabberd2 so don't forget to run make
for Jabber::mod_perl.  It also changes the configuration files inorder to facilitate the build of jadperl,
including copying source files to the correct locations.


Once you have built Jabber::mod_perl - this should have compiled jabberd2 for you successfully.  You still
need to change to the jabberd2 directory (cd ../jabberd2 ), and make install here to install the server.
When the server is installed change to the server config directory (cd $PREFIX/etc/jabberd) and amend the 
sm.xml config file to activate mod_perl - eg:

 ......
    <!-- pkt-sm receives packets from the router that are addressed directly to the sm host (no user) -->
    <chain id='pkt-sm'>
      <module>iq-last</module>      <!-- return the server uptime -->
      <module>iq-time</module>      <!-- return the current server time -->
      <module>iq-version</module>   <!-- return the server name and version -->
      <module>echo</module>         <!-- echo messages sent to /echo -->
      <module arg='Some::Handler1 MyEcho'>mod_perl</module>     <!-- mod_perl handler activated here -->
    </chain>
.....
  </modules>

Another example:
    <chain id='in-sess'>
		...
      <module>presence</module>         <!-- process and distribute presence updates -->
      <module arg='MyStamp'>mod_perl</module>     <!-- mod_perl handler activated here -->
      <module>deliver</module>          <!-- deliver packets with full jids directly -->
		...
    </chain>

The above examples correspond to the Perl packages found in examples/* in this distribution.


Testing/Making it all run
=========================

The above handler modules are located in the examples directory of this distribution.
When running the session manager - you must make sure the Perl can find any module
that it is attempting to load.  I typically do this by setting the PERL5LIB 
environment variable to include the appropriate paths - eg:

export PERL5LIB=path/to/mod_perl/examples
/path/to/jabberd/bin/sm -D > /path/to/jabberd/sm.log 2>&1 &

Or something similar.

look at the two scripts in the tools/ directory (start and stop) as an example
of how to control this with a little less pain :-).

Make sure that you watch the sm.log file, as this will alert you to any problems regarding loading 
modules etc.
