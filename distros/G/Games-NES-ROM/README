NAME
    Games::NES::ROM - View information about an NES game from a ROM file

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::NES::ROM;
    
        # Read in the ROM without having to know its format
        my $rom = Games::NES::ROM->load( 'file.nes' );

        # Specifically read in an iNES file
        $rom = Games::NES::ROM::INES->new( filename => 'file.nes' );

        # Access the details
        print 'PRG Banks: ', $rom->prg_count, "\n";
        print 'CHR Banks: ', $rom->prg_count, "\n";
        # etc...
    
        # View the SHA-1 & CRC checksums
        print 'SHA1: ', $rom->sha1, "\n";
        print ' CRC: ', $rom->crc, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module loads the details of an NES rom file. It is primarily meant
    to be used a base class for more specific file formats. Those formats
    include:

    *   Universal NES Image File (UNIF)

    *   iNES

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

METHODS
  load( $filename )
    Attemps to read the ROM structure into memory using all available file
    formats until success.

  prg_count( )
    Returns the number of PRG banks for this ROM.

  chr_count( )
    Returns the number of CHR banks for this ROM.

  sha1( )
    Returns the SHA-1 checksum for the PRG and CHR data.

  crc( )
    Returns the CRC checksum for the PRG and CHR data.

  sprite( $chr_bank, $index )
    Returns the raw (composite) sprite in the specified CHR bank at the
    specified array index.

BASE ATTRIBUTES
    The following base attributes are available for all file formats:

    *   filename - The filename from which data was loaded

    *   id - A string found at the beginning of a file to identify the file
        format

    *   title - The game's title, if available

    *   prg_banks - An arrayref of PRG bank data

    *   chr_banks - An arrayref of CHR bank data

    *   has_sram - Boolean value to determine if the ROM is battery backed

    *   mapper - A value indicating what memory mapper to use with the ROM

    *   mirroring - A value indicating what time of mirroring is used in the
        ROM

  NOTES
    *   mapper - iNES uses integer IDs, UNIF uses string IDs

    *   mirroring - An integer ID, using the UNIF list as a basis

    Each file format will have an extended set of attributes specific to its
    data structure. Please consult their documentation for more information.
