This is alpha release 0.03 of Term::Size::ReadKey.

Term::Size::ReadKey is a Perl module which provides a straightforward 
way to get the size of the terminal (or window) on which 
a script is running. It does this via the module Term::ReadKey
preserving the interface of the original Tim Goodwin's 
Term::Size module.
