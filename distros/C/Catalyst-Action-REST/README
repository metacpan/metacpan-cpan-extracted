NAME

    Catalyst::Action::REST - Automated REST Method Dispatching

SYNOPSIS

        sub foo :Local :ActionClass('REST') {
          ... do setup for HTTP method specific handlers ...
        }
    
        sub foo_GET {
          ... do something for GET requests ...
        }
    
        # alternatively use an Action
        sub foo_PUT : Action {
          ... do something for PUT requests ...
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This Action handles doing automatic method dispatching for REST
    requests. It takes a normal Catalyst action, and changes the dispatch
    to append an underscore and method name. First it will try dispatching
    to an action with the generated name, and failing that it will try to
    dispatch to a regular method.

    For example, in the synopsis above, calling GET on "/foo" would result
    in the foo_GET method being dispatched.

    If a method is requested that is not implemented, this action will
    return a status 405 (Method Not Found). It will populate the "Allow"
    header with the list of implemented request methods. You can override
    this behavior by implementing a custom 405 handler like so:

       sub foo_not_implemented {
          ... handle not implemented methods ...
       }

    If you do not provide an _OPTIONS subroutine, we will automatically
    respond with a 200 OK. The "Allow" header will be populated with the
    list of implemented request methods. If you do not provide an _HEAD
    either, we will auto dispatch to the _GET one in case it exists.

    It is likely that you really want to look at
    Catalyst::Controller::REST, which brings this class together with
    automatic Serialization of requests and responses.

    When you use this module, it adds the Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST
    role to your request class.

METHODS

    dispatch

      This method overrides the default dispatch mechanism to the
      re-dispatching mechanism described above.

SEE ALSO

    You likely want to look at Catalyst::Controller::REST, which implements
    a sensible set of defaults for a controller doing REST.

    This class automatically adds the Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST
    role to your request class. If you're writing a web application which
    provides RESTful responses and still needs to accommodate web browsers,
    you may prefer to use Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers
    instead.

    Catalyst::Action::Serialize, Catalyst::Action::Deserialize

TROUBLESHOOTING

    Q: I'm getting a "415 Unsupported Media Type" error. What gives?!

      A: Most likely, you haven't set Content-type equal to
      "application/json", or one of the accepted return formats. You can do
      this by setting it in your query accepted return formats. You can do
      this by setting it in your query string thusly:
      ?content-type=application%2Fjson (where %2F == / uri escaped).

      NOTE Apache will refuse %2F unless configured otherwise. Make sure
      AllowEncodedSlashes On is in your httpd.conf file in order for this
      to run smoothly.
