DESCRIPTION
    A mixin class for vlan related infos from the dot1qVlanStaticTable
    within the Q-BRIDGE-MIB. The mixin-module provides methods for mapping
    between vlan-ids and vlan-names und relations between bridge-ports and
    vlan-ids, tagged or untagged on these ports.

MIXIN METHODS
  OBJ->map_vlan_static_ids2names()
    Returns a hash reference with statically configured vlan-ids as keys and
    the corresponing vlan-names as values:

      {
        vlan_id => vlan_name,
        vlan_id => vlan_name,
        ... ,
      }

  OBJ->map_vlan_static_ids2ports()
    Returns a hash reference with the vlan-ids as keys and tagged and
    untagged port-lists as values:

      {
        vlan_id => {
          tagged   => [port_list],
          untagged => [port_list],
        },

        vlan_id => {
          tagged   => [port_list],
          untagged => [port_list],
        },

        ... ,
      }

  OBJ->map_vlan_static_ports2ids()
    Returns a hash reference with the bridge-ports as keys and tagged and
    untagged vlan-ids as values:

      {
        bridge_port => {
          tagged   => [vlan_id_list],
          untagged => [vlan_id_list],
        },

        bridge_port => {
          tagged   => [vlan_id_list],
          untagged => [vlan_id_list],
        },

        ... ,
      }

INITIALIZATION
  OBJ->_init($reload)
    Fetch basic Dot1Q Vlan related snmp values from the host. Don't call
    this method direct!

PRIVATE METHODS
    Only for developers or maintainers.

  _fetch_dot1d_base_num_ports($session)
    Fetch dot1dBaseNumPorts from the dot1dBase group once during object
    initialization.

  _dot1d_base_num_ports_cb($session)
    The callback for _fetch_dot1d_base_num_ports.

  _fetch_dot1q_vlan_static_tbl_entries()
    Fetch the vlan tag info for current vlans.

  _dot1q_vlan_static_tbl_entries_cb($session)
    The callback for _fetch_dot1q_vlan_static_tbl_entries_cb.

    dot1dBasePorts.
