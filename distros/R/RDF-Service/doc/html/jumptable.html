      The RDF::Service jumptables

    <h1>The RDF::Service jumptables</h1>

    <p>Every Interface has a hash tree that says, for each namespace and
      type, what methods it support.</p>

    <p>Each node node has a customized jumptable selectd from a
      jumpjumptable of jumptables.  The jumptable connects each method
      name with a list of subroutine reference collected from the
      connected interfaces.  The key used in the selection of a jumptable
      consists of three parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A orderd list of connected interfaces; the IDS</li>
      <li>A orderd list of domain prefixes</li>
      <li>A orderd list of types</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A jumptable that doesn't exist gets created on demand.  Nodes not
      used for method calls never needs a jumptable.</p>



    <h2>Circular dependencies</h2>

    <p>The jumptable depends on the list of types. But in order to
      determine the list of types for a specific Resource, you have to
      call init_types(), which will be called from the jumptable.  This
      situation is resolved by temporary setting the Resource type list to
      RDFS:Resouce.  A temporary jumptable gets created and init_types
      gets called.  The jumptable will at least know which interfaces that
      handles the specific resource, based on its URI.  The init_types()
      must be located in the RDFS:Resouce section.  After the types has
      been initiated, the original call will be dispatched.</p>
    
    <p>The internal method declare_add_types() (that is called by the
      interfaces implementations of init_types()) will need to call
      init_props() (that initialize all the nodes properties) for each
      class in order to find subClassOf properties.  That will lead to
      infinite recursions for some top classes. RDFS:Resource never gets a
      chanse to define it's types since init_types() calls init_props()
      for itself.  this has been resolved by skipping the subClassOf calls
      for RDFS:Literal, RDFS:Resource and RDF:Statement; ie all the type
      of nodes that are created by the init_props() process.  (I not yet
      fully understands what happens here.)</p>
