        - the Authorization header is now set only on specific requests, not on

        - an abort is now issued on bogus paragraphs and non-contiguous use of
          a client id; we can roll this back in the future if someone has a
          need… but why would you?
        - Set sentences now have an assert_no_errors method that throws a
          error-dumping abort if any part of the setFoos method did not succeed
        - paragraphs now have a client_id method
        - $set->VERB_errors now always returns an empty hashref if there are
          errors, even if the server returned nothing or null
