NAME
    install.pod - how to install WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord

SYNOPSIS
     perl Makefile.PL

     make

     make test

     make install

DESCRIPTION
  Prerequisites
    You need to have WordNet (version 1.7.1 or later, 2.0 preferred),
    WordNet::QueryData (version 1.30 or later), WordNet::Similarity (latest
    version preferred), XML::Parser (version 2.34 or later) installed.
    Optionally, you should also have Gtk+ (version 1.2.x) and Gtk::Perl
    installed, to be able to use the graphical interfaces provided.

    WordNet is available at http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

    WordNet::QueryData is available from
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-QueryData/

    WordNet::Similarity is available from
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity/

    XML::Parser is available from http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Parser/

    Gtk is available from http://www.gtk.org/

    Gtk::Perl is available from http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gtk-Perl/

    You should set the WNHOME environment variable to the location where you
    have WordNet installed; see the WordNet::QueryData documentation for
    more information.

  Installing
    The usual way to install the package is to run the following commands:

     perl Makefile.PL

     make

     make test

     make install

    If you can't set the WNHOME environment variable, you can use the WNHOME
    option when running perl Makefile.PL. For example,

     perl Makefile.PL WNHOME=/usr/local/WordNet-2.0

    You will often need root access/superuser priviledges to run
    make install. The module can also be installed locally. To do a local
    install, you need to specify a PREFIX option when you run 'perl
    Makefile.PL'. For example,

     perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/sid

    or

     perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/sid/lib PREFIX=/home/sid

    will install Similarity into /home/sid. The first method above will
    install the modules in /home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 (assuming you
    are using version 5.8.3 of Perl; otherwise, the directory will be
    slightly different). The second method will install the modules in
    /home/sid/lib. In either case the executable scripts will be installed
    in /home/sid/bin and the man pages will be installed in /home/sid/share.

    In your Perl programs that you may write using the modules, you may need
    to add a line like so

     use lib '/home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3';

    if you used the first method or

     use lib '/home/sid/lib';

    if you used the second method. By doing this, the installed modules are
    found by your program. To run the similarity.pl program, you would need
    to do

     perl -I/home/sid/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3 similarity.pl

    or

     perl -I/home/sid/lib

    Of course, you could also add the 'use lib' line to the top of the
    program yourself. You will need to replace 5.8.3 with whatever version
    of Perl you are using. The preceeding instructions should be sufficient
    for standard and slightly non-standard installations. However, if you
    need to modify other makefile options you should look at the
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker documentation. Modifying other makefile options is
    not recommended unless you really, absolutely, and completely know what
    you're doing!

    Alternatively, you could also set the PERL5LIB environment variable to
    indicate the location of the Perl modules.

    NOTE: If one (or more) of the tests run by 'make test' fails, you will
    see a summary of the tests that failed, followed by a message of the
    form "make: *** [test_dynamic] Error Y" where Y is a number between 1
    and 255 (inclusive). If the number is less than 255, then it indicates
    how many test failed (if more than 254 tests failed, then 254 will still
    be shown). If one or more tests died, then 255 will be shown. For more
    details, see:

    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Builder.pm#EXIT_CODES

  System Requirements
    1.  Perl version 5.6 or later. This package has been written in Perl,
        which is freely available from www.perl.org. This package assumes
        that Perl is installed in the directory /usr/local/bin. If this is
        where Perl is on your computer, then the support programs can be run
        directly at the command line as 'disamb.pl ...' or 'wps2sk.pl...',
        etc. However, if Perl is not installed at this location, you would
        need to explicitly invoke them as 'perl disamb.pl ... ' or 'perl
        wps2sk.pl...', etc.

    2.  WordNet: The modules are based on WordNet. WordNet must be installed
        on your system. WordNet is freely downloadable from
        http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/. WordNet version 2.0 was used
        during the development and testing of the package; however, it
        should work with other versions of WordNet as well. The
        WordNet::QueryData Perl module is used to access WordNet. This
        module requires that an environment variable 'WNHOME', containing
        the path to the WordNet files, be set up. For further details,
        please see the WordNet::QueryData documentation.

    3.  WordNet::QueryData: This is the Perl interface to WordNet written by
        Jason Rennie. QueryData should be accessible on the @INC path of
        Perl. (Can be freely downloaded from
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-QueryData/). QueryData 1.31 was
        used during the development. Also we observed that that due to some
        major changes in QueryData from its previous versions, this software
        does not work with the earlier versions of QueryData. If you have an
        earlier version of QueryData (1.29 or earlier) you may need to
        upgrade QueryData.

    4.  WordNet::Similarity: This module is used by some of the
        WordNet::SenseRelate::Algorithm modules while performing the
        disambiguation. You can get this package from
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity/

    5.  XML::Parser: The Senseval2 lexical sample data set is provided in an
        XML format. The XML::Parser package is required to parse these
        files. XML::Parser is available from
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Parser/

    6.  Gtk+ and Gtk::Perl: Graphical interfaces to the modules have been
        included among the tools. These interfaces require that Gtk+ (The
        GIMP Toolkit) and its Perl library Gtk::Perl be installed on the
        system. Gtk+ is available from http://www.gtk.org/ and Gtk::Perl is
        available from http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gtk-Perl/
