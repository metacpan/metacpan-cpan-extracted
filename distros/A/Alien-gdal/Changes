Revision history for Alien::gdal

1.23 2020-09-05
    - Add Alien::Build::Plugin::PkgConfig::PPWrapper
      to more places in Makefile.pl

1.22 2020-09-04
    - Share builds:
      - disable OGDI and mongocxxv3 due to build failures
      - use Alien::Build::Plugin::PkgConfig::PPWrapper

1.21 20200107
    - Share builds:
      - Update makefile for long lines only on GDAL < 3.1.1,
        as 3.1.1 has been patched.
      - Existing install files will be re-used instead of rebuilt
        if they satisfy the minimum version and
        $ENV{ALIEN_SHARE_RECYCLE} is set to a true value.

1.20 20200602
    - Share builds:
      - Modify make steps to exit on first failure.
      - Disable the OpenJPEG driver on CPAN testers.
        Some GDAL configuration or packaging
        issue is causing failures on BSDs.
      - Apply fix for long makefile lines on all platforms.
        This is harmless on those that have no line limits,
        and is version guarded to GDAL<3.2.

1.19 2020-05-31 22:00 AEST
    - Re-enable optional drivers on CPAN testers.
      Interdependencies between drivers mean this
      can cause build failures.

1.18 2020-05-31
    - Add run_utility method
    - Add --with-local arg to dragonfly builds
    - Bump minimum Alien::proj to 1.13.  As a result,
      the minimum Proj version is now 6.1, so the 
      minimum GDAL version is 3.0.

1.17 2019-08-03
    - Make sure we install GDAL 2.4 if Proj version is less than 6.0

1.16 2019-04-04
    - Disable Alien::spatialite for now, as it needs
      to be updated for recent proj changes. It will
      still be linked to if it has been
      pre-installed on a user's system.

1.15 2019-01-25
    - Chain the dynamic libs from all alien deps.
      Hopefully this will avoid some Geo::GDAL::FFI issues.

1.14 2019-01-05
    - Add Alien::spatialite, Alien::proj, Alien::sqlite and Alien::freexl as dependencies.
      This allows GDAL access to spatialite support, and also helps with Proj linkages.
    - Set the Proj library name as an environment variable under Windows.
      Otherwise the DLL provided with Strawberry Perl is not found by GDAL.

1.13 2018-11-27
    - Add Alien::geos::af as a dependency.  This gives us access to the GEOS library.
    
1.11 2018-11-09
    - No further changes from 1.10 dev releases

1.10_004 2018-07-30
    - use Alien::Build::Plugin::Cleanse::BuildDir
    - add Sort::Versions as a configure and build dependency
    - add URI::Escape and URI::File as dependencies

1.10_003 2018-05-14
    - Abbreviate log output under more cpan tester rigs
    - Minor alienfile cleanups

1.10_002 2018-05-14
    - Update the alienfile for GDAL 2.3.0
    - Much of the patching is now version specific to avoid build failures, e.g. on BSD
    - some tests now also set $ENV{DYLIB_DIR}

1.09 2018-07-05
    - No further changes from 1.08 dev releases

1.08_002 2018-05-06
    - Mark the compilation test as to-do until we determine if
      the failures to find libs are due to us or Alien::Test.

1.08_001 2018-05-06
    - Dev release, marking more tests as to-do

1.07 2018-05-05
    - Fallback to PkgConfig to find the share/gdal dir
    - Use Test::Alien in tests
    - Add test for utilities, although it is marked as to-do for
      now due to dynamic lib issues in tests on some platforms

1.05 2018-05-02
    - Add method to access the share/gdal directory.  This contains the data distributed with gdal.
    - Turn cpp11 back on, except for bsd cpan testers.
    - Bump required Alien::Build version to 1.41.
    - Miscellaneous other changes to address cpan testers failures.

1.04 2018-04-25
    - Run make clean on cpantesters to reduce number of build artefacts.
    - See also 1.03_* release notes.  

1.03_010 2018-04-18
    - Add patch file to manifest.  It is needed on freebsd.

1.03_009 2018-04-17
    - Disable static build options to reduce build size (it was too big for many cpan testers).
      Total size should be ~1GB on most systems now.

1.03_008 2018-04-17
    - disable cpp11 on freebsd to avoid CAD build failures

1.03_007 2018-04-16
    - patch configure so we generate a shared build on freebsd

1.03_006 2018-04-16
    - bsd variants use --with-local config arg to ensure /usr/local/include is used

1.03_005 2018-04-14
    - try to add /usr/local/include to include path on bsd variants

1.03_004 2018-04-13
    - use internal tiff library to avoid cpan testers fails

1.03_003 2018-04-11
    - Use plugin for GNU make on bsd variants

1.03_002 2018-04-11
    - Force use of gmake on freebsd

1.03_001 2018-04-10

1.03 2018-04-04
    - Add CI badges

1.02_005 2018-04-02

1.02_003 2018-03-31
    - More cpantesters feedback

1.02_002 2018-03-31
    - More feedback that might help diagnose cpantesters results

1.02_001 2018-03-29
    - See if we can truncate the build log for cpan testers, but display it if we get a failure
    - Reformat the POD a little

1.02 2018-03-28
    - update changes file for 1.01 changes
