Redis-AOF-Tail-File version 0.06
================================

This extension can be used for synchronous data asynchronously from redis to MySQL.
Maybe you can code like below.

  use DBI;
  use Redis::AOF::Tail::File;
  use Storable qw(retrieve store);

  # variables in this comment should be defined
  # $data_source, $username, $auth, \%attr,
  # some_func_translate_redis_command_to_sql()

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $auth, \%attr);
  my $aof_file       = "/var/redis/appendonly.aof";
  my $seek_stor_file = "/var/redis/seek_stor_file";
  my $aof_seek_pos   = 'eof';
  $aof_seek_pos   = ${retrieve $seek_stor_file} if -s $seek_stor_file;

  my $redis_aof = Redis::AOF::Tail::File->new(aof_filename => $aof_file, seekpos => $aof_seek_pos);
  while (my ($pos, $cmd) = $redis_aof->read_command)
  {
    my $sql = some_func_translate_redis_command_to_sql($cmd);
    store \$pos, $seek_stor_file if $dbh->do($sql);
  }
