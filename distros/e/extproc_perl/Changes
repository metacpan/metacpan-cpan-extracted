1.99_01	Sat Nov  8 12:19:19 EST 2003
	* initial alpha release (pre-2.0)
	CHANGES BELOW ARE RELATIVE TO the 1.03 codebase:

	  use of globals and lay the groundwork for future threading support
	* gen_module_libs rewritten in perl for portability & accuracy
	* all oracle functions/procedures now in "Perl" PL/SQL package
	* perl function is now Perl.func
	* perl_p procedure is now Perl.proc
	* former "special subroutines" are their own PL/SQL procedures in the
	  Perl package
	* func & proc now take up to 8 arguments by default
	* debugging and tainting support are always built in
	* new configuration file with various runtime options
	* tainting is now a runtime setting
	* bootstrap file path is a runtime setting
	* can specify additions to @INC as a runtime setting
	* can specify debug directory as a runtime setting
	* simple_query.c and simple_query functions decommissioned
	* oci.c now contains all significant OCI routines
	* ExtProc "convenience" routines removed
	* new fetch_code routine dedicated to fetching code from database
	* code in database now stored as VARCHAR2 instead of CLOB

	* renamed ExtProc::exception to ExtProc::ora_exception
	* ExtProc::is_function & ExtProc::is_procedure will tell you the
	  context of the current call
	* split module shared objects into their own library, libperlxsi,
	  so they can be maintained separately from extproc_perl.so
	* perlxsi.mk Makefile is installed to facilitate linking new modules
	* perl_config view contains configuration settings
