NAME

    PlugAuth::Client::Tiny - Minimal PlugAuth client

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use PlugAuth::Client::Tiny;
     my $client = PlugAuth::Client::Tiny->new( url => "http://localhost:3000/" );
     if($client->auth('primus', 'spark'))
     {
       # authentication succeeded
     }
     else
     {
       # authentication failed
     }

DESCRIPTION

    PlugAuth::Client::Tiny is a minimal PlugAuth client. It uses HTTP::Tiny
    instead of LWP or Mojo::UserAgent. It provides only a mechanism for
    authenticating and authorizing against a PlugAuth server. If you need
    to modify the users/groups/authorization on the server through the
    RESTful API then you will need the heavier PlugAuth::Client which
    relies on Clustericious::Client and Mojo::UserAgent.

    PlugAuth::Client::Tiny should work perfectly with PlugAuth::Lite as
    well, because it only uses the subset of the PlugAuth API which is
    implemented by PlugAuth::Lite.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

     use PlugAuth::Client::Tiny->new;
     my $client = PlugAuth::Client::Tiny->new;

    PlugAuth::Client::Tiny's constructor accepts one optional option:

    url

      The URL of the PlugAuth server. If not specified,
      http://localhost:3000 is used.

    All other options passed to new will be passed on to the constructor of
    HTTP::Tiny, which allows you to set agent, default_headers, etc. See
    the documentation of HTTP::Tiny for details.

ATTRIBUTES

 url

     my $url = $client->url;

    Returns the URL for the PlugAuth server. This attribute is read-only.

METHODS

 auth

     my $bool = $client->auth( $user, $password );

    Attempt to authenticate against the PlugAuth server using the given
    username and password. Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure and dies on a
    connection failure.

 authz

     my $bool = $client->authz( $user, $action, $resource );

    Determine if the given user is authorized to perform the given action
    on the given resource. Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure and dies on
    connection failure.
