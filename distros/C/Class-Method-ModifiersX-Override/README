NAME
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override - adds "override method => sub {...}"
    support to Class::Method::Modifiers

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.14;
       use strict;
       use Test::More;
   
       package Foo {
          sub new { bless []=> shift }
          sub foo { return "foo" }
       }
   
       package Foo::Bar {
          BEGIN { our @ISA = 'Foo' }
          use Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override;
          override foo => sub {
             return uc super;
          };
       }
   
       is( Foo::Bar->new->foo, "FOO" );
       done_testing();

    (Note that the synopsis shows Perl v5.14+ syntax for package declaration,
    but this module and its accompanying Moo and Role::Tiny wrappers support
    Perl v5.8 and above.)

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override extends Class::Method::Modifiers with
    the `override` method modifier, allowing you to use this Moose syntactic
    sugar for overriding superclass methods in non-Moose classes.

    See Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers for details of how `override` and its
    companion function `super` work.

    This module exports two functions:

    `override NAME, CODE`
    `super`

    If you want to use these with Moo classes or role, or with Role::Tiny
    roles, please look at MooX::Override or Role::TinyX::Override instead.

CAVEATS
    This implementation of `override` piggybacks onto
    Class::Method::Modifiers' implementation of `around`. As a result, when
    multiple method modifiers are applied to the same method, the order in
    which they are applied might not match Moose, where `override` modifiers
    are "innermost".

    Given that this implementation of `override` piggybacks onto `around`,
    there's almost no reason to use it; you can just use `around` instead.
    This module mostly exists as an answer to people who complain that Moo
    doesn't support `override`/`super`, but it may also be helpful porting
    Moose code to Moo.

DEPENDENCIES
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override requires Perl 5.008, and the
    Class::Method::Modifiers package (which is available from CPAN).

    The accompanying modules MooX::Override and Role::TinyX::Override require
    Moo and Role::Tiny respectively. However, the installation scripts for
    this distribution do not check that these are installed. If you use
    MooX::Override or Role::TinyX::Override, it is assumed that you have
    installed their dependencies separately.
