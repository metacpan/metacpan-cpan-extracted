To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this
     
            perl -V
     
        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".
     
        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.006 or better.     

     b. The version of Archive-Zip-SimpleZip you have. 
        If you have successfully installed Archive-Zip-SimpleZip, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MArchive::Zip::SimpleZip -e 'print qq[ver $Archive::Zip::SimpleZip::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MArchive::Zip::SimpleZip -e "print qq[ver $Archive::Zip::SimpleZip::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed Archive-Zip-SimpleZip then search Archive::Zip::SimpleZip
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "2.052" ;

 2. If you are having problems building Archive-Zip-SimpleZip, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the Archive-Zip-SimpleZip
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps

        [edit config.in, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
