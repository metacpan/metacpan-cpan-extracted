Summary of important user-visible changes for Bio-DB-NCBIHelper
---------------------------------------------------------------

1.7.5     2019-11-29 16:55:33-06:00 America/Chicago
  * Explicitly add Bio::SeqIO::entrezgene and LWP::Protocol::https as dependencies
  * Actually get '-email' to work which requires overriding get_seq_stream
  * Fix remaining delay settings in tests which are causing issues during peak
    NCBI times

1.7.4     2019-03-10 21:29:52-05:00 America/Chicago
  * Switch away from Bio::Root::Test
  * Add '-email' parameter, which allows lower delay interval at NCBI (currently
    requires setting the '-delay' parameter separately).

1.7.3     2019-03-02 23:05:20-06:00 America/Chicago
  * First release after split from bioperl-live
  * Remove Bio::DB::RefSeq dependency, which isn't tested outside of Bio::DB::RefSeq.
