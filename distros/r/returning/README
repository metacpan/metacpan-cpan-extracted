NAME
    returning - define subs that act like `return`

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::Simple tests => 1;
        
            use returning {
                    Yes   => 1,
                    No    => 0,
            };
        
            sub beats_sissors
            {
                    local $_ = shift;
                    No  if /paper/i;
                    Yes if /rock/i;
                    No  if /scissors/;
            }
        
            ok beats_scissors("rock");

DESCRIPTION
    The `returning` module allows you to define subs which act like `return`.
    That is, they break out of their caller sub. In the SYNPOSIS example, the
    `/scissors/i` regexp is never even evaluated because the `Yes` statement
    breaks out of the the sub, returning "1". The `beats_scissors` function
    could have alternatively been written as:

            sub beats_sissors
            {
                    local $_ = shift;
                    return 0 if /paper/i;
                    return 1 if /rock/i;
                    return 0 if /scissors/;
            }

    `returning` may be especially useful for domain-specific languages.

  Usage
    There are three ways to define a returning sub using this module:

            use returning { subname => 'value' };

    This creates the sub in the caller's namespace called ` subname ` with an
    empty prototype. (So when calling the sub, you don't need to use
    parentheses; just like with constant subs, but without as much
    optimization.)

            use returning { subname => sub { ... } }

    This installs the provided sub into the caller's namespace. This allows
    you to define non-constant subs, including subs that take parameters and
    do interesting stuff with them.

            BEGIN {
                    sub subname { ... }
            };
            use returning 'subname'; # look, no hashref!

    This does not install any sub into the caller's namespace, but modifies an
    existing sub to act in a returning way. Note that because `use` operates
    at compile time, you need to take a lot of care to ensure that the sub has
    already been defined.

    These can be combined, a la...

            use constant ZeroButTrue => '0E0';
            use returning 'ZeroButTrue', {
                    Affirm   => !!1,
                    Deny     => !!0,
                    Mu       => sub { return; },
            }

  Implementation Notes
    My first stab at this used Devel::Declare, but I couldn't quite get it
    working, and nobody in `#devel-declare` seemed sure why it was not. It
    seems possible that the ability to do this lies slightly beyond what
    Devel::Declare is capable of.

    Instead Scope::Upper has been used to create wrappers which jump up one
    more subroutine than expected when they return. This means that some of
    the magic happens at run-time rather than compile-time, so it perhaps
    executes slightly slower, but probably compiled slightly faster.

    An advantage of Scope::Upper is that you can re-export your `returning`
    subs to other packages with no problem, and they'll continue to have their
    special behaviour with no extra effort.

    A feature I had been hoping to achieve with Devel::Declare would be for
    calling a sub with an ampersand (`&Affirm()`) to act as a way of avoiding
    the magic behaviour. This has not been possible with Scope::Upper.

  Class Method
    `returning->setup_for($package, $subname)`
        Given the package name and subname of an *existing* sub, sets up the
        magic.
