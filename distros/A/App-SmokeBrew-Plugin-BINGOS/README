      # smokebrew.cfg
    
      [BINGOS]
      relay = myrelay

DESCRIPTION

    App::SmokeBrew::Plugin::BINGOS is a App::SmokeBrew::Plugin for
    smokebrew which configures the built perl installations for CPAN
    Testing with CPANPLUS::YACSmoke and sending test reports to a
    metabase-relayd host using Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket.

    It will set up the CPANPLUS / CPANPLUS::YACSmoke base locations to be
    in the conf directory under the given prefix directory with a directory
    for each perl version.

CONFIGURATION

    This plugin requires two attributes: relay - the hostname or IP address
    of a metabase-relayd host and port - the TCP port of the
    metabase-relayd on that host.

    These attributes should be specified in the smokebrew.cfg file under a
    named section:

      [BINGOS]
    
      relay = some.host
      port = 8080

METHODS

    configure

      Called by smokebrew to perform the CPAN Testing configuration.
