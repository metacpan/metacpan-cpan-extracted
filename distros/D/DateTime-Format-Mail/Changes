0.403   2016-06-27

- Use DateTime->set_locale instead of ->set to set the locale. Using ->set may
  actually change the local time unintentionally. Patch by Dave Rolsky. GitHub
  PR #2.

0.402   2015-07-06

- included META.JSON (closes RT #105633, by ETHER)

- Fix the tests to accomodate the new 1-digit format for days of month
  before the tenth. Thanks to Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker for the patch.

  and run one test per sample date in t/sample.t

0.400   2014-04-13

- New maintainer - Philippe Bruhat (BooK)

- Now depends on DateTime 0.18. RT #74580.

- Moved POD tests to the release stage.

- format_datetime() now uses 1-digit numbers for day of month < 10.
  Dates with unrecognized timezones lead to the creation of a DateTime
  object with a floating timezone.
  UTC is now formatted as +0000, floating is formatted as -0000.
  RT #94556.

- Now packaged using Dist::Zilla. Moved back to three-digit version numbers.


0.3001  2007-08-30

- No longer including RFCs in the tarball, per the request of the
  Debian maintainer for this package. Apparently, this makes their job
  harder, and it serves no useful purpose for me. Requested by Gunnar
  Wolf. RT #28480.


0.30    2006-07-24

- The strict parsing made the day name mandatory, even though RFC822
  and 2822 specify it as optional. Reported by Julian Mehnle. See RT
  20451.

- Turned off signing, since it seems to be causing more trouble than
  it's worth.
