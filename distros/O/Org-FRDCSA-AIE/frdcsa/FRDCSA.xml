    Automatic Information Extraction
  </acronym-expansion>
  <short-description>
    Attempts to extract regular information from non-binary files
  </short-description>
  <medium-description>
    AIE accepts any non-binary file as input.  It tries to find a
    repeating sequence in the file and then generalizes a regular
    expression to extract the information that varies within the
    repeating structure.
    <!-- Similar to extended description for Debian.
	 
	 QUOTED FROM DEBIAN POLICY

	 3.4.2 The extended description

	 Do not try to continue  the single line synopsis into the extended
	 description.  This   will  not   work  correctly  when   the  full
	 description  is  displayed, and  makes  no  sense  where only  the
	 summary (the single line synopsis) is available.

	 The extended description should describe what the package does and
	 how  it relates  to  the rest  of  the system  (in  terms of,  for
	 example, which subsystem it is which part of).

	 The description field  needs to make sense to  anyone, even people
	 who  have  no idea  about  any of  the  things  the package  deals
	 with.[6]
