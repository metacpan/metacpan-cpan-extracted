   - There were some bugs with as_html when rendering boards smaller than 19x19.

0.9781: Fri Jun 04 2010
   - hrm, there are serious critical flaws in Parse::Lex.  I wish this module
     wasn't married to it.  Parse::Template::ppregexp intentionally changes !
     to \! before it's ineserted in the template.  perl5.8.8 doesn't care at
     all if (?<!blarg) is actually spelled (?<\!blarg) -- although, perhaps it
     should -- but perl5.10 and up *does* care about that.
   - I found a way to do blarg(?<!blarg) without a bang -- kindof.

   - I hope CPAN thinkgs 0.9780>0.9.7.i

0.9.7.i: Thu Jun 03 2010
   - I really haven't worked on this project for a while.  Resurrecting it.
   - There are problem better choices for SGF parsing on CPAN, but I have
     this deployed in a lot of places, so it's worth it to keep it working
     for me.  The largest part of the renewed interest is the fact that
     Parse::Lex installs/tests correctly now.

    To let us parse IGS SGFs out of the box, I made CoPyright[blather blather] equiv to FF[4]... *sigh*

2006-03-09 13:58: 
    I found a bug in the ref copy routine -- that omits comments from nodes returned by as_perl()!

2005-01-19 16:20ish: 
    The Many Faces of Go seems to generate SGFs that SGF2misc can't handle!
    I'm working on it.  MFoG uses [tt] pass format.  Arguably, this is wrong, 
    but according to the specs it's legal in FF[4].   So added.
