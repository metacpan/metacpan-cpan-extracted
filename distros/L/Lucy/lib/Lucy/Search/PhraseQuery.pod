Lucy::Search::PhraseQuery - Query matching an ordered list of terms.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $phrase_query = Lucy::Search::PhraseQuery->new( 
        field => 'content',
        terms => [qw( the who )],
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $phrase_query );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PhraseQuery is a subclass of L<Query|Lucy::Search::Query> for matching
against an ordered sequence of terms.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $phrase_query = Lucy::Search::PhraseQuery->new(
        field => $field,  # required
        terms => $terms,  # required
    );

Create a new PhraseQuery.

=head2 make_compiler

    my $compiler = $phrase_query->make_compiler(
        searcher    => $searcher,     # required
        boost       => $boost,        # required
        subordinate => $subordinate,  # default: false
    );

Abstract factory method returning a Compiler derived from this Query.

=item *

B<searcher> - A Searcher.

=item *

B<boost> - A scoring multiplier.

=item *
