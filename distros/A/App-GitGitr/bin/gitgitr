=head1 NAME

gitgitr - Automatically fetch and build the most recent git.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.907

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    gitgitr
      -- fetches and builds the most recent version of git

    gitgitr -t
      -- fetches and builds the most recent version of git, and runs the
         test suite prior to installation

    gitgitr -v 1.8.0
      -- fetches and builds version 1.8.0 of git

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<gitgitr> is a tiny utility to simplify building the most recent (or,
really, any arbitrary) version of C<git>. This is something you
probably only really need if you're obsessive about running the most
recent version of C<git>, or if you maintain something like
L<Git::Wrapper>, where the ability to quickly install a particular
C<git> version comes up way more often than you would like.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --help / -h

Displays basically the same information you're currently soaking in.

=item --no_symlink / -N

Don't symlink C</opt/git> to the new build directory

=item --prefix / -p

Installation prefix for the current build. Defaults to
C</opt/git-$GIT_VERSION_NUMBER>

=item --reinstall / -r

By default, C<gitgitr> will not build a version that's already
installed. This flag will force it to build a version even if it is
already preset.

=item --run_tests / -t

Makes C<gitgitr> run the C<git> test suite after building and before
installing. If the test suite fails, the build will not be
installed. Disabled by default because the test suite takes a really
long time to run.

=item --verbose / -V

Makes C<gitgitr> be a lot more chatty about what it's doing

=item --version / -v

Specifies what version of C<git> to build. Defaults to the most recent
version as found on the front page of L<http://git-scm.com>
