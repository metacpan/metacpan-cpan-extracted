Revision history for Perl extension BBPerl.

1.10 - Initial write.
1.20 - Fix for adding additional HTML code for the big brother server.
1.30 - Modified the sending routing to fork a new process rather than
       having the module to the work itself. This seemed to be needed
       for many of our Solaris bretheren.
1.40 - Modification to use Sys::Hostname instead of shelling out and 
       running hostname to get the local hosts name. That should make
1.55 - A new function has been added, useFQDN will instruct the 
       monitor to report the Fully Qualified Domain Name.
       AModification to only allow 75 msgs per report. This is a bug
       fix to eliminate issue where test would abort with long cmd line.
       While big brother allows only 50, I still want to make sure that
       the DATA TRUNCATED would appear on the report page.
       Also, date is now computed using POSIX function strftime.
       Lastly, FQDNs are converted to use commas which the BB server likes.
