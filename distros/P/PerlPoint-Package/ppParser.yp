# 0.452   |10.10.2007| JSTENZEL | just for the release;
# 0.451   |06.10.2007| JSTENZEL | just for the release;
# 0.45    |03.12.2006| JSTENZEL | just for the release;
# 0.44    |15.06.2006| JSTENZEL | new type "parsedexample" for \INCLUDE;
#         |06.08.2006| JSTENZEL | bugfix in parameter check of _evalTagCondition(): using
#         |          |          | "if defined $par" instead of "if $par";
#         |27.11.2006| JSTENZEL | better definition of flagSet() etc., old implementation
#         |          |          | was buggy;
# 0.43    |09.04.2006| JSTENZEL | slight code optimizations in file embedding;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | INCLUDE now has an "import" option with module API;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | included file type and embedded language now have
#         |          |          | default "pp";
#         |          | JSTENZEL | run(): new configuration parameter "importMapping";
# 0.42    |05.03.2006| JSTENZEL | non kernel tags now can be configured to be standalone,
#         |          |          | in which case a wrapping paragraph is removed from the
#         |          |          | stream (IMAGE and LOCALTOC configuration moved to tag
#         |          |          | definition);
#         |          |          | area, the wrapping paragraph is removed;
#         |07.03.2006| JSTENZEL | dummy tokens inserted by the parser now are special
#         |          |          | strings that can be filtered out by the backend module;
#         |10.03.2006| JSTENZEL | bugfix: statistics for list shifters did not work;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | Macro default parameters were not documented! Added.
# 0.41    |15.12.2005| JSTENZEL | almost all routines are internal, to avoid Pod::Coverage
#         |          |          | complaints they now begin with an underscore;
# 0.40    |12.06.2003| JSTENZEL | bugfix: delayed tokens were not reparsed when reinserted,
#         |          |          | this could cause trouble when the paragraph (special
#         |          |          | characters) context changed between the point the
#         |          |          | token was detected first and delayed, and the point
#         |          |          | the token is reinserted into the stream (especially
#         |          |          | important after file inclusion, when the stacked token
#         |          |          | is a newline, has to be evaluated in STATE_DEFAULT
#         |          |          | but was stacked in a paragraph where newlines are not
#         |          |          | ignored;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | additionally, "empty paragraphs" (*skipped* paragraphs)
#         |          |          | now are not only *really* empty paragraphs but all
#         |          |          | paragraphs containing of whitespaces only;
#         |21.06.2003| JSTENZEL | headlines provide additional data: their numerical, full
#         |          |          | and shortcut pathes;
#         |22.06.2003| JSTENZEL | _normalizeTableRows() now supplies number of columns both
#         |          |          | in title row and the maximum value;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | new warning if the maximum columns number is detected
#         |          |          | in another line than the first table line (which is the
#         |          |          | base of normalization);
#         |10.08.2003| JSTENZEL | new helper function _semerr() to report semantic errors;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | new option -criticalSemanticErrors;
#         |14.08.2003| JSTENZEL | input filters can access the source file by a variable
#         |          |          | $main::_ifilterFile now;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | fixed an "undefined value" warning;
#         |17.08.2003| JSTENZEL | bugfix: docstream "main" was ignored like any other docstream
#         |          |          | if working in the "docstream ignore" mode;
#         |10.09.2003| JSTENZEL | definition list explanations ("texts" now have an own
#         |          |          | enveloping directive (DIRECTIVE_DPOINT_TEXT);
#         |11.09.2003| JSTENZEL | LOCALTOC added to the list of standalone tags (which are
#         |          |          | stripped of of an enveloping text paragraph if they are its
#         |          |          | only contents);
#         |05.05.2004| JSTENZEL | anchors now take the number of the page they are defined in;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | tag hooks now take an additional parameter: the number of
#         |          |          | the page the tag is used on;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: numerical pathes were built incorrectly: when entering
#         |          |          | a new sublevel, the counter was not reset to 1;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | added anchors();
#         |11.07.2004| JSTENZEL | headlines now provide a path of absolute page numbers as well
#         |          |          | and a variable snapshot;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | a reset variable is removed now (as a side effect, it is no
#         |          |          | longer possible to build variables containing spaces only);
#         |24.07.2004| JSTENZEL | added -skipcomments;
#         |10.09.2004| JSTENZEL | bugfix: words looking like symbolic variables (but not defined
#         |          |          | as such) were restored without their braces ("{}");
#         |27.12.2004| JSTENZEL | bugfix: skipped headline levels were filled with previous
#         |          |          | headline strings of those levels;
#         |28.12.2004| JSTENZEL | text paragraphs now have their own special character, but
#         |          |          | optional: a dot;
#         |24.02.2005| JSTENZEL | acceleration: the lexer built some data very often;
#         |27.02.2005| JSTENZEL | bugfix: backslashes before variables were handled incorrectly,
#         |          |          | now variables are no longer "boosted" but handled like macros
#         |          |          | - which has a performance drawback, unfortunately ...;
#         |16.05.2005| JSTENZEL | backslashes in tag options are no longer ignored but can be
#         |          |          | used to guard characters;
#         |23.08.2005| JSTENZEL | first chapter is checked for a headline now;
# 0.39    |01.02.2003| JSTENZEL | passing directive id chain of the current chapter
#         |          |          | headline to tag hook functions now;
#         |07.03.2003| JSTENZEL | several variable patterns were used explicitly instead
#         |          |          | if the precompiled ones from %lexerPatterns;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: guarded variables were expanded;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | now it is documented that list indentation is reset
#         |          |          | automatically by a subsequent non list paragraph;
#         |26.04.2003| JSTENZEL | added "no utf8" to avoid errors under perl 5.8;
#         |01.05.2003| JSTENZEL | adding *all* composite anchors for headlines, not only
#         |          |          | for the full path;
# 0.38    |07.06.2002| JSTENZEL | restoring doubled backslashes in filtered paragraphs,
#         |          |          | restoring ">" characters as if they were guarded;
#         |04.07.2002| JSTENZEL | simplified several array field access codes;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: empty headlines caused an infinite loop
#         |          |          | when trailing whitespaces should be removed;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: empty headlines caused a failure when headline
#         |          |          | anchors should be stored, skipping them now;
#         |20.08.2002| JSTENZEL | improved tag streaming: stream now contains a body hint;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: paragraph filters restored tag bodies even if
#         |          |          | there was no body;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | old caches need to be updated - adapted compatibility hint;
#         |27.08.2002| JSTENZEL | started to use precompiled lexer patterns;
#         |31.08.2002| JSTENZEL | \INCLUDE, \EMBED and \TABLE now support the _cnd_ option,
#         |          |          | like tags defined externally;
#         |04.12.2002| JSTENZEL | bugfix in pfilter retranslation: backslash reinsertion was
#         |          |          | not performed multiply;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | pfilter retranslation: backslash reinsertion now suppressed
#         |          |          | in verbatim blocks;
#         |01.01.2003| JSTENZEL | added input filter support to \EMBED, via option "ifilter";
#         |02.01.2003| JSTENZEL | added input filter support to \INCLUDE, same interface;
# 0.37    |up to     | JSTENZEL | flagSet() now takes a list of flag names;
#         |14.04.2002| JSTENZEL | names of included files are resolved to avoid trouble
#         |          |          | with links (and to avoid error messages);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | \INCLUDE searches pathes specified in environment
#         |          |          | variable PERLPOINTLIB (like perl, shells, linkers etc.);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | if tags with finish hooks are used, a paragraph will
#         |          |          | not be cached because it becomes potentially dynamic;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | anchors defined by a cached paragraph are cached now
#         |          |          | as well - and restored after a cache hit (updated cache
#         |          |          | format);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | \INCLUDE additionally searches pathes specified in an
#         |          |          | array passed to method run() via new parameter "libpath";
#         |          | JSTENZEL | Filtered paragraphs that need a parser lookahead into
#         |          |          | the next paragraph to be completely detected could cause
#         |          |          | trouble because the reinserted result was grammatically
#         |          |          | placed before the already parsed start token of the
#         |          |          | subsequent paragraph. Fixed by introducing a virtual,
#         |          |          | empty "Word" token supplied by the lexer in such cases
#         |          |          | (look for $flags{virtualParagraphStart} and
#         |          |          | $lexerFlags{cbell}). (By the way, this outdated an
#         |          |          | earlier solution using a virtual text paragraph startup
#         |          |          | and a delayed token - this former solution caused trouble
#         |          |          | when the paragraph following the filtered one was not
#         |          |          | a pure text (so even filtered texts did not work)).
#         |          | JSTENZEL | Filtered paragraphs are no longer cached - the filter
#         |          |          | makes them dynamical. Note that for combined paragraphs
#         |          |          | like compound blocks and lists this is true for the first
#         |          |          | part only, because subsequent parts can be cached in
#         |          |          | their original form (the filter will be applied when the
#         |          |          | parts will have been combined).
#         |          | JSTENZEL | paragraph filters: added retranslation of headlines and
#         |          |          | verbatim blocks;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | passing original paragraph type to filters by new variable
#         |          |          | $main::_pfilterType;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | generalized paragraph type constant to string translation;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | lexer delays to flag the end of the document source
#         |          |          | when a paragraph filter still needs to be applied
#         |          |          | (otherwise, the parser would not request more tokens
#         |          |          | because from his point of view the source was already
#         |          |          | parsed completely, so the filtering result (and the
#         |          |          | original block) would disappear from the result - it would
#         |          |          | not be reparsed);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | empty text paragraphs are no longer made part of the stream;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | blocks were streamed with a final newline, improved;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | added headline shortcuts;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | added document stream entry points;
#         |15.04.2002| JSTENZEL | added chapter docstream hints to headline stream data;
# 0.36    |10.08.2001| JSTENZEL | the stream became a more complex data structure to
#         |          |          | allow converter authors to act according to a documents
#         |          |          | structure (getting headlines without having to process
#         |          |          | all tokens, moving between chapters) - basically, it
#         |          |          | *remained* a stream (with additional structure info);
#         |29.09.2001| JSTENZEL | adapted stream initialization to intermediately
#         |          |          | modified design;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfixes in _normalizeTableRows(): standalone single "0"
#         |          |          | in table cells was removed;
#         |07.10.2001| JSTENZEL | improved error messages provide an error pointer;
#         |11.10.2001| JSTENZEL | removed unused "use fields" directive;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | storing headline anchors now, depending on new
#         |          |          | flag headlineLinks;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | modified tag hook interface, tag body array is now
#         |          |          | passed by *reference*;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | passing anchor object to tag hooks;
#         |12.10.2001| JSTENZEL | added tag finish hook interface;
#         |13.10.2001| JSTENZEL | list shifts are no longer flagged by DIRECTIVE_START
#         |          |          | *and* DIRECTIVE_COMPLETED, no just by DIRECTIVE_START;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | headline start directives in the stream now provide
#         |          |          | the full (plain) headline;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | added tag conditions;
#         |14.10.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: passed tag options to parsing hooks instead
#         |          |          | of tag body;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | using new stream directive index constants;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | stream directives now begin with a hash reference to
#         |          |          | pass backend hints;
#         |17.10.2001| JSTENZEL | new directive format results in modified cache format,
#         |          |          | adapted automatic update;
#         |27.10.2001| JSTENZEL | list directives now contain hints about predecessing
#         |          |          | or following list shifts;
#         |29.10.2001| JSTENZEL | added paragraph filters (in a first version for verb. blocks);
#         |16.11.2001| JSTENZEL | improved _Error();
#         |          | JSTENZEL | improved lexer traces (did hide lines in verb. blocks and
#         |          |          | comments;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | Heredoc close sequence detection is no longer restricted
#         |          |          | to original source lines but also active for lines gotten
#         |          |          | from stack - this became possible because verbatim block
#         |          |          | lines are scanned in *completely* since version 0.34.
#         |          |          | As a result, it is possible now to generate verbatim
#         |          |          | blocks via active contents, but it is still impossible
#         |          |          | to do this for blocks and text paragraphs beginning with
#         |          |          | a tag or macro.
#         |17.11.2001| JSTENZEL | implemented a more general paragraph filter approach
#         |          |          | (still incomplete: needs to be extended for lists, needs
#         |          |          | retranslation of paragraph stream into text);
#         |18.11.2001| JSTENZEL | slightly improved _stackInput() (initially empty lines
#         |          |          | buffers would have been stacked, and a final buffer value
#         |          |          | of "0" would have been ignored);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | detection of block starts and text paragraphs beginning
#         |          |          | with a line now take stacked lines into consideration
#         |          |          | - this was suppressed because stacked input can begin
#         |          |          | anywhere in a real line and not just at the beginning,
#         |          |          | but now it is checked if there was a trailing \n in the
#         |          |          | previous stack entry (we do not have to check previous
#         |          |          | non stacked lines because there is no way to produce
#         |          |          | a beginning paragraph on the stack without a leading
#         |          |          | (and therefore stacked) empty line);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | text passed to paragraph filters is now retranslated from
#         |          |          | the paragraphs streams (implementation still incomplete);
#         |21.11.2001| JSTENZEL | macro definitions can now optionally take option defaults;
#         |22.11.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix in macro definition tag option handling: no boost!;
#         |01.12.2001| JSTENZEL | tables can be filtered now;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | Compound paragraphs can be filtered now!
#         |          | JSTENZEL | lists can be filtered now, added retranslation parts;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | slightly restructered lexer parts: new _lineStartResearch();
#         |02.12.2002| JSTENZEL | slightly restructered lexer parts: new _refLexed()
#         |          |          | (to detect streamed parts placed in the input line, must
#         |          |          | have beed happened before as well??);
# 0.35    |16.06.2001| JSTENZEL | text paragraphs containing an image only are now
#         |          |          | transformed into just the image;
#         |22.07.2001| JSTENZEL | in order to make it run under 5.005 again, a pseudo
#         |          |          | hash was replaced by a pure and simple standard hash;
#         |22.07.2001| JSTENZEL | improved the "specials" pattern in lexer() by guarding "-";
#         |23.07.2001| JSTENZEL | opening input files in binmode() for Windows compatibility;
# 0.34    |14.03.2001| JSTENZEL | added parsing time report;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | slight code optimizations;
#         |20.03.2001| JSTENZEL | introduced tag templates declared via PerlPoint::Tags:
#         |22.03.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: macros could not contain "0":
#         |          | JSTENZEL | comments are now read at once, no longer lexed and parsed,
#         |          |          | likewise, verbatim block lines are handled as one word;
#         |25.03.2001| JSTENZEL | special character activation in tags is now nearer to the
#         |          |          | related grammatical constructs, so "<" is no longer a
#         |          |          | special after the tag body is opened;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | completed tag template interface by checks of mandatory
#         |          |          | parts and hooks into the parser to check options and body;
#         |01.04.2001| JSTENZEL | paragraphs using macros or variables are cached now -
#         |          |          | they can be reused unless macro/variable settings change;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | cache structure now stores parser version for compatibility
#         |          |          | checks;
#         |08.04.2001| JSTENZEL | removed ACCEPT_ALL support;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | improved special character handling in tag recognition
#         |          |          | furtherly: "=" is now very locally specialized;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | tag option and body hooks now take the tag occurence line
#         |          |          | number as their first argument, not the tag name which is
#         |          |          | of course already known to the hook function author;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | The new macro caching feature allowed to improve the cache
#         |          |          | another way: constructions looking like a tag or macro but
#         |          |          | being none of them were streamed and cached like strings
#         |          |          | (because they *were* strings). If later on somebody declared
#         |          |          | such a macro, the cache still found the paragraph unchanged
#         |          |          | (same checksum) and reused the old stream instead of building
#         |          |          | a new stream on base of the resolved macro. Now, if something
#         |          |          | looks like a macro, the macro cache checksum feature is
#         |          |          | activated, so every later macro definition will prevent the
#         |          |          | cached string representation of being reused. Instead of
#         |          |          | this, the new macro will be resolved, and the new resulting
#         |          |          | paragraph stream will be cached. This is by far more
#         |          |          | transparent and intuitive.
#         |11.04.2001| JSTENZEL | added predeclared variables;
#         |19.04.2001| JSTENZEL | embedded Perl code offering no code is ignored now;
#         |21.04.2001| JSTENZEL | replaced call to Parse::Yapps parser object method YYData()
#         |          |          | by direct access to its built in hash entry USER as suggested
#         |          |          | by the Parse::Yapp manual for reasons of efficiency;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: all parts restored from @inputStack were handled as
#         |          |          | new lines which caused several unnecessay operations including
#         |          |          | line number updates, cache paragraph checksumming and
#         |          |          | removal of "leading" whitespaces (tokens recognized as Ils
#         |          |          | while we were still in a formerly started line) - this fix
#         |          |          | should accelerate processing of documents using numerous
#         |          |          | macros (when cached) and of course avoid invalid token removals;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | tables are now "normalized": if a table row contains less
#         |          |          | columns than the headline row, the missed columns are
#         |          |          | automatically added (this helps converters to detect empty columns);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: internal table flags were not all reset if a table
#         |          |          | was completed, thus causing streams for subsequent tables
#         |          |          | being built with additional, incorrect elements;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | adapted macro handling to the new tag handling: if now options or
#         |          |          | or body was declared in the macro definition, options or body are
#         |          |          | not evaluated
#         |22.04.2001| JSTENZEL | the first bugfix yesterday was too common, improved;
#         |24.04.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: conditions were handled in headline state, causing
#         |          |          | backslashes to be removed; new state STATE_CONDITION added;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | added first function (flagSet()) of a simplified condition
#         |          |          | interface (SCI) which is intended to allow non (Perl) programmers
#         |          |          | to easily understand and perform common checks;
#         |27.04.2001| JSTENZEL | $^W is a global variable - no need to switch to the Safe
#         |          |          | compartment to modify it;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | added next function (varValue()) of a the SCI;
#         |29.04.2001| JSTENZEL | now the parser predeclares variables as well: first one is
#         |          |          | $_STARTDIR to flag where processing started;
#         |21.05.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix in table handling: one column tables were not handled
#         |          |          | correctly, modified table handling partly by the way si that
#         |          |          | in the future it might become possible to have nested tables;
#         |22.05.2001| JSTENZEL | source nesting level is now reported by an internal variable _SOURCE_LEVEL;
#         |23.05.2001| JSTENZEL | table fields are trimmed now: beginning and trailing whitespaces are removed;
#         |24.05.2001| JSTENZEL | text paragraphs containing only a table become just a table now;
#         |24.05.2001| JSTENZEL | text paragraphs now longer contain a final whitespace (made from the
#         |          |          | final carriage return;
#         |25.05.2001| JSTENZEL | completed support for the new \TABLE flag option "rowseparator" which
#         |          |          | allows you to separate table columns by a string of your choice enabling
#         |          |          | streamed tables like in
#         |          |          | "Look: \TABLE{rowseparator="+++"} c1 | c2 +++ row 2, 1 | row 2, 2 \END_TABLE";
#         |          | JSTENZEL | slightly reorganized the way tag build table streams are completed,
#         |          |          | enabling a more common detection of prebuild stream parts - in fact, if
#         |          |          | this description makes no sense to you, this enables to place \END_TABLE
#         |          |          | even *in* the final table line instead of in a new line (as usually done
#         |          |          | and documented);
#         |26.05.2001| JSTENZEL | added new parser option "nestedTables" which enables table nesting if set
#         |          |          | to a true value. made nesting finally possible;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | to help converters handling nested tables, tables now provide their
#         |          |          | nesting level by the new internal table option "__nestingLevel__";
#         |27.05.2001| JSTENZEL | cache hits are no longer mentioned in the list of expected tokens displayed
#         |          |          | by _Error(), because the message is intended to be read by humans who
#         |          |          | cannot insert cache hits into a document;
#         |28.05.2001| JSTENZEL | new predeclared variable _PARSER_VERSION;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | new \INCLUDE option "localize";
#         |31.05.2001| JSTENZEL | new headline level offset keyword "base_level";
#         |01.06.2001| JSTENZEL | performance boost by lexing words no longer as real words or even
#         |          |          | characters but as the longest strings until the next special character;
#         |02.06.2001| JSTENZEL | improved table field trimming in _normalizeTableRows();
#         |05.06.2001| JSTENZEL | the last line in a source file is now lexed the optimized way as well;
#         |06.06.2001| JSTENZEL | cache structure now stores constant declarations version for compatability
#         |          |          | checks;
#         |09.06.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: headlines could not begin with a character that can start a
#         |          |          | paragraph - fixed by introducing new state STATE_HEADLINE_LEVEL;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | variable names can contain umlauts now;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | updated inlined module documentation (POD);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | used Storable version is now stored in cache, cache is rebuilt
#         |          |          | automatically if a different Storable version is detected;
#         |10.06.2001| JSTENZEL | added code execution by eval() (on users request);
#         |12.06.2001| JSTENZEL | code executed by eval() or do() is no started with "no strict" settings
#         |          |          | to enable unlimited access to functions, like under Safe control
#         |          |          | (also this is by no means optimal so it might be improved later);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | tag hooks can reply various values now;
#         |15.06.2001| JSTENZEL | tags take exactly *one* hook into consideration now: this simplifies
#         |          |          | and accelerates the interface *and* allows hooks for tags neither
#         |          |          | owning option nor nody;
# 0.33    |22.02.2001| JSTENZEL | slightly improved PerlPoint::Parser::DelayedToken;
#         |25.02.2001| JSTENZEL | variable values can now begin with every character;
#         |13.03.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix in handling cache hits for continued ordered lists:
#         |          |          | list numbering is updated now;
#         |14.03.2001| JSTENZEL | added mailing list hint to POD;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | undefined return values of embedded Perl are no longer
#         |          |          | tried to be parsed, this is for example useful to
#         |          |          | predeclare functions;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | slight bugfix in internal ordered list counting which
#         |          |          | takes effect if an ordered list is *started* by "##";
# 0.32    |07.02.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: bodyless macros can now be used without moving
#         |          |          | subsequent tokens before the macro replacement;
#         |10.02.2001| JSTENZEL | added new special type "example" to \INCLUDE to relieve
#         |          |          | people who want to include files just as examples;
# 0.31    |30.01.2001| JSTENZEL | ordered lists now provide the entry level number
#         |          |          | (additionally to the first list point which already
#         |          |          | did this if the list was continued);
#         |01.02.2001| JSTENZEL | made POD more readable to pod2man;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | bugfix: if a headline is restored from cache, internal
#         |          |          | headline level flags need to be restored as well to
#         |          |          | make \INCLUDE{headlinebase=CURRENT_LEVEL} work when
#         |          |          | it is the first thing in a document except of headlines
#         |          |          | which are all restored from cache;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | new "smart" option of \INCLUDE tag suppresses inclusion
#         |          |          | if the file was already loaded, which is useful for alias
#         |          |          | definitions used both in a nested and the base source;
#         |02.02.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: circular source nesting was supressed too hard:
#         |          |          | a source could never be loaded twice, but this may be
#         |          |          | really useful to reuse files multiply - now only the
#         |          |          | currently nested sources are taken into account;
#         |03.02.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: continued lists did not work as expected yet,
#         |          |          | now they do (bug was detected by Lorenz), improved by
#         |          |          | the way: continued list points not really continuing
#         |          |          | are streamed now as usual list points (no level hint);
# 0.30    |05.01.2001| JSTENZEL | slight lexer improvement (removed obsolete code);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | modified the grammar a way that shift/reduce conflicts
#         |          |          | were reduced (slightly) and, more important, the grammar
#         |          |          | now passes yacc/bison (just a preparation);
#         |20.01.2001| JSTENZEL | variable settings are now propagated into the stream;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | improved syntactical error messages;
#         |23.01.2001| JSTENZEL | bugfix: embedding into tags failed because not all
#         |          |          | special settings were restored correctly, especially
#         |          |          | for ">" which completes a tag body;
#         |27.01.2001| JSTENZEL | fixed "unintialized value" warning (cache statistics);
#         |          | JSTENZEL | tag implementation is now more restrictive: according
#         |          |          | to the language definition tag and macro names now *have*
#         |          |          | to be built from capitals and underscores, thus reducing
#         |          |          | potential tag recognition confusion with ACCEPT_ALL;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | lowercased alias names in alias definitions are now
#         |          |          | automatically converted into capitals because of the
#         |          |          | modfied tag/macro recognition just mentioned before;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | POD: added a warning to the POD section that the cache
#         |          |          | should be cleansed after introducing new macros which
#         |          |          | could possibly be used as simple text before;
# 0.29    |21.12.2000| JSTENZEL | direct setting of $VERSION variable to enable CPAN to
#         |          |          | detect and display the parser module version;
#         |          | JSTENZEL | introduced base settings for active contents provided
#         |          |          | in %$PerlPoint - a new common way to pass things like
#         |          |          | the current target language;
#         |27.12.2000| JSTENZEL | closing angle brackets are to be guarded only *once*
#         |          |          | now - in former versions each macro level added the need
#         |          |          | of yet another backslash;
#         |28.12.2000| JSTENZEL | macro bodies are no longer reparsed which accelerates
#         |          |          | procesing of nested macros drastically (and avoids the

#         |          |          | parsing it again - this way, parsing becomes easier to
#         |          |          | maintain in case of syntax extensions (nevertheless, the

=head1 NAME

B<PerlPoint::Parser> - a PerlPoint Parser

=head1 VERSION

This manual describes version B<0.451>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # load the module:
  use PerlPoint::Parser;

  # build the parser and run it
  # to get intermediate data in @stream
  my ($parser)=new PerlPoint::Parser;
  $parser->run(
               stream => \@stream,
               files  => \@files,
              );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The PerlPoint format, initially designed by Tom Christiansen, is intended
to provide a simple and portable way to generate slides without the need of
a proprietary product. Slides can be prepared in a text editor of your choice,
generated on any platform where you find perl, and presented by any browser
which can render the chosen output format.

To sum it up,
I<PerlPoint Software takes an ASCII text and transforms it into slides written in a certain document description language.>
This is, by tradition, usually HTML, but you may decide to use another format like
XML, SGML, TeX or whatever you want.

Well, this sounds fine, but how to build a translator which transforms ASCII
into the output format of your choice? Thats what B<PerlPoint::Parser> is made for.
It performs the first translation step by parsing ASCII and transforming it
into an intermediate stream format, which can be processed by a subsequently
called translator backend. By separating parsing and output generation we
get the flexibility to write as many backends as necessary by using the same
parser frontend for all translators.

B<PerlPoint::Parser> supports the complete I<GRAMMAR> with exception of I<certain>
tags. Tags I<are> supported the I<most common way>: the parser recognizes I<any>
tag which is declared by the author of a translator. This way the
parser can be used for various flavours of the PerlPoint language without
having to be modified. So, if there is a need of a certain new flag, it can
quickly be added without any change to B<PerlPoint::Parser>.

The following chapters describe the input format (I<GRAMMAR>) and the
generated stream format (I<STREAM FORMAT>). Finally, the class methods are
described to show you how to build a parser.


=head1 GRAMMAR

This chapter describes how a PerlPoint ASCII slide description has to be
formatted to pass B<PerlPoint::Parser> parsers.

I<Please note> that the input format does I<not> completely determine how
the output will be designed. The final I<format> depends on the backend
which has to be called after the parser to transform its output into a
certain document description language. The final I<appearance> depends on
the I<browsers> behaviour.

Each PerlPoint document is made of I<paragraphs>.

=head2 The paragraphs

All paragraphs start at the beginning of their first line. The first character
or string in this line determines which paragraph is recognized.

A paragraph is completed by an empty line (which may contain whitespaces).
Exceptions are described.

Carriage returns in paragraphs which are completed by an empty line
are transformed into a whitespace.

=over 4

=item Comments

start with "//" and reach until the end of the line.


=item Headlines

start with one or more  "=" characters.
The number of "=" characters represents the headline level.

  =First level headline

  ==Second level headline

  ===Multi
    line
   headline
  example

It is possible to declare a "short version" of the headline
title by appending a "~" and plain strings to the headline
like in

   =Very long headlines are expressive but may exceed the
    available space for example in HTML navigation bars or
    something like that ~ Long headlines

The "~" often stands for similarity, or represents the described
object in encyclopedias or dictionaries. So one may think of this
as "long title is (sometimes) similar to short title".



=item Lists

B<Points> or B<unordered lists> start with a "*" character.

  * This is a first point.

  * And, I forgot,
    there is something more to point out.

There are B<ordered lists> as well, and I<they> start with a hash sign ("#"):

  # First, check the number of this.

  # Second, don't forget the first.

The hash signs are intended to be replaced by numbers by a backend.

Because PerlPoint works on base of paragraphs, any paragraph different to
an ordered list point I<closes an ordered list>. If you wish the list to
be continued use a double hash sign in case of the single one in the point
that reopens the list.

  # Here the ordered list begins.

  ? $includeMore

  ## This is point 2 of the list that started before.

  # In subsequent points, the usual single hash sign
    works as expected again.

List continuation works list level specific (see below for level details).
A list cannot be continued in another chapter. Using "##" in the first
point of a new list takes no special effect: the list will begin as usual
(with number 1).

B<Definition lists> are a third list variant. Each item starts with the
described phrase enclosed by a pair of colons, followed by the definition
text:

  :first things: are usually described first,

  :others:       later then.

All lists can be I<nested>. A new level is introduced by
a special paragraph called I<"list indention"> which starts with a ">". A list level
can be terminated by a I<"list indention stop"> paragraph starting with a "<"
character. (These startup characters symbolize "level shifts".)

  * First level.

  * Still there.

>

  * A list point of the 2nd level.

<

  * Back on first level.

It is possible to shift more than one level by adding a number. There should be no whitespace between the
level shift character and the level number.

  * First level.

>

  * Second level.

>

  * Third level.

<2

  * Back on first level.

Level shifts are accepted between list items I<only>.

I<Please note that there is no need to shift levels back if a list is completed.> Any non list
paragraph will I<reset> list indentation, as well as the end of the source.


=item Texts

are paragraphs like points but begin I<immediately> without a startup
character:

  This is a simple text.

  In this new text paragraph,
  we demonstrate the multiline feature.

I<Optionally>, a text paragraph can be started with a special character
as well, which is a dot:

  .This is a simple text with dot.

  .In this new text paragraph,
  we demonstrate the multiline feature.

This is intended to be used by generators which translate other formats
into PerlPoint, to make sure the first character of a paragraph has no
special meaning to the PerlPoint parser.


=item Blocks

are intended to contain examples or code I<with> tag recognition.
This means that the parser will discover embedded tags. On the other hand,
it means that one may have to escape ">" characters embedded into tags. Blocks
begin with an I<indentation> and are completed by the next empty line.

  * Look at these examples:

      A block.

      \I<Another> block.
      Escape ">" in tags: \C<<\>>.

  Examples completed.

Subsequent blocks are joined together automatically: the intermediate empty
lines which would usually complete a block are translated into real empty
lines I<within> the block. This makes it easier to integrate real code
sequences as one block, regardless of the empty lines included. However,
one may explicitly I<wish> to separate subsequent blocks and can do so
by delimiting them by a special control paragraph:

  * Separated subsequent blocks:

      The first block.

  -

      The second block.

Note that the control paragraph starts at the left margin.


=item Verbatim blocks

are similar to blocks in indentation but I<deactivate>
pattern recognition. That means the embedded text is I<not> scanned for tags
and empty lines and may therefore remain as it was in its original place,
possibly a script.

These special blocks need a special syntax. They are implemented as here documents.
Start with a here document clause flagging which string will close the "here document":

  <<EOC

    PerlPoint knows various
    tags like \B, \C and \I. # unrecognized tags

  EOC


=item Tables

are supported as well, they start with an @ sign which is
followed by the column delimiter:

  @|
   column 1   |   column 2   |  column 3
    aaa       |    bbb       |   ccc
    uuu       |    vvvv      |   www

The first line is automatically marked as a  "table headline". Most converters
emphasize such headlines by bold formatting, so there is no need to insert \B
tags into the document.

If a table row contains less columns than the table headline, the "missed"
columns are automatically added. This is,

  @|
  A | B | C
  1
  1 |
  1 | 2
  1 | 2 |
  1 | 2 | 3

is streamed exactly like

  @|
  A | B | C
  1 |   |
  1 |   |
  1 | 2 |
  1 | 2 |
  1 | 2 | 3

to make backend handling easier. (Empty HTML table cells, for example, are rendered
slightly obscure by certain browsers unless they are filled with invisible characters,
so a converter to HTML can detect such cells because of normalization and handle them
appropriately.)

Please note that normalization refers to the headline row. If another line contains
I<more> columns than the headline, normalization does not care. If the maximum column
number is detected in another row, a warning is issued. (As a help for converter authors,
the title and maximum column number are made part of a table tag as internal options
C<__titleColumns__> and C<__maxColumns__>.)

In all tables, leading and trailing whitespaces of a cell are
automatically removed, so you can use as many of them as you want to
improve the readability of your source. The following table is absolutely
equivalent to the last example:

  @|
  A                |       B         |      C
  1                |                 |
   1               |                 |
    1              | 2               |
     1             |  2              |
      1            | 2               |      3

There is also a more sophisticated way to describe tables, see the tag section below.

Note: Although table paragraphs cannot be nested, tables declared by tag possibly
I<can> (and might be embedded into table paragraphs as well). To help converter authors
handling nested tables, the opening table tag provides an internal option "__nestingLevel__".


=item Conditions

start with a  "?" character. If active contents is enabled, the paragraph text
is evaluated as Perl code. The (boolean) evaluation result then determines if
subsequent PerlPoint is read and parsed. If the result is false, all subsequent
paragraphs until the next condition are I<skipped>.

Note that base data is made available by a global (package) hash reference
B<$PerlPoint>. See I<run()> for details about how to set up these data.

Conditions can be used to maintain various language versions of a presentation
in one source file:

  ? $PerlPoint->{targetLanguage} eq 'German'

Or you could enable parts of your document by date:

  ? time>$dateOfTalk

or by a special setting:

  ? flagSet('setting')

Please note that the condition code shares its variables with embedded and included
code.

To make usage easier and to improve readability, condition code is evaluated with
disabled warnings (the language variable in the example above may not even been set).

Converter authors might want to provide predefined variables such as "$language"
in the example.

Note: If a document uses I<document streams>, be careful in intermixing docstream
entry points and conditions. A condition placed in a skipped document stream will
not e evaluated. A document stream entry point placed in a source area hidden by
a false condition will not be reconized.


=item Variable assignment paragraphs

Variables can be used in the text and will be automatically replaced by their string
values (if declared).

  The next paragraph sets a variable.

  $var=var

  This variable is called $var.

All variables are made available to embedded and included Perl code as well as to
conditions and can be accessed there as package variables of "main::" (or whatever
package name the Safe object is set up to). Because a
variable is already replaced by the parser if possible, you have to use the fully
qualified name or to guard the variables "$" prefix character to do so:

  \EMBED{lang=perl}join(' ', $main::var, \$var)\END_EMBED

Variable modifications by embedded or included Perl I<do not> affect the variables
visible to the parser. (This is true for conditions as well.) This means that

  $var=10
  \EMBED{lang=perl}$main::var*=2;\END_EMBED

causes I<$var> to be different on parser and code side - the parser will still use a
value of 10, while embedded code works on with a value of 20.

=item Macro or alias definitions

Sometimes certain text parts are used more than once. It would be a relieve
to have a shortcut instead of having to insert them again and again. The same
is true for tag combinations a user may prefer to use. That's what I<aliases>
(or "macros") are designed for. They allow a presentation author to declare
his own shortcuts and to use them like a tag. The parser will resolve such aliases,
replace them by the defined replacement text and work on with this replacement.

An alias declaration starts with a "+" character followed I<immediately> by the
alias I<name> (without backslash prefix), optionally followed I<immediately>
by an option default list in "{}", followed I<immediately> by a colon.
(No additional spaces here.)

I<All text after this colon up to the paragraph closing empty line is stored as the replacement text.>
So, whereever you will use the new macro, the parser will replace it by this
text and I<reparse> the result. This means that your macro text can contain
any valid constructions like tags or other macros.

The replacement text may contain strings embedded into doubled underscores like
C<__this__>. This is a special syntax to mark that the macro takes parameters
of these names (e.g. C<this>). If a macro is used and these parameters are set,
their values will replace the mentioned placeholders. The special placeholder
"__body__" is used to mark where the macro I<body> is to place.

If a macro is used and defined options are I<unset>, but there are defaults
for them in the optional default list, these defaults will be used for the
respective options.

Here are a few examples:

  +RED:\FONT{color=red}<__body__>

  +F:\FONT{color=__c__}<__body__>

  +COLORED{c=blue}:\FONT{color=__c__}<__body__>

  +IB:\B<\I<__body__>>

  This \IB<text> is \RED<colored>.

  Defaults: first, text in \COLORED{c=red}<Red>,
  now text in \COLORED<Blue>.

  +TEXT:Macros can be used to abbreviate longer
     texts as well as other tags
  or tag combinations.

  +HTML:\EMBED{lang=html}

  Tags can be \RED<\I<nested>> into macros.
  And \I<\F{c=blue}<vice versa>>.
  \IB<\RED<This>> is formatted by nested macros.
  \HTML This is <i>embedded HTML</i>\END_EMBED.

  Please note: \TEXT

I<If no parameter is defined in the macro definition, options will not be recognized.>
The same is true for the body part.
I<Unless C<__body__> is used in the macro definition, macro bodies will not be recognized.>
This means that with the definition

  +OPTIONLESS:\B<__body__>

the construction

  \OPTIONLESS{something=this}<more>

is evaluated as a usage of C<\OPTIONLESS> without body, followed by the I<string>
C<{something=here}>. Likewise, the definition

  +BODYLESS:found __something__

causes

  \BODYLESS{something=this}<more>

to be recognized as a usage of C<\BODYLESS> with option C<something>, followed
by the I<string> C<<more>>. So this will be resolved as C<found this>. Finally,

  +JUSTTHENAME:Text phrase.

enforces these constructions

  ... \JUSTTHENAME, ...
  ... \JUSTTHENAME{name=Name}, ...
  ... \JUSTTHENAME<text>, ...
  ... \JUSTTHENAME{name=Name}<text> ...

to be translated into

  ... Text phrase. ...
  ... Text phrase.{name=Name} ...
  ... Text phrase.<text>, ...
  ... Text phrase.{name=Name}<text> ...

The principle behind all this is to make macro usage I<easier> and intuative:
why think of options or a body or of special characters possibly treated as
option/body part openers unless the macro makes use of an option or body?

An I<empty> macro text I<undefines> the macro (if it was already known).

  // undeclare the IB alias
  +IB:

An alias can be used like a tag.

Aliases named like a tag I<overwrite> the tag (as long as they are defined).


=item Document stream entry points

A document stream is a "document in document" and best explained by example.

  Consider a document talking about
  two scripts and comparing them. A
  typical review of this type is
  structured this way: headline, notes
  about script 1, notes about script 2,
  new headline to discuss another aspect,
  notes about script 1, notes about
  script 2, and so on.

Everything said about item 1 is a document stream, everything about object 2
as well. and a third stream is implicitly built by all parts outside these
two. In slide construction, each stream can have its own area, for example

  -------------------------------------
  |                                   |
  |            main stream            |
  |                                   |
  -------------------------------------
  |                 |                 |
  |  item 1 stream  |  item 2 stream  |
  |                 |                 |
  -------------------------------------

But to construct a layout like this, streams need to be distinguished, and
that is what "stream entry points" are made for.

A stream entry point starts with a "~" character, followed by a string
which is the name of the stream. This may be an internal name only, or
converters may turn it into a document part as well. The C<__ALL__> string
is reserved for internal purposes. It is recommended to treat C<__MAIN__>
as reserved as well, although it has no special meaning yet.

Once an entry point was passed, all subsequent document parts belong to the
declared stream, up to the next entry point or a headline which implicitly
switches back to the "main stream".

The parser can be instructed to ignore certain streams, see I<run()> for
details. If this feature is used, please be careful in intermixing stream
entry points and conditions. A condition placed in a skipped document
stream will not be evaluated.

I<It is up to a converter how document streams are used.> Certain converters
may ignore them at all. As a convenient solution, the parser can be instructed
to transform stream entry points into headlines (one level below the current
real headline level). See I<run()> for details.



=back

=head2 Tags

Tags are directives embedded into the text stream, commanding how certain parts
of the text should be interpreted. Tags are declared by using one or more modules
build on base of B<PerlPoint::Tags>.

  use PerlPoint::Tags::Basic;

B<PerlPoint::Parser> parsers can recognize all tags which are build of a backslash
and a number of capitals and numbers.

  \TAG

I<Tag options> are optional and follow the tag name immediately, enclosed
by a pair of corresponding curly braces. Each option is a simple string
assignment. The value has to be quoted if /^\w+$/ does not match it.

  \TAG{par1=value1 par2="www.perl.com" par3="words and blanks"}

The I<tag body> is anything you want to make the tag valid for. It is optional
as well and immediately follows the optional parameters, enclosed by "<" and ">":

  \TAG<body>
  \TAG{par=value}<body>

Tags can be I<nested>.

To provide a maximum of flexibility, tags are declared I<outside> the parser.
This way a translator programmer is free to implement the tags he needs. It is
recommended to always support the basic tags declared by B<PerlPoint::Tags::Basic>.
On the other hand,a few tags of special meaning are reserved and cannot be declared
by converter authors, because they are handled by the parser itself. These are:

=over 4

=item \INCLUDE

It is possible to include a file into the input stream. Have a look:

 \INCLUDE{type=HTML file=filename}

This imports the file "filename". The file contents is made part of the
generated stream, but not parsed. This is useful to include target language
specific, preformatted parts.

If, however, the file type is specified as "PP", the file contents is
made part of the input stream and parsed. In this case a special tag option
"headlinebase" can be specified to define a headline base level used as
an offset to all headlines in the included document. This makes it easier
to share partial documents with others, or to build complex documents by
including separately maintained parts, or to include one and the same
part at different headline levels.

 Example: If "\INCLUDE{type=PP file=file headlinebase=20}" is
          specified and "file" contains a one level headline
          like "=Main topic of special explanations"
          this headline is detected with a level of 21.

Pass the special keyword "CURRENT_LEVEL" to this tag option if you want to
set just the I<current> headline level as an offset. This results in
"subchapters".

 Example:

 ===Headline 3

 // let included chapters start on level 4
 \INCLUDE{type=PP file=file headlinebase=CURRENT_LEVEL}

Similar to "CURRENT_LEVEL", "BASE_LEVEL" sets the current I<base>
headline level as an offset. The "base level" is the level above
the current one. Using "BASE_LEVEL" results in parallel chapters.

 Example:

 ===Headline 3

 // let included chapters start on level 3
 \INCLUDE{type=PP file=file headlinebase=BASE_LEVEL}

A given offset is reset when the included document is parsed completely.

A second special option I<smart> commands the parser to include the file
only unless this was already done before. This is intended for inclusion
of pure alias/macro definition or variable assignment files.

 \INCLUDE{type=PP file="common-macros.pp" smart=1}

Included sources may declare variables of their own, possibly overwriting
already assigned values. Option "localize" works like Perls C<local()>:
such changes will be reversed after the nested source will have been
processed completely, so the original values will be restored. You can
specify a comma separated list of variable names or the special string
C<__ALL__> which flags that I<all> current settings shall be restored.

 \INCLUDE{type=PP file="nested.pp" localize=myVar}

 \INCLUDE{type=PP file="nested.pp" localize="var1, var2, var3"}

 \INCLUDE{type=PP file="nested.pp" localize=__ALL__}


PerlPoint authors can declare an I<input filter> to preprocess the
included file. This is done via option I<ifilter>:

  \INCLUDE{type=pp file="source.pod" ifilter="pod2pp()"}

An input filter is a snippet of user defined Perl code, taking the
included file via C<@main::_ifilterText> and the target type via
C<$main::_ifilterType>. The original filename can be accessed via
C<$main::_ifilterType>. It should supply its result as an array
of strings which will then be processed instead of the original file.

Input filters are Active Content. If Active Content is disabled,
\INCLUDE tags using input filters will be ignored I<completely>.


As a simplified option, C<import> allows to use I<predefined>
import filters defined in C<PerlPoint::Import::...> modules. To use
such a filter do I<not> set the C<ifilter> option, set C<import> instead.
C<import> takes the name of the source format, like "POD", or a true
number to indicate that the file extension should be used as the source
format name. The uppercased name is used as the final part of the filter
module - for "POD", the modules name would be "PerlPoint::Import::POD".
If this module is installed and has a function C<importFilter()> this
function name is used like C<ifilter>.

Here are a few examples:

  \INCLUDE{file="source.pod" import=1}

  \INCLUDE{file="source.pod" import=pod}

  \INCLUDE{file=source import=pod}

Please note that in the last example C<import=1> will not work, as the
source file has no extension that indicates its format is POD.

If C<ifilter> is used together with C<import>, C<import> is ignored.


A PerlPoint file can be included wherever a tag is allowed, but sometimes
it has to be arranged slightly: if you place the inclusion directive at
the beginning of a new paragraph I<and> your included PerlPoint starts by
a paragraph of another type than text, you should begin the included file
by an empty line to let the parser detect the correct paragraph type. Here
is an example: if the inclusion directive is placed like

  // include PerlPoint
  \INCLUDE{type=pp file="file.pp"}

and file.pp immediately starts with a verbatim block like

  <<VERBATIM
      verbatim
  VERBATIM

, I<the inclusion directive already opens a new paragraph> which is detected to
be "text" (because there is no special startup character). Now in the included
file, from the parsers point of view the included PerlPoint is simply a
continuation of this text, because a paragraph ends with an empty line. This
trouble can be avoided by beginning the included file by an empty line,
so that its first paragraph can be detected correctly.

The second special case is a file type of "Perl". If active contents is enabled,
included Perl code is read into memory and evaluated like I<embedded> Perl. The
results are made part of the input stream to be parsed.

  // execute a perl script and include the results
  \INCLUDE{type=perl file="disk-usage.pl"}

As another option, files may be declared to be of type "example" or "parsedexample".
This makes the file placed into the source as a verbatim block (with "example"), or
a standard block (with "parsedexample"), respectively, without need to copy its contents
into the source.

  // include an external script as an example
  \INCLUDE{type=example file="script.csh"}

All lines of the example file are included as they are but can be indented on request.
To do so, just set the special option "indent" to a positive numerical value equal to
the number of spaces to be inserted before each line.

  // external example source, indented by 3 spaces
  \INCLUDE{type=example file="script.csh" indent=3}

Including external scripts this way can accelerate PerlPoint authoring significantly,
especially if the included files are still subject to changes.

It is possible to filter the file types you wish to include (with exception
of "pp" and "example"), see below for details. I<In any case>, the mentioned file
has to exist.



=item \EMBED and \END_EMBED

Target format code does not necessarily need to be imported - it can be
directly I<embedded> as well. This means that one can write target language
code within the input stream using I<\EMBED>:

  \EMBED{lang=HTML}
  This is <i><b>embedded</b> HTML</i>.
  The parser detects <i>no</i> PerlPoint
  tag here, except of <b>END_EMBED</b>.
  \END_EMBED

Because this is handled by I<tags>, not by paragraphs, it can be placed
directly in a text like this:

  These \EMBED{lang=HTML}<i>italics</i>\END_EMBED
  are formatted by HTML code.

Please note that the EMBED tag does not accept a tag body (to avoid
ambiguities).

Both tag and embedded text are made part of the intermediate stream.
It is the backends task to deal with it. The only exception of this rule
is the embedding of I<Perl> code, which is evaluated by the parser.
The reply of this code is made part of the input stream and parsed as
usual.

PerlPoint authors can declare an I<input filter> to preprocess the
embedded text. This is done via option I<ifilter>:

  \EMBED{lang=pp ifilter="pod2pp()"}

  =head1 POD formatted part

  This part was written in POD.

  \END_EMBED

An input filter is a snippet of user defined Perl code, taking the
embedded text via C<@main::_ifilterText> and the target language via
C<$main::_ifilterType>. The original filename can be accessed via
C<$main::_ifilterType> (but please note that this is the source with
the \EMBED tag). It should supply its result as an array of
strings which will then be processed as usual.

Input filters are Active Contents. If Active Contents is disabled,
embedded parts using input filters will be ignored I<completely>.

It is possible to filter the languages you wish to embed (with exception
of "PP"), see below for details.


=item \TABLE and \END_TABLE

It was mentioned above that tables can be built by table paragraphs.
Well, there is a tag variant of this:

  \TABLE{bg=blue separator="|" border=2}
  \B<column 1>  |  \B<column 2>  | \B<column 3>
     aaaa       |     bbbb       |  cccc
     uuuu       |     vvvv       |  wwww
  \END_TABLE

This is sligthly more powerfull than the paragraph syntax: you can set
up several table features like the border width yourself, and you can
format the headlines as you like.

As in all tables, leading and trailing whitespaces of a cell are
automatically removed, so you can use as many of them as you want to
improve the readability of your source.

The default row separator (as in the example above) is a carriage return,
so that each table line can be written as a separate source line. However,
PerlPoint allows you to specify another string to separate rows by option
C<rowseparator>. This allows to specify a table I<inlined> into a paragraph.

  \TABLE{bg=blue separator="|" border=2 rowseparator="+++"}
  \B<column 1> | \B<column 2> | \B<column 3> +++ aaaa
  | bbbb | cccc +++ uuuu | vvvv|  wwww \END_TABLE

This is exactly the same table as above.

If parser option I<nestedTables> is set to a true value calling I<run()>,
it is possible to I<nest> tables. To help converter authors handling this,
the opening table tag provides an internal option "__nestingLevel__".

Tables built by tag are normalized the same way as table paragraphs are.

=back


=head2 What about special formatting?

Earlier versions of B<pp2html> supported special format hints like the HTML
expression "&gt;" for the ">" character, or "&uuml;" for "". B<PerlPoint::Parser>
does I<not> support this directly because such hints are specific to the
I<output format> - if someone wants to translate into TeX, it might be curious
for him to use HTML syntax in his ASCII text. Further more, such hints can be
handled I<completely> by a backend which finds them unchanged in the produced
output stream.

The same is true for special headers and trailers. It is a I<backend> task to
add them if necessary. The parser does handle the I<input> only.


=head1 STREAM FORMAT

It is suggested to use B<PerlPoint::Backend> to evaluate the intermediate format.
Nevertheless, here is the documentation of this format.

The generated stream is an array of tokens. Most of them are very simple,
representing just their contents - words, spaces and so on. Example:

  "These three words."

could be streamed into

  "These three" + " "+ "words."

(This shows the principle. Actually this complete sentence would be replied as
I<one> token for reasons of effeciency.)

Note that the final dot I<is part> of the last token. From a document
description view, this should make no difference, its just a string containing
special characters or not.

Well, besides this "main stream", there are I<formatting directives>. They
flag the I<beginning> or I<completion> of a certain logical entity - this
means a whole document, a paragraph or a formatting like italicising. Almost
every entity is embedded into a start I<and> a completion directive - except
of simple tokens.

In the current implementation, a directive is a reference to an array of mostly
two fields: a directive constant showing which entity is related, and a start
or completion hint which is a constant, too. The used constants are declared in
B<PerlPoint::Constants>. Directives can pass additional informations by additional
fields. By now, the headline directives use this feature to show the headline
level, as well as the tag ones to provide tag type information and the document ones
to keep the name of the original document. Further more, ordered list points I<can>
request a fix number this way.

  # this example shows a tag directive
  ... [DIRECTIVE_TAG, DIRECTIVE_START, "I"]
  + "formatted" + " " + "strings"
  + [DIRECTIVE_TAG, DIRECTIVE_COMPLETE, "I"] ...

To recognize whether a token is a basic or a directive, the ref() function can be
used. However, this handling should be done by B<PerlPoint::Backend> transparently.
The format may be subject to changes and is documented for information purposes only.

Original line numbers are no part of the stream but can be provided by embedded
directives on request, see below for details.

This is the complete generator format. It is designed to be simple but powerful.

=pod

=head2 run()

This function starts the parser to process a number of specified files.

B<Parameters:>
All parameters except of the I<object> parameter are named (pass them by hash).

=over 4

=item activeBaseData

This optional parameter allows to pass common data to all active contents
(conditions, embedded and included Perl) by a I<hash reference>. By convention,
a translator at least passes the target language and user settings by

  activeBaseData => {
                     targetLanguage => "lang",
                     userSettings   => \%userSettings,
                    },

User settings are intended to allow the specification of per call settings by a
user, e.g. to include special parts. By using this convention, users can easily
specify such a part the following way

  ? flagSet('setting')

  Special part.

  ? 1

It is up to a translator author to declare translator specific settings (and to
document them). The passed values can be as complex as necessary as long as they
can be duplicated by C<Storable::dclone()>.

Whenever active contents is invoked, the passed hash reference is copied
(duplicated by C<Storable::dclone()>) into the Safe objects namespace
(see I<safe>) as a global variable $PerlPoint. This way, modifications by
invoked code do not effect subsequently called code snippets, base data are
always fresh.

=item activeDataInit

Reserved to pass hook functions to be called preparing every active contents
invokation. I<The hook is still unimplemented.>

=item cache

This optional parameter controls source file paragraph caching.

By default, a source file is parsed completely everytime you pass it to the
parser. This is no problem with tiny sources but can delay your work if you
are dealing with large sources which have to be translated periodically into
presentations while they are written. Typically most of the paragraphs remain
unchanged from version to version, but nevertheless everything is usually
reparsed which means a waste of time. Well, to improve this a paragraph
cache can be activated by setting this option to B<CACHE_ON>.

The parser caches each I<initial source file> individually. That means
if three files are passed to the parser with activated caching, three cache
files will be written. They are placed in the source file directory, named
.<source file>.ppcache. Please note that the paragraphs of I<included> sources
are cached in the cache file of the I<main> document because they may have to
be evaluated differently depending on inclusion context.

What acceleration can be expected? Well, this I<strongly>
depends on your source structure. Efficiency will grow with longer paragraphs,
reused paragraphs and paragraph number. It will be reduced by heavy usage
of active contents and embedding because every paragraph that refers
to parts defined externally is not strongly determined by itself and therefore
it cannot be cached. Here is a list of all reasons which cause a paragraph to
be excluded from caching:

=over 4

=item Embedded parts

Obviously dynamic parts may change from one version to another, but even static
parts could have to be interpreted differently because a user can set up new
I<filter>s.

=item Included files

An \INCLUDE tag immediately disables caching for the paragraph it resides in
because the loaded file may change its contents. This is not really a
restriction because the included paragraphs themselves I<are> cached if possible.

=item Filtered paragraphs

A paragraph filter can transform a source paragraph in whatever the author of
a Perl function might think is useful, potentially depending on highly dynamical
data. So it cannot be determined by the parser what the final translation of a
certain source paragraph will be.

=item Document stream entry points

Depending on the parsers configuration, these points can be transformed into
headlines or remain unchanged, so there is no fixed up mapping between a
source paragraph and its streamed expression.

=back

Even with these restrictions about 70% of a real life document of more than
150 paragraphs could be cached. This saved more than 60% of parsing time in
subsequent translator calls.

New cache entries are always I<added> which means that old entries are never
replaced and a cache file tends to grow. If you ever wish to clean up a
cache file completely pass B<CACHE_CLEANUP> to this option.

To deactivate caching explicitly pass B<CACHE_OFF>.
I<An existing cache will not be destroyed.>

Settings can be combined by I<addition>.

  # clean up the cache, then refill it
  cache => CACHE_CLEANUP+CACHE_ON,

  # clean up the cache and deactivate it
  cache => CACHE_CLEANUP+CACHE_OFF,

The B<CACHE_OFF> value is overwritten by any other setting.

It is suggested to make this setting available to translator users to let
them decide if a cache should be used.

I<Please note> that there is a problem with line numbers if paragraphs are
restored from cache because of the behaviour of perls paragraph mode. In this
mode, the <> operator reads in any number of newlines between paragraphs but
supplies only one of them. That is why I do not get the real number of lines
in a paragraph and therefore cannot store them. To work around this, two
strategies can be used. First, do not use more than exactly one newline
between paragraphs. (This strategy is not for real life users, of course,
but in this case restored numbers would be correct.) Second, remember that
source line numbers are only interesting in error messages. If the parser
detects an error, it therefore says: error "there or later" when a cache hit
already occured. If the real number is wished the parser could be reinvoked
then with deactivated cache and will report it.

I<Another known paragraph mode problem> occurs if you parse on a UNIX
system but your document (or parts of it) were written in DOS format. The
paragraph mode reads such a document I<completely>. Please replace the line
ending character sequences system appropriate. (If you are using C<dos2unix>
under Solaris please invoke it with option C<-ascii> to do this.)

More, Perls paragraph mode and PerlPoint treat whitespace lines differently.
Because of the way it works, paragraph mode does not recognize them as "empty"
while PerlPoint I<does> for reasons of usability (invisible characters should
not make a difference). This means that lines containing only whitespaces
separate PerlPoint paragraphs but not "Perl" paragraphs, making the cache
working wrong especially in examples. If paragraphs unintentionally disappear
in the resulting presentation, please check the "empty lines" before them.

Consistent cache data depend on the versions of the parser, of constant
declarations and of the module B<Storable> which is used internally. If the
parser detects a significant change in one of these versions, existing
caches are automatically rebuilt.

I<Final cache note:> cache files are not locked while they are used.
If you need this feature please let me know.

=item criticalSemanticErrors

If set to a true value, semantic errors will cause the parser to terminate
immediately. This defaults to false: errors are accumulated and finally
reported.

=item display

This parameter is optional. It controls the display of runtime messages
like informations or warnings. By default, all messages are displayed. You
can suppress these informations partially or completely by passing one or
more of the "DISPLAY_..." variables declared in B<PerlPoint::Constants>.
Constants should be combined by addition.

=item docstreams2skip

by default, all document streams are made part of the result, but by this
parameter one can I<exclude> certain streams (all remaining ones will be
streamed as usual).

The list should be supplied by an array reference.

It is suggested to take the values of this parameter from a user option,
which by convention should be named C<-skipstream>.

=item docstreaming

specifies the way the parser handles stream entry points. The value passed
might be either C<DSTREAM_DEFAULT>, C<DSTREAM_IGNORE> or C<DSTREAM_HEADLINES>.

C<DSTREAM_HEADLINES> instructs the parser to transform the entry points
into I<headlines>, one level below the current real headline level. This
is an easy to implement and convenient way of docstream handling seems to
make sense in most target formats.

C<DSTREAM_IGNORE> hides all streams except of the main stream. The effect
is similar to a call with I<docstreams2skip> set for all document streams
in a source.

C<DSTREAM_DEFAULT> treats the entry points as entry points and streams
them as such. This is the default if the parameter is omitted.

Please note that filters applied by I<docstream2skip> work regardless of
the I<docstreaming> configuration which only affects the way the parser
passes docstream data to a backend.

It is recommended to take the value of this parameter from a user option,
which by convention should be named C<-docstreaming>. (A converter can
define various more modes than provided by the parser and implement them
itself, of course. See C<pp2sdf> for a reference implementation.)


=item files

a reference to an array of files to be scanned.

Files are treated as PerlPoint sources except when their name has the
prefix C<IMPORT:>, as in C<IMPORT:podsource.pod>. With this prefix, the
parser tries to automatically tranform the source into PerlPoint,
using a standard import filter for the format indicated by the file
extension (C<pod> in our example). The filter must be installed as
C<PerlPoint::Import::E<lt>uppercased format nameE<gt>>, e.g.
C<PerlPoint::Import::POD>.

=item filter

a regular expression describing the target language. This setting, if used,
prevents all embedded or included source code of other languages than the set
one from inclusion into the generated stream. This accelerates both parsing
and backend handling. The pattern is evaluated case insensitively.

 Example: pass "html|perl" to allow HTML and Perl.

To illustrate this, imagine a translator to PostScript. If it reads a Perl
Point file which includes native HTML, this translator cannot handle such code.
The backend would have to skip the HTML statements. With a "PostScript" filter,
the HTML code will not appear in the stream.

This enables PerlPoint texts prepared for various target languages. If an
author really needs plain target language code to be embedded into PerlPoint,
he could provide versions for various languages. Translators using a filter
will then receive exactly the code of their target language, if provided.

Please note that you cannot filter out PerlPoint code or example files.

By default, no filter is set.


=item headlineLinks

this optional flag causes the parser to register all headline
titles as anchors automatically. (Headlines are stored without
possibly included tags which are stripped off.)

Registering anchors does \I<not> mean there are anchors included
to the stream, it just means that they are known to exist at
parsing time because they are added to an internal C<PerlPoint::Anchor>
object which is passed to all tag hooks and can be evaluated there.
See \C<PerlPoint::Tags> and C<PerlPoint::Anchors> for details.

It is recommended to make use of this feature if your converter
automatically makes headlines an anchor named like the headline
(this feature was introduced by Lorenz Domkes C<pp2html> initially).
(Nevertheless, usefulness may depend on dealing with the parsers
anchor collection in tag hooks. See the documentations of used
tag modules for details.)

If your converter does not support automatic headline anchors
the mentioned way, it is recommended to omit this option because
it could confuse tag hooks that evaluate the parsers anchor collection.


=item libpath

An optional reference to an array of library pathes to be searched for
files specified by \INCLUDE tags. This array is intended to be filled
by directories specified via an converter option. By convention, this
option is named C<includelib> and should be enabled multiple times
(C<converter -includelib path1 -includelib path2 document.pp>).

Please note that library pathes can be set via environment variable
C<PERLPOINTLIB> as well, but directories specified via C<libpath> are
searched I<first>.


=item linehints

If set to a true value, the parser will embed line hints into the stream
whenever a new source line begins.

A line hint directive is provided as

  [
   DIRECTIVE_NEW_LINE, DIRECTIVE_START,
   {file=>filename, line=>number}
  ]

and is suggested to be handled by a backend callback.

Please note that currently source line numbers are not guaranteed to be
correct if stream parts are restored from I<cache> (see there for details).

The default value is 0.

=item nestedTables

This is an optional flag which is by default set to 0, indicating if the parser
shall accept nested tables or not. Table nesting can produce very nice results
if it is supported by the target language. HTML, for example, allows to nest
tables, but other languages I<do not>. So, using this feature can really improve
the results if a user is focussed on supporting certain target formats only. If I want
to produce nothing but HTML, why should I take care of target formats not able
to handle table nesting? On the other hand, I<if> a document shall be translated
into several formats, it might cause trouble to nest tables therein.

Because of this, it is suggested to let converter users decide if they want to
enable table nesting or not. If the target format does not support nesting, I
recommend to disable nesting completely.


=item object

the parser object made by I<new()>;

=item safe

an object of the B<Safe> class which comes with perl. It is used to evaluate
embedded Perl code in a safe environment. By letting the caller of I<run()>
provide this object, a translator author can make the level of safety fully
configurable by users. Usually, the following should work

  use Safe;
  ...
  $parser->run(safe=>new Safe, ...);

Safe is a really good module but unfortunately limited in loading modules
transparently. So if a user wants to use modules in his embedded code, he
might fail to get it working in a Safe compartment. If safety does not matter,
he can decide to execute it without Safe, with full Perl access. To switch
on this mode, pass a true scalar value (but no reference) instead of a Safe
object.

To make all PerlPoint converters behave similarly, it is recommended to provide
two related options C<-activeContents> and C<-safeOpcode>. C<-activeContents>
should flag that active contents shall be evaluated, while C<-safeOpcode>
controls the level of security. A special level C<ALL> should mean that all
code can b executed without any restriction, while any other settings should be
treated as an opcode to configure the Safe object. So, the recommended rules
are: pass 0 unless C<-activeContents> is set. Pass 1 if the converter was
called with C<-activeContents> I<and> C<-safeOpcode ALL>. Pass a Safe object
and configure it according to the users C<-safeOpcode> settings if
C<-activeContents> is used but without C<-safeOpcode ALL>. See C<pp2sdf>
for an implementation example.

Active Perl contents is I<suppressed> if this setting is omitted or if anything
else than a B<Safe> object is passed. (There are currently three types of active
contents: embedded or included Perl and condition paragraphs.)


=item predeclaredVars

Variables are usually set by assignment paragraphs. However, it may be useful
for a converter to predeclare a set of them to provide certain settings to the
users. Predeclared variables, as any other PerlPoint variables, can be used
both in pure PerlPoint and in active contents. To help users distinguish them
from user defined vars, their names will be I<capitalized>.

Just pass a hash of variable name / value pairs:

  $parser->run(
               ...
               predeclaredVars => {
                                   CONVERTER_NAME    => 'pp2xy',
                                   CONVERTER_VERSION => $VERSION,
                                   ...
                                  },
              );

Non capitalized variable names will be capitalized without further notice.

Please note that variables currently can only be scalars. Different data types
will not be accepted by the parser.

Predeclared variables should be mentioned in the converters documentation.

The parser itself makes use of this feature by declaring C<_PARSER_VERSION>
(the version of this module used to parse the source) and _STARTDIR (the full
path of the startup directory, as reported by C<Cwd::cdw()>).

C<predeclaredVars> needs C<var2stream> to take effect.


=item skipcomments

By default comments are streamed and can be converted into comments of the target language.
But often they are of limited use in generated files: especially if they are intended to
help the author of a document, not the reader of the source of generated results. So with
this option one can suppress comments from being streamed.

It is suggested to get this setting via user option,
which by convention should be named C<-skipcomments>.

=item stream

A reference to an array where the generated output stream should be stored in.

Application programmers may want to tie this array if the target ASCII
texts are expected to be large (long ASCII texts can result in large stream
data which may occupy a lot of memory). Because of the fact that the parser
stores stream data I<by paragraph>, memory consumption can be reduced
significantly by tying the stream array.

It is recommended to pass an empty array. Stored data will not be overwritten,
the parser I<appends> its data instead (by C<push()>).

=item trace

This parameter is optional. It is intended to activate trace code while the method
runs. You may pass any of the "TRACE_..." constants declared in B<PerlPoint::Constants>,
combined by addition as in the following example:

  # show the traces of both
  # lexical and syntactical analysis
  trace => TRACE_LEXER+TRACE_PARSER,

If you omit this parameter or pass TRACE_NOTHING, no traces will be displayed.

=item var2stream

If set to a true value, the parser will propagate variable settings into the stream
by adding additional C<DIRECTIVE_VARSET> directives.

A variable propagation has the form

  [
   DIRECTIVE_VARSET, DIRECTIVE_START,
   {var=>varname, value=>value}
  ]

and is suggested to be handled by a backend callback.

The default value is 0.

=item vispro

activates "process visualization" which simply means that a user will see
progress messages while the parser processes documents. The I<numerical>
value of this setting determines how often the progress message shall be
updated, by a I<chapter interval>:

  # inform every five chapters
  vispro => 5,

Process visualization is automatically suppressed unless STDERR is
connected to a terminal, if this option is omitted, I<display> was set
to C<DISPLAY_NOINFO> or parser I<trace>s are activated.

=back

B<Return value:>
A "true" value in case of success, "false" otherwise. A call is performed
successfully if there was neither a syntactical nor a semantic error in the
parsed files.

B<Example:>

  $parser->run(
               stream => \@streamData,
               files  => \@ARGV,
               filter => 'HTML',
               cache  => CACHE_ON,

A class method that supplied all anchors collected by the parser.

Example:

   my $anchors=PerlPoint::Parser::anchors;

=cut
sub anchors
 {$anchors;}

# declare a helper package used for token "delay" after bodyless macros
# (implemented the oo way to determine the data)
package PerlPoint::Parser::DelayedToken;

# even this tiny package needs modules!
use Carp;

# make an object holding the token name and its value
sub new

  # get parameter
  my ($class, $token, $value)=@_;

  # check parameters
  confess "[BUG] Missing class name.\n" unless $class;
  confess "[BUG] Missing token parameter.\n" unless $token;
  confess "[BUG] Missing token value parameter.\n" unless defined $value;

  # build and reply object

=head1 EXAMPLE

The following code shows a minimal but complete parser.

  # pragmata
  use strict;

  # load modules
  use PerlPoint::Parser;

  # declare variables
  my (@streamData);

  # build parser
  my ($parser)=new PerlPoint::Parser;
  # and call it
  $parser->run(
               stream  => \@streamData,
               files   => \@ARGV,
              );

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Converter namespace

It is suggested to B<avoid> operating in namespace B<main::>. In order to emulate
the behaviour of the B<Safe> module by C<eval()> in case a user wishes to get
full Perl access for active contents, active contents needs to be executed in
this namespace. Safe does not allow to change this, so the documented default
for "saved" and "not saved" active contents I<needs> to be C<main::>. This means
that both the parser and active contents will pollute C<main::>. Prevent from being
effected by choosing a different converter namespace. The B<PerlPoint::Converter::>
 hyrarchy is reserved for this purpose. The recommended namespace is
C<PerlPoint::Converter::<converter name>>, e.g. C<PerlPoint::Converter::pp2sdf>.

=head2 Format

The PerlPoint format was initially designed by I<Tom Christiansen>,
who wrote an HTML slide generator for it, too.

I<Lorenz Domke> added a number of additional, useful and interesting
features to the original implementation. At a certain point, we
decided to redesign the tool to make it a base for slide generation
not only into HTML but into various document description languages.

The PerlPoint format implemented by this parser version is slightly
different from the original design. Presentations written for Perl
Point 1.0 will I<not> pass the parser but can simply be converted
into the new format. We designed the new format as a team of
I<Lorenz Domke>, I<Stephen Riehm> and me.

=head2 Storable updates

From version 0.24 on the Storable module is a prerequisite of the
parser package because Storable is used to store and retrieve cache
data in files. If you update your Storable installation it I<might>
happen that its internal format changes and therefore stored cache
data becomes unreadable. To avoid this, the parser automatically
rebuilds existing caches in case of Storable updates.

=head1 FILES

If I<cache>s are used, the parser writes cache files where the initial
sources are stored. They are named .<source file>.ppcache.
