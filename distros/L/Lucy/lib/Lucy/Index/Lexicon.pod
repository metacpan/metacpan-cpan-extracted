=head1 NAME

Lucy::Index::Lexicon - Iterator for a field’s terms.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lex_reader = $seg_reader->obtain('Lucy::Index::LexiconReader');
    my $lexicon = $lex_reader->lexicon( field => 'content' );
    while ( $lexicon->next ) {
       print $lexicon->get_term . "\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Lexicon is an iterator which provides access to all the unique terms for
a given field in sorted order.

If an index consists of two documents with a ‘content’ field holding “three
blind mice” and “three musketeers” respectively, then iterating through the
‘content’ field’s lexicon would produce this list:

    blind
    mice
    musketeers
    three

=head1 ABSTRACT METHODS

=head2 seek

    $lexicon->seek($target);
    $lexicon->seek();  # default: undef

Seek the Lexicon to the first iterator state which is greater than or
equal to C<target>.  If C<target> is undef,
reset the iterator.

=head2 next

    my $bool = $lexicon->next();

Proceed to the next term.

Returns: true until the iterator is exhausted, then false.

=head2 reset

    $lexicon->reset();

Reset the iterator.  L<next()|/next> must be called to proceed to the first
element.

=head2 get_term

    my $obj = $lexicon->get_term();

Return the current term, or undef if the iterator is not in a
valid state.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Index::Lexicon isa Clownfish::Obj.
