0.14 18 Aug 2009
 - fix svn_run command debugging

0.13_03 16 April 2009
 - Class::XSAccessor now triggers Pod::Coverage warnings if methods are
   documented. Added docs in SVN::Class::Info.
 - made stdout/stdin aliasing conditional based on SVN_CLASS_ALIAS_STDOUT
   env var. default is now *off* so that things work as you would expect,
   and the hack of aliasing them now used only when explicitly asked for.
 - added Text::ParseWords to Makefile deps so IPC::Run works.

0.13_02 10 Feb 2009
 - drop Class::Accessor::Fast in favor of Rose::Object since we already
   required Rose::Object via Rose::URI. One less dependency, plus
   Rose::Object now has an XS option if Class::XSAccessor is installed.

   bin not found.

 - another debugging release

0.08_01 4 July 2008
 - **developer release only** -- trying to track down 50% fail rate in

   File::Temp for that test, along with using local repos for author test.
