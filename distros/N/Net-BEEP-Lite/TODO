High Priority:

  * Better error condition checking.  The BEEP standard describes a
    number of conditions to check for that will result in an aborted
    session.  Currently, the package only checks for a few of them.

  * Improve the MIME handling in Message.  It is currently very lame.

Low(er) Priority:

  * various SASL profiles.

  * a multiple message send method.
