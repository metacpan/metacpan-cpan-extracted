2.0   2008-01-16

    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

    - ToOx will return an array if called in array context;
      this will break code that does 'print ToOx(..)' directly
    - The string returned by ToOx no longer has a trailing full stop.
    - ToOx will return undef, rather than an error string if a date
      requested is not in term time (if full_term or ext_term was
      specifed)
    - Parse will return undef, rather than an error string, if the
      string could not be parsed
    - ToOx and FromOx will die if the date requested is not in the internal
      database; if appropriate, you should eval calls to these functions
      and perform appropriate error handling.
    - The format of the YAML database has changed.

    OTHER CHANGES:

    - Improve documention to describe the Oxford date format and add
      references to the University (fixes RT#27365)
    - Move Calendar.pm to lib/, and test.pl to t/ (and convert to using
      Test::More)
    - General refactoring and cleanup
    - Changes from Aaron Wilson:
      - ToOx can be called in multiple modes with different levels
        of strictness (fixes RT#27366).
    - Changes inspired by Janet McKnight:
      - The module calculates the Oxford terms from the definition laid
        out in University Regulations as well as the reckoning of dates
        of full term (also fixes RT#27366).
    - Reference to CPAN RT in documentation
    - ToOx can be called with a 'confirmed' option, which ignores dates
      marked as provisional (fixes RT#31289).
    
1.8   2007-05-27
    - New maintainer: Dominic Hargreaves <dom@cpan.org>
    - Convert built-in data to YAML and add more dates
    - Support reading data from an external YAML file
    - Remove support for fetching data from University web pages, as this
      functionality is fragile and has broken.
    - Run perltidy on Calendar.pm in line with
      Damien Conway's Best Practices

1.7   2005-01-04
    - Corrected terms 2004-2006 (which were incorrectly given as 2003)
    - Term dates before 2004 are not shown on the OU website; always
      pre-load them

1.6   2004-11-20
    - New maintainer: Eugene van der Pijll <pijll@cpan.org>
    - Added terms 2004-2006 to internal database
