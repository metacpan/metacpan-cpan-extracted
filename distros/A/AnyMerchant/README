VERSION

SYNOPSIS
        my $gateway = AnyMerchant->gateway('Balanced', password => 'abc123');

DESCRIPTION
    AnyMerchant is a generic and consistent interface for online payment
    services. It is an alternative to Business::OnlinePayment. The interface
    for AnyMerchant is based on ruby's Active Merchant
    <https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant>. See AnyMerchant::Gateway
    for a description of the interface that gateways should implement.

METHODS
  gateway
        my $gateway = AnyMerchant->gateway('Balanced', password => 'abc123');

    This is a static factory method that creates an AnyMerchant::Gateway::*
    object, validates its interface, and returns it. In the above example,
    an AnyMerchant::Gateway::Balanced object is returned.
