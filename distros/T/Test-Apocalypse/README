NAME

    Test::Apocalypse - Apocalypse's favorite tests bundled into a simple
    interface

VERSION

      This document describes v1.006 of Test::Apocalypse - released October 25, 2014 as part of Test-Apocalypse.

SYNOPSIS

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;
    
            use Test::More;
            eval "use Test::Apocalypse";
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Apocalypse required for validating the distribution';
            } else {
                    is_apocalypse_here();
            }

DESCRIPTION

    This module greatly simplifies common author tests for modules heading
    towards CPAN. I was sick of copy/pasting the tons of t/foo.t scripts +
    managing them in every distro. I thought it would be nice to bundle all
    of it into one module and toss it on CPAN :) That way, every time I
    update this module all of my dists would be magically updated!

    This module respects the RELEASE_TESTING/AUTOMATED_TESTING env
    variable, if it is not set it will skip the entire testsuite. Normally
    end-users should not run it; but you can if you want to see how bad my
    dists are, ha! The scheme is exactly the same as the one Alias proposed
    in Test::XT and in his blog post,
    http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Alias/journal/38822.html.

    This module uses Module::Pluggable to have custom "backends" that
    process various tests. We wrap them in a hackish Test::Block block
    per-plugin and it seems to work nicely. If you want to write your own,
    it should be a breeze once you look at some of my plugins and see how
    it works. ( more documentation to come )

 Usage

    In order to use this, you would need to be familiar with the "standard"
    steps in order to fully exercise the testsuite. There are a few steps
    we require, because our plugins need stuff to be prepared for them. For
    starters, you would need a test file in your distribution similar to
    the one in SYNOPSIS. Once that is done and added to your MANIFEST and
    etc, you can do this:

            perl Build.PL                   # sets up the dist ( duh, hah )
            ./Build dist                    # makes the tarball ( so certain plugins can process it )
            RELEASE_TESTING=1 ./Build test  # runs the testsuite!

Methods

 is_apocalypse_here()

    This is the main entry point for this testsuite. By default, it runs
    every plugin in the testsuite. You can enable/disable specific plugins
    if you desire. It accepts a single argument: a hashref or a hash. It
    can contain various options, but as of now it only supports two
    options. If you try to use allow and deny at the same time, this module
    will throw an exception.

  allow

    Setting "allow" to a string or a precompiled regex will run only the
    plugins that match the regex. If passed a string, this module will
    compile it via qr/$str/i.

            # run only the EOL test and disable all other tests
            is_apocalypse_here( {
                    allow   => qr/^EOL$/,
            } );
    
            # run all "dist" tests
            is_apocalypse_here( {
                    allow   => 'dist',
            } );

  deny

    Setting "deny" to a string or a precompiled regex will not run the
    plugins that match the regex. If passed a string, this module will
    compile it via qr/$str/i.

            # disable Pod_Coverage test and enable all other tests
            is_apocalypse_here( {
                    deny    => qr/^Pod_Coverage$/,
            } );
    
            # disable all pod tests
            is_apocalypse_here( {
                    deny    => 'pod',
            } );

 plugins()

    Since this module uses Module::Pluggable you can use this method on the
    package to find out what plugins are available. Handy if you need to
    know what plugins to skip, for example.

            my @tests = Test::Apocalypse->plugins;

EXPORT

    Automatically exports the "is_apocalypse_here" sub.

MORE IDEAS

      * Test::NoSmartComments

      I don't use Smart::Comments but it might be useful? I LOVE BLOAT! :)

      * Better POD spelling checker?

      Test::Spelling is ancient, and often blows up. There's a
      Test::Pod::Spelling on CPAN but it is flaky too :(

      * Document the way we do plugins so others can add to this testsuite
      :)

      * POD standards check

      Do we have SYNOPSIS, ABSTRACT, SUPPORT, etc sections? ( PerlCritic
      can do that! Need to investigate more... )

      * Integrate Test::UniqueTestNames into the testsuite

      This would be nice, but I'm not sure if I can actually force this on
      other tests. Otherwise I'll be just making sure that the
      Test::Apocalypse tests is unique, which is worthless to $dist trying
      to clean itself up...

      * META.yml checks

      We should make sure that the META.yml includes the "repository",
      "license", and other useful keys!

      * Other AUTHORs

      As always, we should keep up on the "latest" in the perl world and
      look at other authors for what they are doing.

      * indirect syntax

      We should figure out how to use indirect.pm to detect this deprecated
      method of coding. There's a Perl::Critic plugin for this, yay!

      * Test::PPPort

      Already implemented as PPPort.pm but it's less invasive than my
      version, ha!

      * Test::DependentModules

      This is a crazy test, but would help tremendously in finding
      regressions in your code!

      * Test::CleanNamespaces

      I don't exclusively code in Moose, but this could be useful...

      * no internet?

      It would be nice to signal INTERNET_TESTING=0 or something zany like
      that so this testsuite will skip the tests that need internet
      access...

              <Apocalypse> Is there a convention that signals no internet access? Similar to RELEASE_TESTING, AUTOMATED_TESTING, and etc?
              <@rjbs> No.
              <Apocalypse> mmm I ain't in the mood to invent it so I'll just bench it for now :(
              <Apocalypse> however, if I was to invent it I would call it something like INTERNET_TESTING=0
              <Apocalypse> Also, why does ILYAZ keep re-inventing the stuff? Use of uninitialized value $ENV{"PERL_RL_TEST_PROMPT_MINLEN"} in bitwise or (|) at test.pl line 33.
              <@Alias> use LWP::Online ':skip_all';
              <@Alias> Whack that in the relevant test scripts
              <Apocalypse> Alias: Hmm, how can I control that at a distance? i.e. disabling inet if I had inet access?
              <@Alias> You can't
              <@Alias> It's a pragmatic test, tries to pull some huge site front pages and looks for copyright statements
              <Apocalypse> At least it's a good start - thanks!
              <@Alias> So it deals with proxies and airport wireless hijacking etc properly
              <Apocalypse> Hah yeah I had to do the same thing at $work in the past, we put up a "special" page then had our software try to read it and if the content didn't match it complained :)
              <@Alias> right
              <@Alias> So yeah, it automates that
              <@Alias> I wrote it while in an airport annoyed that something I wrote wasn't falling back on a minicpan properly
              <Apocalypse> At least it'll be an improvement, but I still need to force no inet for testing... ohwell
              <Apocalypse> Heh, it seems like us perl hackers do a lot of work while stranded at airports :)
              <@Alias> If you can break LWP from the environment, that would work
              <@Alias> Setting a proxy ENVthat is illegal etc
              <Apocalypse> ah good thinking, I'll read up on the fine points of LWP env vars and try to screw it up

 Modules that I considered but decided against using

      * Test::Distribution

      This module was a plugin in this testsuite but I don't need it. All
      the functionality in it is already replicated in the plugins :)

      * Test::Module::Used and Test::Dependencies

      They were plugins in this testsuite but since I started coding with
      Moose, they don't work! I've switched to my homebrew solution
      utilizing Perl::PrereqScanner which works nicely for me.

      * Test::MyDeps

      Superseded by Test::DependentModules. Also, I don't want to waste a
      lot of time on each testrun testing other modules!

      * Test::NoTabs

      I always use tabs! :(

      * Test::CheckManifest

      This was a buggy module that I dropped and is now using
      Test::DistManifest

      * Test::Dist

      This is pretty much the same thing as this dist ;)

      * Test::PureASCII

      This rocks, as I don't care about unicode in my perl! ;)

      * Test::LatestPrereqs

      This looks cool but we need to fiddle with config files? My
      OutdatedPrereqs test already covers it pretty well...

      * Test::Pod::Content

      This is useful, but not everyone has the same POD layout. It would be
      too much work to try and generalize this...

      * Test::GreaterVersion

      Since I never use CPAN, this is non-functional for me. However, it
      might be useful for someone?

      * Test::Kwalitee

      This dist rocks, but it doesn't print the info nor utilize the extra
      metrics. My homebrew solution actually copied a lot of code from
      this, so I have to give it props!

      * Test::LoadAllModules

      This is very similar to Test::UseAllModules but looks more
      complicated. Also, I already have enough tests that do that ;)

      * Test::ModuleReady

      This looks like a nice module, but what it does is already covered by
      the numerous tests in this dist...

      * Test::PerlTidy

      Br0ken install at this time... ( PerlCritic can do that! Need to
      investigate more... ) Also, all it does is... run your module through
      perltidy and compare the outputs. Not that useful imo because I never
      could get perltidy to match my prefs :(

      * Test::Install::METArequires

      This looks like a lazy way to do auto_install and potentially
      dangerous! Better to just use the prereq logic in
      Build.PL/Makefile.PL

      * Test::Perl::Metrics::Simple

      This just tests your Cyclomatic complexity and was the starting point
      for my homebrew solution.
