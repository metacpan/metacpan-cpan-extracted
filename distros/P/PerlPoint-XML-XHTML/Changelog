* nested lists: the wrapping list point got CSS for
  "list-style-type: none";

Several improvements, focussed on more valid XHTML output:
	
* the <embedded-(x)html> tags included for embedded parts
  made the produced XHTML invalid, deleted;
	
* index now produced as better XHTML;

* in XHTML strict, <a> has an \I<id> attribute, but no name;

* in XHTML strict, <u> is no valid tag, so now CSS is used for \C<\\U>;

* nested lists are wrapped into list points, for correct XHTML;

* \C<LOCALTOC>: nested list wrapped in list points as well;

* anchors now built as simple strings on base of MD5
  checksums, to get valid XHTML addresses;

* index relation <div> now has an own class, "_ppIndexRelated",
  for easier CSS access;

* building filenames we use File::Spec::catfile() now;

* headlines in paged output do not need anchors (as each chapter
  has its own page), deleted;


=0.03

* Bugfix: first link on a page could point to a label
  on the same page, instead to the real target.

* More portable pathes: built with File::Path now.
	

=0.02

* added the template support the previous version was
  documented to have;
	
* removed attribute targethandle - with templates, files
  can be opened by the template engine, so a general
  handling is not always appropriate;

* added buildFilename() to allow generalized algorithms
  to work - code in this class must work for child
  classes as well;

* added buildTargetLink() to build link targets in one
  place;

* fixed a letter case error - sequence anchor tags were
  written uppercased;
  
* now storing an array reference for each page in the
  slides attribute, allowing using code (like template
  engines) to distinguish pages;

* nested tables now supported;

* added first tests (POD tests only);
