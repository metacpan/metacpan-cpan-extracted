	Use Module::Load instead of require when attempting to load dependencies.
	Bug fixed: make sure we load ISA modules

	Added extract_by implementation as one of the array helpers.

0.008     2011-06-21 21:12:44 Europe/London
	Make the EntityModel::Array handling work in a more asynchronous-friendly manner. Changes
	 ->grep, ->first, ->last etc.
	Switch back to Check::UnitCheck 0.13 since the patch was accepted upstream (thanks AJGOUGH)

0.007     2011-03-06 02:37:07 Europe/London
	Don't set EntityModel::Class as parent for everything that uses it.

0.006     2011-03-04 17:12:57 Europe/London
	Return $self from plain value accessor when changing value.
	Don't warn about undefined values when retrieving from hash.
	Minor performance improvements on standard accessors and for instantiating the base class.
	Hash accessor allows non-ref single parameter to return the value for that key.

0.005     2011-02-26 18:16:15 Europe/London
	Allow watchers for EntityModel::Class::Array, raise an error if setting an array rather than going through the EntityModel::Array methods,
	 and a minor optimisation for cases where there's no pre callback.
	Array and hash entries now preserve the EntityModel::Array / EntityModel::Hash wrapper so that watchers can be added.

0.004     2011-02-09 06:34:15 Europe/London
