# NAME

Test::DBIx::Class::Schema - DBIx::Class schema sanity checking tests

# VERSION

version 1.0.12

# SYNOPSIS

Create a test script that looks like this:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    # vim: ts=8 sts=4 et sw=4 sr sta
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    # load the module that provides all of the common test functionality
    use Test::DBIx::Class::Schema;

    # create a new test object
    my $schematest = Test::DBIx::Class::Schema->new(
        {
            # required
            dsn       => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb', # or use schema option
            namespace => 'MyDB::Schema',
            moniker   => 'SomeTable',
            # optional
            username  => 'some_user',
            password  => 'opensesame',
            glue      => 'Result',             # fix class name if needed
            # rather than calling diag will test that all columns/relationships
            # are accounted for in your test and fail the test if not
            test_missing => 1,
        }
    );

    # tell it what to test
    $schematest->methods(
        {
            columns => [
                qw[
                    id
                    column1
                    column2
                    columnX
                    foo_id
                ]
            ],

            relations => [
                qw[
                    foo
                ]
            ],

            custom => [
                qw[
                    some_method
                ]
            ],

            resultsets => [
                qw[
                ]
            ],
        }
    );

    # run the tests
    $schematest->run_tests();

Run the test script:

    prove -l t/schematest/xx.mydb.t

## Options

Either `dsn` (eg `dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb`) or `schema` (an already
created schema object) must be set.

If the database requires credentials, set `username` and `password`.

`namespace`, `glue` and `moniker` define the class being tested.
For example, if your class is `MyDB::Schema::Result::SomeTable` then use:

    namespace => 'MyDB::Schema',
    glue      => 'Result,
    moniker   => 'SomeTable',

`glue` is not required if the combination of `namespace` and `moniker`
is enough to define the class, e.g. `MyDB::Schema::SomeTable`.

## done\_testing

Under normal circumstances there is no need to add `done_testing` to your
test script; it's automatically called at the end of `run_tests()` _unless_
you are running tests under [Test::Aggregate](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Aggregate).

If you are running aggregated tests you will need to add

    done_testing;

to your top-level script.

If you are running under [Test::Class::Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Class::Moose) or [Test::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Class) you will need to
disable this behaviour manually as there is no way to detect it. To do that,
set `$ENV{TEST_AGGREGATE} = 1` before calling `run_tests` or your test suite
might blow up.

# DESCRIPTION

It's really useful to be able to test and confirm that DBIC classes have and
support a known set of methods.

Testing these one-by-one is more than tedious and likely to discourage you
from writing the relevant test scripts.

As a lazy person myself I don't want to write numerous near-identical scripts.

Test::DBIx::Class::Schema takes the copy-and-paste out of DBIC schema class testing.
