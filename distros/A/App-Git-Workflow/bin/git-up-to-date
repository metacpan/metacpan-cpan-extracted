=head1 NAME

git-up-to-date - Check that git branches include latest production branch/tag

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to git-up-to-date version 1.1.4

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   git-up-to-date [am-i] [option]
   git-up-to-date show [option]

   git-up-to-date update-me [option]

 SUB-COMMANDS
  am-i              (default) determine if the current branch is up-to-date
  show              Show's the status of all active branches (ie branches with

  current           Show the current "production" branch or tag
  update-me         Merges in the latest release

 OPTIONS:
  -t --tab[=]str    Specify a tag that any branch with newer commits must contain
  -b --branch[=]str Similarly a branch that other branches with newer commits must
                    contain (Default origin/master)
  -l --local        Shorthand for --branch '^master$'
  -f --format[=](test|text|html|csv|tab|json)
                    Set the out put format

  -e --exclude[=]regexp
                    Exclude any "neweer" branches that match this regexp
     --all          Show the status of all branches not just current ones.
  -m --max-history[=]int
                    Set the maximum number of release branches/tags to go back
                    (if more than one) to find where a branch was created from.
                    (Default 1)

  -s --branch-status
                    Shows the status (name, last committer, last commit date) of
                    all branches.
  -a --age-limit[=]date
                    With --branch-status limit to only branches created after

  -F --fetch        Do a fetch before anything else.
  -x --fix          With am-i, merges in the current prod/release branch/tag

     --version      Prints the version information
     --help         Prints this help information
     --man          Prints the full documentation for git-up-to-date

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<git up-to-date> command can tell you the status of "active" branches as
compared to a release tag or branch. It does this by finding all tags or
branches that match the regular expression passed to C<--tag> or C<--branch>,
sorts them alpha-numerically assuming that the largest is the most recent.

 eg release_1, release_1_1

The branch release_1_1 would be considered the most recent. With the found
tag/branch the date/time it was created is used to find all branches that
have newer commits (unless C<--all> is used). These branches are then searched
to see if they contain the found release tag or branch (and if C<--max-history>
is specified and the branch doesn't contain the release branch or tag the older
releases are searched for).

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Defaults for this script can be set through C<git config>

 workflow.prod  Sets how a prod release is determined
                eg the default equivalent is branch=^origin/master$
 workflow.max-history
                Sets the default C<--max-history> value

You can set these values either by editing the repository local C<.git/config>
file or C<~/.gitconfig> or use the C<git config> command

 # eg Setting the global value
    git config --global workflow.max-history 10

 # or set a repository's local value
    git config workflow.prod 'tag=^release_\d{4}_\d{2}\d{2}$'
