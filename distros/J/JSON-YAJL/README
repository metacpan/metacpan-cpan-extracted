NAME
    JSON::YAJL - An interface to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation
    library

SYNOPSIS
      use JSON::YAJL;
      # see JSON::YAJL::Generator or JSON::YAJL::Parser

DESCRIPTION
    YAJL is Yet Another JSON Library. YAJL is a small event-driven
    (SAX-style) JSON parser written in ANSI C, and a small validating JSON
    generator, by Lloyd Hilaiel. This module is a Perl interface to that
    library.

    To find out more about YAJL, please visit http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/

    For the generation library, see JSON::YAJL::Generator and for the
    parsing library, see JSON::YAJL::Parser.

    This is a very early release to see how cross-platform the underlying
    code is. The API may change in future.
