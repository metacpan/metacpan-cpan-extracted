Mojolicious::Plugin::SimpleSession is simple sessions for Mojolicious apps. 
No configuration, no database, no non-core dependencies. 

Sessions last one hour, but are 'rejuvinated' each request. Session data is
stored on disk, in your systems temporary directory. Old data is automatically
culled.

In the "handler" subroutine of your Mojolicious application, add:

    $self−>plugin('simple_session');

That’s it!

Inside your application, you can now reference a hashref called 'session' in
the stash, like this:

    my $count = $self->stash->{session}->{count};

    $count++;
    $self->stash->{session}->{count} = $count;

Session data is preserved across requests for this user (identified by their
cookie).

If you need to be able to control expiry, use a database store, or
basically do anything more intelligent with your sessions, you probably
want to look at Mojolicious::Plugin::Session.
