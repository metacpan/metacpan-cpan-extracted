1.008006   2015-03-23
        - Fixed failing test due to new data
        - Re-enabled t/API/public/01-marketdata.t and 02-marketdatav2.t

1.008005   2014-10-08
        - Disabled t/API/public/01-marketdata.t and 02-marketdatav2.t
            tests, as they recently started pulling in a ton of data
            that causes problems with smokers and makes the tests
            take forever to complete.

1.008004   2014-10-05
