NAME
    Config::JFDI - Just * Do it: A Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader-style
    layer over Config::Any

VERSION
    version 0.065

DESCRIPTION
    Config::JFDI is an implementation of Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader that
    exists outside of Catalyst.

    Essentially, Config::JFDI will scan a directory for files matching a
    certain name. If such a file is found which also matches an extension
    that Config::Any can read, then the configuration from that file will be
    loaded.

    Config::JFDI will also look for special files that end with a "_local"
    suffix. Files with this special suffix will take precedence over any
    other existing configuration file, if any. The precedence takes place by
    merging the local configuration with the "standard" configuration via
    Hash::Merge::Simple.

    Finally, you can override/modify the path search from outside your
    application, by setting the <NAME>_CONFIG variable outside your
    application (where <NAME> is the uppercase version of what you passed to
    Config::JFDI->new).

SYNPOSIS
        use Config::JFDI;

        my $config = Config::JFDI->new(name => "my_application", path => "path/to/my/application");
        my $config_hash = $config->get;

    This will look for something like (depending on what Config::Any will
    find):

        path/to/my/application/my_application_local.{yml,yaml,cnf,conf,jsn,json,...} AND

        path/to/my/application/my_application.{yml,yaml,cnf,conf,jsn,json,...}

    ... and load the found configuration information appropiately, with
    _local taking precedence.

    You can also specify a file directly:

        my $config = Config::JFDI->new(file => "/path/to/my/application/my_application.cnf");

    To later reload your configuration, fresh from disk:

        $config->reload;

Config::Loader
    We are currently kicking around ideas for a next-generation
    configuration loader. The goals are:

        * A universal platform for configuration slurping and post-processing
        * Use Config::Any to do configuration loading
        * A sane API so that developers can roll their own loader according to the needs of their application
        * A friendly interface so that users can have it just DWIM
        * Host/application/instance specific configuration via _local and %ENV

Behavior change of the 'file' parameter in 0.06
    In previous versions, Config::JFDI would treat the file parameter as a
    path parameter, stripping off the extension (ignoring it) and globbing
    what remained against all the extensions that Config::Any could provide.
    That is, it would do this:

        Config::JFDI->new( file => 'xyzzy.cnf' );
        # Transform 'xyzzy.cnf' into 'xyzzy.pl', 'xyzzy.yaml', 'xyzzy_local.pl', ... (depending on what Config::Any could parse)

    This is probably not what people intended. Config::JFDI will now squeak
    a warning if you pass 'file' through, but you can suppress the warning
    with 'no_06_warning' or 'quiet_deprecation'

        Config::JFDI->new( file => 'xyzzy.cnf', no_06_warning => 1 );
        Config::JFDI->new( file => 'xyzzy.cnf', quiet_deprecation => 1 ); # More general

    If you *do* want the original behavior, simply pass in the file
    parameter as the path parameter instead:

        Config::JFDI->new( path => 'xyzzy.cnf' ); # Will work as before

METHODS
  $config = Config::JFDI->new(...)
    You can configure the $config object by passing the following to new:

        name                The name specifying the prefix of the configuration file to look for and 
                            the ENV variable to read. This can be a package name. In any case,
                            :: will be substituted with _ in <name> and the result will be lowercased.

                            To prevent modification of <name>, pass it in as a scalar reference.

        path                The directory to search in

        file                Directly read the configuration from this file. Config::Any must recognize
                            the extension. Setting this will override path

        no_local            Disable lookup of a local configuration. The 'local_suffix' option will be ignored. Off by default

        local_suffix        The suffix to match when looking for a local configuration. "local" By default
                            ("config_local_suffix" will also work so as to be drop-in compatible with C::P::CL)

        no_env              Set this to 1 to disregard anything in the ENV. The 'env_lookup' option will be ignored. Off by default

        env_lookup          Additional ENV to check if $ENV{<NAME>...} is not found

        driver              A hash consisting of Config:: driver information. This is passed directly through
                            to Config::Any

        install_accessor    Set this to 1 to install a Catalyst-style accessor as <name>::config
                            You can also specify the package name directly by setting install_accessor to it 
                            (e.g. install_accessor => "My::Application")

        substitute          A hash consisting of subroutines called during the substitution phase of configuration
                            preparation. ("substitutions" will also work so as to be drop-in compatible with C::P::CL)
                            A substitution subroutine has the following signature: ($config, [ $argument1, $argument2, ... ])

        path_to             The path to dir to use for the __path_to(...)__ substitution. If nothing is given, then the 'home'
                            config value will be used ($config->get->{home}). Failing that, the current directory will be used.

        default             A hash filled with default keys/values

    Returns a new Config::JFDI object

  $config_hash = Config::JFDI->open( ... )
    As an alternative way to load a config, ->open will pass given arguments
    to ->new( ... ), then attempt to do ->load

    Unlike ->get or ->load, if no configuration files are found, ->open will
    return undef (or the empty list)

    This is so you can do something like:

        my $config_hash = Config::JFDI->open( "/path/to/application.cnf" ) or croak "Couldn't find config file!"

    In scalar context, ->open will return the config hash, NOT the config
    object. If you want the config object, call ->open in list context:

        my ($config_hash, $config) = Config::JFDI->open( ... )

    You can pass any arguments to ->open that you would to ->new

  $config->get
  $config->config
  $config->load
    Load a config as specified by ->new( ... ) and ENV and return a hash

    These will only load the configuration once, so it's safe to call them
    multiple times without incurring any loading-time penalty

  $config->found
    Returns a list of files found

    If the list is empty, then no files were loaded/read

  $config->clone
    Return a clone of the configuration hash using Clone

    This will load the configuration first, if it hasn't already

  $config->reload
    Reload the configuration, examining ENV and scanning the path anew

    Returns a hash of the configuration

  $config->substitute( <value>, <value>, ... )
    For each given <value>, if <value> looks like a substitution
    specification, then run the substitution macro on <value> and store the
    result.

    There are three default substitutions (the same as
    Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader)

    *   "__HOME__" - replaced with "$c->path_to('')"

    *   "__path_to(foo/bar)__" - replaced with "$c->path_to('foo/bar')"

    *   "__literal(__FOO__)__" - leaves __FOO__ alone (allows you to use
        "__DATA__" as a config value, for example)

    The parameter list is split on comma (",").

    You can define your own substitutions by supplying the substitute option
    to ->new
