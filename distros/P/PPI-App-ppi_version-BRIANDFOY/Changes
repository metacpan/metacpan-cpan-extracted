Revision history for Perl module PPI::App::ppi_version::BDFOY

1.004 2025-01-22T16:43:12Z
	* need to bump the version past that for the old ::BDFOY version

1.003 2025-01-22T16:39:52Z
	* move PPI::App::ppi_version::BDFOY to PPI::App::ppi_version::BRIANDFOY.
	The legacy BDFOY namespace is still in the package, so it should still
	workout with the old name. Eventually the BDFOY one will disappear.

	* add docs to ppi_version
	* refresh distro, update email address

1.001 2021-02-07T06:32:15Z
	* Don't warn if the version is a semantic version like 'v1.2.3'

	* Handle `our $VERSION`

0.12 - 2009-06-10

	the same thing, but with output that pleases me.
