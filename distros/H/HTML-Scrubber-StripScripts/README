NAME
    HTML::Scrubber::StripScripts - strip scripting from HTML

SYNOPSIS
       use HTML::Scrubber::StripScripts;

       my $hss = HTML::Scrubber::StripScripts->new(
          Allow_src      => 1,
          Allow_href     => 1,
          Allow_a_mailto => 1,
          Whole_document => 1,
          Block_tags     => ['hr'],
       );

       my $clean_html = $hss->scrub($dirty_html);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a preworked configuration for HTML::Scrubber,
    configuring it to leave as much non-scripting markup in place as
    possible while being certain to eliminate all scripting constructs. This
    allows web applications to display HTML originating from an untrusted
    source without introducing XSS (cross site scripting) vulnerabilities.

CONSTRUCTORS
    new ( CONFIG )
        Returns a new "HTML::Scrubber" object, configured with a filtering
        policy based on a whitelist of XSS-free tags and attributes. If
        present, the CONFIG parameter must be a hashref. The following keys
        are recognized (unrecognized keys will be silently ignored).

        "Allow_src"
            By default, the scrubber won't be configured to allow constructs
            that cause the browser to fetch things automatically, such as
            "SRC" attributes in "IMG" tags. If this option is present and
            true then those constructs will be allowed.

        "Allow_href"
            By default, the scrubber won't be configured to allow constructs
            that cause the browser to fetch things if the user clicks on
            something, such as the "HREF" attribute in "A" tags. Set this
            option to a true value to allow this type of construct.

        "Allow_a_mailto"
            By default, the scrubber won't be configured to allow "MAILTO:"
            URLs in "HREF" attributes in "A" tags. Set this option to a true
            value to allow them. Ignored unless "Allow_href" is true.

        "Whole_document"
            By default, the scrubber will be configured to deal with a
            snippet of HTML to be placed inside another document after
            scrubbing, and won't allow "head" and "body" tags and so on.

            Set this option to a true value if an entire HTML document is
            being scrubbed.

        "Block_tags"
            If present, this must be an array ref holding a list of lower
            case tag names. These tags will be removed from the allowed
            list.

            For example, a guestbook CGI that uses "HR" tags to separate
            posts might wish to disallow the "HR" tag in posts, even though
            "HR" presents no XSS hazard.

BUGS
        *   All scripting is safely removed, but no attempt is made to
            ensure that there is a matching end tag for each start tag. That
            could be a problem if the scrubbed HTML is to be inserted into a
            larger HTML document, since "FONT" tags and so on could be
            maliciously left open.

            If that's a big problem for you, consider using the more
            heavyweight (and probably much slower) HTML::StripScripts module
            instead.
