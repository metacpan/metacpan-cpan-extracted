3.005     2017-07-14

   Some minor POD cleanups (missing > brackets) and fix VERSION in .pm files.
   Otherwise no code changes. Some build cleanup.

3.004     2017-07-12

   updates to official CPAN release (2.033) included:

    - [RT #120756] Eliminate a warning for an ambiguous call to
      CORE::open (first reported by Abdelbaki Brahmia). fix already in
      lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm

    - [RT #121832] fix t/resources/sample-xrefstm.pdf
            NOTE: STILL DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK

   Hyphenate_en.pm changed to Hyphenate_basic.pm, and scope of built-in
   hyphenation reduced somewhat.

   Prepare for release as PDF::Builder on GitHub and CPAN.

   All modules restore VERSION line to library format, and add $LAST_UPDATE to
   show when last time the module was manually edited. The $VERSION seen in a
   CPAN distribution will be the normal overall version, while $LAST_UPDATE
   will be the last time that the module was touched (changed). Many modules not
   previously updated with Perl formatting and POD cleanup were cleaned up, and 
   given $LAST_UPDATE of 3.004. The change of API2 to Builder and the addition 
   of $LAST_UPDATE by themselves did not change $LAST_UPDATE to 3.004.

3.003     2017-05-01   (revised: change API2 references to Builder)

   updates to official CPAN release (currently 2.032 in-progress) included
   no updates to official CPAN release since 2.031 (in 3.001)

   There are a number of changes to code, which /may/ have a negative effect on
   poorly written code (i.e., produce different results), but are believed not 
   to affect properly written code. These are the removal of "~time()" from 
   resource names, the enabling of save() and restore() for "text" objects, and
   settings being returned by certain text and graphics calls during a setting
   call. See additional information below.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/BdFont.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/Postscript.pm [ref RT #105579 and #113084 (were
     open)] remove ~time() from font resource names. It appears to be 
     unnecessary, and made PDFs non-deterministic (two runs with the same input 
     had different output), making output comparisons difficult for developers.
     Commented out lines containing ~time(), so they can be restored easily.
     **Please report any problems which appear to be resource name collisions**
     General syntax and POD cleanup of those modules, including in BdFont.pm
     giving a better prefix than "pdfkey()pdfkey()".

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm general code cleanup, some POD improvements.
     Cleaned up advancewidth() method (redundant code) and clarified options.
     Split out methods text_center(), text_right(), text_justified(),
       text_fill_left(), text_fill_center(), text_fill_right(),
       text_fill_justified(), paragraph(), section(), and textlabel() into
       lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm. This was an already-existing stub with
       only a new() method [ref RT #98540 (was rejected)].
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Form/Hybrid.pm needed to add Content::Text
     to the "use base" list.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm 
   
     Document (in the POD) paragraph(), section(), and textlabel(). These were 
     undocumented "developer methods". Also improve the code and add options to 
     indent/outdent paragraphs and add space between them. Authors were already 
     using at least the textlabel() method, and some may have already been 
     using paragraph() and section().

     Method text_left() added as an alias for Content.pm's text(), and 
     text_fill() added as alias for text_fill_left().

     [ref RT #98546 (was open)] text_fill_justified() add option 
     -last_align => 'left' (default), 'center', or 'right' to not 
     stretch last line. 

     [ref RT #98546 (was open)] general improvements to justified text. Instead
     of stretching/squeezing with hscale(), wordspace() and charspace() are
     used to fit the line. If this isn't enough, hscale() will be used as
     a last resort (as it severely distorts the characters).

     [ref RT #98548 (was rejected)] added preliminary code for line splitting
     (word hyphenation). This currently splits on soft hyphens, after runs of
     digits or ASCII letters, after certain punctuation, and within camelCase
     text. It does NOT yet split up normal words (still looking for a good
     algorithm to do that). /lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Hyphenate_en.pm added, is
     intended for English language line splitting (other languages could be
     added, including specific versions of English). THIS CODE, IN ITS CURRENT
     STATE, IS EXPERIMENTAL AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTION. IT MAY
     CHANGE CONSIDERABLY OVER TIME.

   examples/Content.pl split out examples/ContentText.pl to reflect change
     in organization. Update ContentText.pl to reflect new material.

   examples/BarCode.pl added to print out the eleven 1D barcodes supported by 
     PDF::Builder. There are many more out there (especially UPC variants) that
     it would be nice to add. Plus, there are 2D and QR codes to do. Two
     (currently empty) subdirectories added under 
     PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Form for future 2D and QR additions.
     We would appreciate if someone could check that the produced barcodes are
     correct, and if there are limits on the character set and length of the
     data that should be implemented in the code. For example, the samples for
     code 3 of 9 and code 3 of 9 with full ASCII and check digit look like 
     they might be the same, and EAN-128's text is left justified rather than
     centered. CODE 128 C doesn't seem to work with all numbers (count 2n).

     All in all, we would advise against using the barcodes until they have
     been verified. Their behavior is just too odd to be comfortable that
     they are correctly drawn, particularly adjacent bars apparently merging 
     (and separating) as you zoom in and out.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm  [ref RT #98576 (was rejected), CTS 7] clarify the 
     interactions among multiple graphics and/or multiple text objects on one 
     page. While PDF::Builder does keep the settings separate (e.g., one 
     object's linewidth does not affect another object's linewidth), output (to 
     a stream) is for an entire object at a time (in the order that the graphics
     and text objects were defined). PDF, in turn, has essentially one graphics 
     + text state, and the state at the end of one stream becomes the entry 
     state for the next stream. Also, many graphics attributes affect text 
     output. See the updated POD for more information.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  [ref CTS 7] clarify what is saved and restored
     in the graphics state with the save() and restore() methods. Note that 
     even though the text state uses many graphics attributes (linewidth, 
     linedash, etc.), the save() and restore() methods /were/ ignored (no-ops) 
     on text objects. Now save() and restore() are enabled for "text" objects. 
     See the updated POD for more information.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Util.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm [ref RT #98576 (was rejected)] add
     caution that Math::Trig::deg2rad() treats 360 degrees as 0! It cannot be
     used for closed loops such as circles and ellipses (sweep 0 to 360).

   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm  minor code cleanup (adding parens to fns).

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/ExtGState.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Form/BarCode/code3of9.pm  deprecated methods 
     (renamed or absorbed into other methods) get warning messages output.
     General syntax and POD cleanup of those modules.
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GD.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GIF.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/JPEG.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNG.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNM.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF.pm  update to remove use of
     deprecated methods. General syntax and POD cleanup of those modules.
   t/content.t remove meterlimit and hspace tests to avoid deprecated messages

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  
   lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm [ref RT #98543 (was rejected)] clarify that 
     most public methods now (if they didn't already) return $self, permitting 
     chaining of calls and more consistent behavior. There are some 37 calls
     which return specified values (other than the content object) under at
     least some circumstances. The POD has been updated to reflect these 
     changes.
    
     * linewidth(), linecap(), linejoin(), miterlimit(), and flatness()
     now return the current setting if called with no arguments, and continue 
     to return $self otherwise, permitting chaining.
     * Since linedash() is a legal call (for a solid line), linedash(-1) is used
     to return the current setting (array of a dash pattern anonymous array 
     and the offset). $self is returned otherwise, permitting chaining.
     * strokecolor() and fillcolor() return the current setting (array) if 
     called with no arguments, otherwise return $self (to permit chaining). 
     This is a minor change from old usage, if you were /setting/ a fill or 
     stroke color and immediately reading back the result /in the same call/.

     There does not appear to be a consistent way to synchronize settings
     changes between ExtGState and Content. Line width, line cap style, line
     join style, miter limit, dash pattern, and flatness can be set in both
     Content and ExtGState, but since they affect different contexts, there is
     no apparent way to transfer a setting from Content to ExtGState or 
     vice-versa. Anyway, be careful about mixing ways of making settings 
     changes.

     Keep in mind the way that graphical and text operations are output to PDF,
     and how PDF in turn processes these streams. Anything that returns the
     "current graphics state" (including text state) may not quite match up 
     with what PDF's rendering engine is actually using at that moment, due to 
     the exact order of operations (as well as Content vs. ExtGState changes).
     All changes to one object (text or graphics) should be processed in order,
     but remember that all of one object will be output first, and then all of
     the next object, and so on.

     Finally, I decided that it was important to have the value-returning
     text functions (charspace, wordspace, hspace, lead, render, rise) behave 
     in a similar manner to the value-returning graphics functions. Therefore, 
     these functions have been changed to only return their current value when 
     no argument is given, and to return $self when they are used to set the 
     value. The (new) value is no longer returned when it is set, but that is
     not expected to be a major use of the functions.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  
     Document discrepancy in formimage(), where the scale(s) needed are quite
     different for images (e.g., JPEG) and barcodes. Images are scaled in 
     pixels, and naturally display as approximately 1 point square, while
     barcodes are already scaled in points, so you want a scale of approximately
     1. Multiplying by the "image" width and height within formimage() works
     great for true images, but way overscales barcodes, requiring them to be
     manually scaled down by 1/width and 1/height. So, formimage() does not
     multiply by the original image height and width, leaving that to the user
     to do in the call (no code change). 

     Fix bug in advancewidth(), where %opts were not being handled correctly.

   examples/*
     add use strict and warnings, minor code cleanup. Change graphics context
     calls to textlabel() to text context. In most examples, needed to check
     for undefined Unicode points so as not to get "undefined value" errors.
     021_synfonts fix to page titles (fix font name).

     two examples (022 truefonts with UTF-8 diacritic and 023 CJK fonts) are
     now considered to be working properly (see README).

   /
     add examples.bat (Windows) to run everything in the examples/ directory.
     Note this is a HUGE amount of output!

     add contrib.bat (Windows) to run everything in the contrib/ directory.
     This needs to be run after examples.bat, as it uses several PDFs from
     examples run.

3.002     2017-03-21   (revised: change API2 references to Builder)

   updates to official CPAN release (currently 2.032 in-progress) included
   no updates to official CPAN release since 2.031 (in 3.001)

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm  [ref RT #98547] (was open) add %option -compress to
     new() call:  $pdf = PDF::Builder->new(-compress => 'none');. This is the
     equivalent of the old $pdf = PDF::Builder->new(); and
                           $pdf->{'forcecompress'} = 0;  calls. 
     This turns off "compressFlate" for debugging purposes, so you can edit
     the PDF file and see the actual output (uncompressed form). The default
     value is 'flate'. The internal value (forcecompress) is now 'none' or
     'flate', so any code accessing this value should be updated. 0 and >0
     values are still handled by PDF::Builder (as none or flate).
     open_scalar() call can also use -compress option.
   t/*.t tests that set 'forcecompress' to 0 have been updated to the new
     -compress flag.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Pages.pm  Where is the code for rebuild_tree()? It 
     appears to be a dummy stub. Added warning in POD not to use, and opened 
     bug CTS 3.

   examples/* have been updated and the code cleaned up. Several broken
     examples have been fixed. 024_bmpfonts has been renamed to 024_bdffonts
     (bitmap distribution format) to better reflect its purpose and reduce
     confusion about what it does. All examples retested with 3.002. All font
     listings should now be ordered top to bottom 0x to Fx.
   lib/PDF/Builder/Win32.pm  enumwinfonts() not working (CTS 4).

   contrib/text2pdf.pl [ref RT #87859] (was open) "hankivy"'s updated text2pdf 
     utility further enhanced and added to the distribution.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm  open() call changed to CORE::open() to
     stop error during certain operations.

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm  method synfont() was missing $basefont parameter

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont/bankgothic.pm incorrectly named method
     fontdata() renamed to data() for code consistency.

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Pages.pm
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm  minor code style and POD cleanup.

   t-tests.bat added (Windows) to run all t tests for mass testing

   lib/PDF/Builder/Util.pm  documented paper_size() call, add str2dim(), did
                         some general cleanup of POD

3.001     2017-01-30   (revised: change API2 references to Builder)

based on CPAN release 2.029     2016-10-09
updated to CPAN release 2.030   2016-10-13, but VERSION left at 2.029 in files
  (it's questionable whether it's good to bump up the VERSION in a file unless 
   the file has changed -- you can argue it both ways: show that a file has NOT
   missed an update, versus last version that the file changed at; I prefer
   the latter)
updated to CPAN release 2.031   2016-01-26

Content:

   t/content.t  [ref RT #98574] (was resolved) add some comments, pie() test 
     that depends on fixes to Content.pm, correct Bogen comment. Add many more
     fillcolor() and strokecolor() tests. Add nl(0) and nl(width) tests. Add
     linedash test for hash argument list.

   examples/  restore old set of examples. These were internal developer test
     cases, and provide some useful sample code, even though some of them are 
     not currently operational (it's on my to-do list). See the README file 
     for the status of known problems.

     Also include my demo program Content.pl, to demonstrate the calls in the
     Content.pm module.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/PaperSizes.pm  [ref RT #98551] (was resolved) add 
     many more useful sizes (see code for full list). These additional paper 
     sizes were removed by the version 2 maintainer.

   additional syntax cleanup:
     lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     lib/PDF/Builder/Win32.pm
     lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF.pm  and TIFF/File.pm

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/BdFont.pm fix typo in error message.
     additional syntax cleanup.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Util.pm  *HexValues() calls, pad with '0' to minimum length
     (silent error). Document that if wrong number of hex digits, silently 
     ignore the extra digits. Correct grammar in a comment. Additional 
     syntax cleanup.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  extensively updated:

     [ref RT #98545] (was rejected) formimage() permit 0, 1, or 2 scale factors 
       (add separate X and Y scales)

     [ref RT #98572] (was rejected) 
       render() restrict argument to 0..7 (int)
       arctocurve() renamed to _arctocurve()
       add POD for many calls, especially text_* methods
       general reordering of sections (POD)

     fontset() renamed to _fontset()
     textpos2() renamed to _textpos2()
     metaStart() renamed to _metaStart()
     metaEnd() renamed to _metaEnd()

     rearrange tests in _makecolor() to clarify and prevent certain errors, 
       add _clamp() to silently force numeric values to be within a given
       range (e.g., gray value 0.0 .. 1.0).

     [ref RT #98541] (was open) if bogen() is given a radius that is too small, 
       silently increase to minimum size (half the distance between the points).
       Also check that the two points are distinct and that the initial radius 
       size is positive. Clarify the POD as to which arc is drawn and where its 
       endpoint is. Fix many edge case bugs.

     [ref RT #98538] (was open) arc/pie couldn't cross 0 degrees. gave 
       _arctocurve() an optional direction parameter (default: 
       0=counterclockwise sweep) and split the arc at 0 degrees. Also add 
       detection of 0 or negative length radii for curves, or 0 degrees of 
       sweep (start angle = end angle). Restrict angles to 0..360 range.

       *** NOTE *** These functions have always been ambiguous in their
         definition. If you gave an arc or pie sweep from 60 to 30, did you 
         mean a clockwise 30 degree arc, or a counterclockwise 330 degree arc? 
         The addition of a direction parameter (pie, arc) clarifies your intent,
         but may result in different arcs than before (requiring an explicit 1).
         I considered setting the default direction based on the shorter arc 
         length probably intended, and whether it crossed the 0 degree line, 
         but adding a parameter was much simpler and easier to understand.

     [ref RT #98576] (was rejected) comments on "spline" nomenclature

     legacy grayscale, RGB, CMYK (1, 3, or 4 numbers 0-1 range) now checks that
       these are numbers between 0 and 1 (no message if changed).

     [ref RT #98535] (was rejected) restore nl(width) capability. This was
       recently removed (approximately 2.026) because it had never been
       properly implemented (was treated as nl(0)).
       
     [ref RT #98550] (was rejected) update cr()'s POD to better explain how
       it works.

     [ref RT #98544] (resolved) Update POD for linedash() to clarify how to
       use a hash pattern. Note that arbitrary dash/gap pattern lengths are
       permitted, as is an offset into the pattern.

(see Changes-ver_2 for changes to PDF::API2 up through 2.031)
