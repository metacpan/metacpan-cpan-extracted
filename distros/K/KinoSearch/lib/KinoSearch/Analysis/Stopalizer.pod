=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Analysis::Stopalizer - Suppress a "stoplist" of common words.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $stopalizer = KinoSearch::Analysis::Stopalizer->new(
        language => 'fr',
    );
    my $polyanalyzer = KinoSearch::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new(
        analyzers => [ $case_folder, $tokenizer, $stopalizer, $stemmer ],
    );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

A "stoplist" is collection of "stopwords": words which are common enough to
be of little value when determining search results.  For example, so many
documents in English contain "the", "if", and "maybe" that it may improve
both performance and relevance to block them.

Before filtering stopwords:

    ( "i", "am", "the", "walrus" ) 

After filtering stopwords:

    ( "walrus" )

Stopalizer provides default stoplists for several languages, courtesy of
the Snowball project (<http://snowball.tartarus.org>), or you may supply
your own.
