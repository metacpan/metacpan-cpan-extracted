0.201	2013-09-30

 [ Packaging ]
 - Use Dist::Inkt.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Use Exporter::Tiny instead of Exporter::TypeTiny.

0.200	2013-05-24

 [ Documentation ]
 - Document relationship with Type::Tiny.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Skip tests involving given/when, smart match, and lexical $_ in Perl >=
   5.17.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Deprecate Scalar::Does::MooseTypes.
 - Updated: Use Exporter::TypeTiny instead of Sub::Exporter.
 - Updated: Use Type::Tiny and Types::Standard to perform type checking for
   built-in Scalar::Does roles, and also Scalar::Does::MooseTypes roles.

0.102	2013-03-10

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Scalar::Util version in lib/Scalar/Does.pm and meta/makefile.pret should
   match.

0.101	2013-03-08

 [ Documentation ]
 - Show how IO::Detect's constants can be used with Scalar::Does's does()
   function.

 [ Other ]
 - IO::Detect now performs the same namespace::clean trickery as
   Scalar::Does to fake lexical subs.
 - Improve test suite cleanliness; use Test::Requires, etc.
 - does($class, $overloaded_operation) no longer returns true.
   does($instance, $overloaded_operation) still works of course!
 - use lexical::underscore instead of directly mucking around with
   PadWalker.

0.100	2013-03-07

 [ Packaging ]
 - Merge IO-Detect distribution into Scalar-Does.
 - The IO-Detect-Changes.txt file lists changes to the IO-Detect
   distribution prior to merge.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: New test case for IO::Detect/Path::Tiny interaction.

0.011_01	2012-12-15

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Attempt to fix some problems CPAN smoke tests are reporting in
   09warnings.t.

0.010	2012-12-05

 [ Documentation ]
 - Add documentation for test suite.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Perl 5.17 has changed the behaviour of UNIVERSAL::can($pkg,
   'can'), so that it is no longer useful for detecting whether a package
   is loaded. Changed Scalar::Does::MooseLike to avoid this idiom.
   Fixes RT#81622.

0.009	2012-11-05	Gunpowder, treason and plot

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Skip test '10underscore.t' on Perl 5.008 as it doesn't support lexical
   $_.
 - use if $] < 5.010, 'UNIVERSAL::DOES'.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Requires UNIVERSAL::DOES in Perl < 5.010.

0.008	2012-10-27

 [ Documentation ]
 - Remove references to Object-DOES in documentation.
 - Revise documentation about Role::Tiny/Moo::Role's lack of DOES; it is

   now check $_.
