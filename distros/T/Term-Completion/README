Term-Completion version 1.00
============================

Term::Completion - read one line of user input, with convenience functions

Term::Completion is an extensible, highly configurable replacement for the
venerable L<Term::Complete> package. It is object-oriented and thus allows
subclassing. See the POD in lib/Term/Completion.pm for details.

TODO
====

- get_choices() should use a cache (in T:C:Path), which is invalidated by 
  typing of BS or ordinary characters

- write a T:C:MultiPath, allowing entry or several paths (separated by blanks)
  ...and figure out how to efficiently implement CTRL-W in that situation

- works on Windows with Term::ReadKey?
  No, it doesn't. Need to investigate how to do single key reads on Win.
