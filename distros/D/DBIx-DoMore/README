SYNOPSIS
        use DBI;
        use DBIx::DoMore;
    
        my $create = <<'SQL';
        CREATE TABLE parent(a, b, c   , d    );
        CREATE TABLE child (x, y, "w;", "z;z");
        CREATE TRIGGER "check;delete;parent;" BEFORE DELETE ON parent WHEN
            EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM child WHERE old.a = x AND old.b = y)
        BEGIN
            SELECT RAISE(ABORT, 'constraint failed;');
        END;
        INSERT INTO parent (a, b, c, d) VALUES ('pippo;', 'pluto;', NULL, NULL)
        SQL
    
        my $dbh = DBI->connect( 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=my.db', '', '' );
    
        my $batch = DBIx::DoMore->new( dbh => $dbh );
    
        # Multiple SQL statements in a single call
        my @results = $batch->do( $create );
    
        print scalar(@results) . ' statements successfully executed!';
        # 4 statements successfully executed!

WARNING
    This module has been DEPRECATED. For new development, please use
    DBIx::MultiStatementDo instead.

DESCRIPTION
    Some DBI drivers don't support the execution of multiple statements in a
    single "do()" call. This module tries to overcome such limitation,
    letting you execute any number of SQL statements (of any kind, not only
    DDL statements) in a single batch, with any DBI driver.

    Here is how DBIx::DoMore works: behind the scenes it parses the SQL
    code, splits it into the atomic statements it is composed of and
    executes them one by one. The logic used to split the SQL code is more
    sophisticated than a raw "split" on the ";" (semicolon) character, so
    that DBIx::DoMore is able to correctly handle the presence of the
    semicolon inside identifiers, values or "BEGIN..END" blocks, as shown in
    the synopsis above.

    Automatic transactions support is offered by default, so that you'll
    have the *all-or-nothing* behaviour you would probably expect; if you
    prefer, you can anyway disable it and manage the transactions yourself.

METHODS
  "new"
    *   "DBIx::DoMore->new( %options )"

    *   "DBIx::DoMore->new( \%options )"

    It creates and returns a new DBIx::DoMore object. It accepts its options
    either as an hash or an hashref.

    The following options are recognized:

    *   "dbh"

        The database handle object as returned by DBI::connect(). This
        option is required.

    *   "rollback"

        A boolean option which enables (when true) or disables (when false)
        automatic transactions. It is set to a true value by default.

  "do"
    *   "$batch->do( $sql_string )"

    This is the method which actually executes the SQL statements against
    your db. It takes a string containing one or more SQL statements and
    executes them one by one, in the same order they appear in the given SQL
    string.

    In list context, it returns a list containing the values returned by the
    DBI "do" call on each single atomic statement.

    If the "rollback" option has been set (and therefore automatic
    transactions are enabled), in case one of the atomic statements fails,
    all of the other succeeding statements executed so far, if any exists,
    are rolled back and the method (immediately) returns an empty list
    (since no statement has been actually committed).

    If the "rollback" option is set to a false value (and therefore
    automatic transactions are disabled), the method immediately returns at
    the first failing statement as above, but it does not roll back any
    prior succeeding statement, and therefore a list containing the values
    returned by the statement executed so far is returned (and these
    statements are actually committed to the db, if "$dbh->{AutoCommit}" is
    set).

    In scalar context it returns, regardless of the value of the "rollback"
    option, "undef" if any of the atomic statements fails, or a true value
    if all of the atomic statements succeed.

    Note that to activate the automatic transactions you don't have to do
    anything other than setting the "rollback" option to a true value (or
    simply do nothing, as it is the default): DBIx::DoMore will
    automatically (and temporarily, via "local") set "$dbh->{AutoCommit}"
    and "$dbh->{RaiseError}" as needed. No other database handle attribute
    is touched, so that you can for example set "$dbh->{PrintError}" and
    enjoy its effect in case of a failing statement.

    If you want to disable automatic transactions and manage them by
    yourself, you can do something along this:

        my $batch = DBIx::DoMore->new(
            dbh      => $dbh,
            rollback => 0
        );
    
        my @results;
    
        $batch->dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
        $batch->dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
        eval {
            @results = $batch->do( $sql_string );
            $batch->dbh->commit;
            1
        } or eval { $batch->dbh->rollback };

  "dbh"
    *   "$batch->dbh"

    *   "$batch->dbh( $new_dbh )"

        Getter/setter method for the "dbh" option explained above.

  "rollback"
    *   "$batch->rollback"

    *   "$batch->rollback( $boolean )"

        Getter/setter method for the "rollback" option explained above.

  "split"
    *   "DBIx::DoMore->split( $sql_string )"

    This is the method used internally to split the given SQL string into
    its atomic statements.

    It returns a list of strings containing the code of each atomic
    statement, in the same order they appear in the given SQL string.

    You shouldn't care about it, unless you want to bypass all the other
    functionality offered by this module and do it by yourself, in which
    case you can use it as a class method, like this:

        $dbh->do($_) foreach DBIx::DoMore->split( $sql_string );
