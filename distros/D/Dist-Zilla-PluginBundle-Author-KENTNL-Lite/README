Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL::Lite

This is an attempt at one way of solving a common problem when
contributing to things built with "Dist::Zilla".

This is done by assuming that the code base that its targeting will
NEVER be released in its built form, but close enough to the normal
build method that it's suitable for testing and contributing.

*   Less install time dependencies

*   More phases in the "PluginBundle" generation are 'optional'

*   Less points of failure

Good examples of things I've experienced in this category are the 2
following ( But awesome ) plug-ins that I use everywhere.

  The "::Git" Plug-ins

These plug-ins are great, don't get me wrong, but they pose a barrier
for people on Win32, and in fact, anyone without a copy of Git
installed, ( Its hard enough getting a copy of the pre-release source
without Git, but that's available in "tar.gz" and ".zip" on "github" ).

Working Copies of Git plug-ins are also nonessential if you're not
building releases.

  The "::Twitter" Plug-in

Also, a handy plug-in to have, but you're not going to be needing it
unless you're tweeting a release, and usually, that means you're me.

Some of its dependencies have been known to fail tests on Windows
platforms, and thus block automatic installation, so seeing you don't
have any use for this, its sensible to leave it out.
