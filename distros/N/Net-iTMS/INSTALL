INSTALL

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install (as root to install system-wide)

To install to a different directory (if you're not root, for example),
use the

    --install_path lib=~/lib/perl

and/or

    --install_path libdoc=~/man/man3

options to the install step.  The above paths are just examples.
See the Module::Build documentation for more information.
