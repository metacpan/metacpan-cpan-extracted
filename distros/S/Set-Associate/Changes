 [API Changes]
 - 0.001000 syntax fully deprecated
 - `::NewKey` and `::RefillItems` are now mostly proxy packages, class methods defer to dedicated packages,
 - `::NewKey` and `::NewKey::*` are things that `do` `Set::Associate::Role::NewKey`, and conformance to this role is
   now reqired for `on_new_key`, not `isa Set::Associate::NewKey`
 - `::RefillItems` and `::RefillItems::*` are things that `do` `Set::Associate::Role::RefillItems`, and conformance to
   this role is now reqired for `on_items_empty`, not `isa Set::Associate::RefillItems`
 - `on_items_empty` is now a mandatory argument
 - `run` is no longer the public method for `::NewKey`, use `get_assoc`
 - `run` is no longer the public method for `::RefillItems`, use `get_all`

 [Internals]
 - Code shifted from Moo to Moose, because we want Parameterised Roles, so may as well go the whole cow.
 - Hand-written Accessors now replaced by Moose native traits
 - `items` and `items_elements` on the main class now gone.

0.002000 2013-02-27T17:35:56Z
 [API Changes]
 - Set::Associate should no longer be passed an `items` value, instead, those should be passed to the `on_items_empty`
   handler constructor.
 - `items` support temporarily forwarded for you till 0.3.0 at least
 - ::NewKey and ::RefillItems now only should have their sugars accessed via method style, ie: ::NewKey->linear_wrap()

 [minor bugfix]
 - I accidentally released the previous version with a version of Dist::Zilla that *wasn't* immune to v5.16 package
   declarations. Unfortunately, my patches haven't landed upstream yet, so working on a local build.

0.001000 2013-02-25T11:47:01Z
 - First version.
