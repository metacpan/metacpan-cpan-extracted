(This example is included as L<F<synopsis.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Net-IPv6Addr-0.93/examples/synopsis.pl> in the distribution.)


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Net::IPv6Addr> checks strings for valid IPv6 addresses, as specified
in L<RFC1884|/RFCs>, and converts addresses into various formats. It
is able to process addresses formatted in the following styles;

=over

=item preferred form: x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x

=item zero-compressed form: the infamous double-colon.  

Too many pattern matches to describe in this margin.

=item	mixed IPv4/IPv6 format: x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d

=item	mixed IPv4/IPv6 with compression: ::d.d.d.d or ::FFFF:d.d.d.d

=item	base-85-encoded: [0-9A-Za-z!#$%&()*+;<=>?@^_`{|}~-]{20}

(This encoding was given in L<RFC1924|/RFCs> as an April Fool's joke.)

=back

=head1 METHODS AND FUNCTIONS

Several of the following serve as both object methods and standalone
functions.

=head2 new

    my $ni = Net::IPv6Addr->new ('dead:beef:cafe:babe::f0ad');

Create a new Net::IPv6Addr object from a string. Internally, the
object is a blessed array reference containing the eight parts of the
address as integers.

=head3 Parameters

A string to be interpreted as an IPv6 address.

=head3 Returns

A C<Net::IPv6Addr> object if successful.

=head3 Notes

Throws an exception if the string isn't a valid address.

=head2 ipv6_parse

    my ($ni, $pl) = ipv6_parse ('dead:beef:cafe:babe::f0ad');

=head3 Parameters

Either a string containing an IPv6 address string, which may also
include a C</> character and a numeric prefix length,

    my ($x, $y) = ipv6_parse ("a::/24");

or an IPv6 address string, with an optional second argument consisting
of a numeric prefix length:

    my ($x, $y) = ipv6_parse('a::', '24');

=head3 Returns

Called in array context, the return value is a list consisting of the
address string and the prefix, if it parses correctly. Called in
scalar context, the address and prefix are concatenated with "/".

=head3 Notes

Throws an exception on malformed input.

=head2 is_ipv6

    my $niok = is_ipv6 ('dead:beef:cafe:babe::f0ad');

=head3 Parameters

Identical to L</ipv6_parse>.

=head3 Returns

This returns the return value of L</ipv6_parse>, called in scalar
context, if it does parse out correctly, otherwise it returns
C<undef>. Unlike L</ipv6_parse>, C<is_ipv6> does not throw exceptions.

=head2 ipv6_chkip

    my $niok = ipv6_chkip ('dead:beef:cafe:babe::f0ad');

=head3 Parameters

An IPv6 address string, without a prefix.

=head3 Returns

A true value if it's a valid address; a false value if not.

=head2 to_string_preferred

    
    use Net::IPv6Addr 'to_string_preferred';
    print to_string_preferred ('dead:beef:cafe:babe::f0ad');


produces output

    dead:beef:cafe:babe:0:0:0:f0ad

(This example is included as L<F<preferred.pl>|https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Net-IPv6Addr-0.93/examples/preferred.pl> in the distribution.)


=head3 Parameters

If used as an object method, none; if used as a subroutine,
an IPv6 address string in any format.

=head3 Returns

The IPv6 address, formatted in the "preferred" way (as detailed by
RFC1884).

=head3 Notes

Invalid input will generate an exception.

    use Net::IPv6Addr 'to_string_compressed';
    print to_string_compressed ('dead:beef:0000:0000:0000:0000:cafe:babe');

=head3 Parameters

If used as an object method, none; if used as a subroutine,
an IPv6 address string in any format.

=head3 Returns

The IPv6 address in the "compressed" format detailed by L<RFC1884|/RFCs>.

=head3 Notes

Invalid input will generate an exception.

an IPv6 address string in any format.

=head3 Returns

The IPv6 address in the IPv4 format detailed by L<RFC1884|/RFCs>.

an IPv6 address string in any format.

=head3 Returns

The IPv6 address in the compressed IPv4 format detailed by

Invalid input (such as an address that was not originally IPv4)
will generate an exception.

=head1 HISTORY

This module was originally written by Tony Monroe in 2001 to simplify
the task of maintaining DNS records after he set himself up with
Freenet6.

In 2017 the module was adopted by Ben Bullock with the help of Neil
Bowers as part of "CPAN day".

Exporting of some functions was added in version 0.8.

For version 0.91, IPv6 validating tests and an IPv4 validating regexp
were taken from L<Regexp::IPv6> by Salvador Fandiño García.

From version 0.92, the valid format consisting of a
compressed-but-non-zero six-element IPv6 followed by an IPv4, such as
C<fe80::204:61ff:254.157.241.86>, is accepted by the module.
