            * Fix error: "Don't know how to deal with an undetermined Perl
              reference".
            * Fix compilation error in 0.76 release.
            * Compatibility with perl 5.14.

0.000076    2019-04-08
            * Fix handling of large integers between Perl and JS.

0.000075    2019-01-31
            * Fix memory leak associated to checking for cyclic data.
            * Properly cleanup duktape stack in several cases.
            * Add test for calling Perl callback with non-Perl args.
            * Support passing Perl objects with magic into JS.
            * Allow proper dying from perl module handlers.

0.000074    2018-09-11
            * Treat references with more care:
              + Recursively dereference any references.
              + For \0 and \1, convert into false and true.
              + For any other references, use the underlying data.
            * Allow passing blessed objects to JS and back; ignore the fact
              that they are blessed and treat them as data.
            * Improve tests.

0.000073    2018-09-10
            * Bring back dispatch_function_in_event_loop() to have an easy
              migration path from this to eval(); we will remove it soon.

0.000072    2018-08-30
            * Get rid of parse_js_stacktrace -- too specific.

0.000071    2018-08-28
            * Convert JS booleans into JSON::PP::Boolean objects.
              This allows us to roundtrip, especially for cases such as
              reading a JSON file in JS (which will likely use booleans)
              and passing that to / from Perl.
            * Get rid of dispatch_function_in_event_loop().  It is
              actually better that calling eval() always tries to
              dispatch any pending timers after running the requested code.

0.000070    2018-07-30
            * Fix compilation on threaded perls.

            * Add method reset() to reset the VM to pristine conditions.

            * Make release script more generic -- Duktape vs V8.
            * Minor test improvements.
            * Update ppport.h.

0.000067    2018-06-10
            * Be explicit about imports from Test::Output.

0.000066    2018-06-10
            * Allow saying which files should be prioritised for a stack trace.
            * Cleanup eventloop implementation, removing code that deals with
              files and sockets, since we don't actually use that.
            * Remove test dependencies on Ref::Util, it stopped working on my
              laptop for some reason... :-(.
            * Made tests easier to compare with tests for JavaScript::V8::XS.
            * Add more tests.

0.000065    2018-06-08
            * Fix some linux warnings.

0.000064    2018-06-08
            * Avoid using stuff that will make linux compilatio fail.

            * Embed all required JS code into the module.

0.000062    2018-06-07
            * Add support for sandboxing: when creating the duktape object, you
              can now specify limits for how much memory will be allocated, and
              how long a duktape operation can run before aborting.
            * Add more specific types returned by typeof.
            * Support data structures with cycles, both in Perl and duktape.
            * Add more error checking when gathering stats.
            * Several Code refactorings.
            * Fixed and improved documentation.

0.000061    2018-05-30
            * Stop declaring variables inside a for loop -- doh.

0.000060    2018-05-30
            * Add new methods: exists, typeof, instanceof and run_gc.
            * Allow get, exists, typeof and instanceof to work on global
              objects and on object properties.
            * Add support for node-like modules.
            * Fix hash keys with UTF8 characters.
            * Add a REPL in bin/duktape-repl.
            * Refactor C code and split into multiple files.

            * Mark Perl strings as UTF-8 always.

0.000051    2018-04-25
            * Add test-time dependencies.

            * Add routines reset_stats and reset_msgs.
            * Add routine to parse a JS stacktrace and get structured
              information from it.

0.000049    2018-04-23
            * Greatly improved docs.

0.000048    2018-04-19
            * Unify error checking after calling a JS function.

0.000047    2018-04-19
            * Stop forcing all console output to stderr.

0.000046    2018-04-19

0.000045    2018-04-18

              log the messages.
            * Add option to grab console messages and stash them.

0.000044    2018-04-17
            * Add an optional parameter to eval, to specify a JS file name for
              stack traces
            * Print a JS stack trace to the console when running JS throws
              errors.

0.000043    2018-04-16
            * Bubble-up to the console any errors that happen in setTimeout.
            * Fix pointers to github repo.

0.000042    2018-04-13
            * Add test-time dependencies.

            * Send all console output to stderr by default.

0.000039    2018-04-12
            * Add support for gathering and returning stats for JS compilation
              and running (both time and memory usage).

0.000038    2018-04-10
            * Add support for JS console.

0.000037    2018-04-10
            * Split JS code compilation and running.

            * Add method dispatch_function_in_event_loop to call a function
              inside an actual event loop; this makes setTimeout actually work.

0.000033    2018-03-28
            * Switch to an almost pure C-based implementation of setInterval.

0.000032    2018-03-26
