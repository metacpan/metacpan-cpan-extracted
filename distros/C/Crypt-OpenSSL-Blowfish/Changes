0.08 -- Mon Nov 27 23:07:38 AST 2023

    [Legacy Notice]

    other encryption methods.

    [Compatibility Notice]
    This version maintains compatibility with the older versions.
    However, this is not fully compatible with openssl's bf-ecb cipher.
    See the documentation relating to how to use the compatible version.

    - OpenSSL 3 has deprecated the use of low-level functions.
    - Update to use OpenSSL v3 EVP_ api for openssl >= 3.0.0
    - Significant changes to the module while retaining compatibity with
      the previous versions.  As Blowfish is now outdated and considered
      legacy by OpenSSL this rewrite was done out of interest not necessity.
