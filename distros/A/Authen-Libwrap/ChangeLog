0.20    Wed Dec 17 2003
        - re-org directories to fit current CPAN standards
        - switch from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build
        - first shot at figuring out where libwrap is automatically
        - minor pod fixup
        - move test suite inline and use Test::More functionality
        - removed AUTOLOAD constants and use plain Perl constants
        - switched from DynaLoader to XSLoader
        - moved hosts_ctl into the module and changed the XS function
          name to _hosts_ctl to provide alternate Perl function
          signatures
        - added the ability to get hostname and ip address information
          from an IO::Socket, a GLOB or GLOBREF

0.10    Tue Feb 13 2001
        - Three years and *still* nobody wrote something like this ? 
        - Cleaned up a bit, verified on FreeBSD 4.
        - renamed from TCP_Wrappers to Authen::Libwrap in prep for
	      distribution on CPAN

[...]   History unknown.  Module never received much fedback, so it wasn't
        uploaded to CPAN.
