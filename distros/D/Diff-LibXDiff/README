    Diff::LibXDiff - Calculate a diff with LibXDiff (via XS)

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use Diff::LibXDiff;

        my $string1 = <<_END_

        my $string2 = <<_END_
        apple
        grape
        cherry
        lime
        _END_

        my $diff = Diff::LibXDiff->diff( $string1, $string2 )
        my $bin_diff = Diff::LibXDiff->bdiff( $bin_string1, $bin_string2 )

        # $diff is ...

DESCRIPTION
    Diff::LibXDiff is a binding of LibXDiff
    (<http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html>) to Perl via XS

    LibXDiff is the basis of the diff engine for git

METHODS
  $diff = Diff::LibXDiff->diff( $string1, $string2 )
    Calculate the textual diff of $string1 and $string2 and return the
    result as a string

  $patched = Diff::LibXDiff->patch( $original, $patch )
  ( $patched, $rejected ) = Diff::LibXDiff->patch( $original, $patch )
    Calculate the patched string given an original string and a patch string

    If the patching algorithm cannot place a hunk, it will return a second
    "rejected" result (if called in list context)

  $bdiff = Diff::LibXDiff->bdiff( $bin1, $bin2 )
    Calculate the binary diff of $bin1 and $bin2 and return result as a
    string

  $bpatched = Diff::LibXDiff->bpatch( $original, $patch )
    Calculate the patched binary given an original string and a patch string
