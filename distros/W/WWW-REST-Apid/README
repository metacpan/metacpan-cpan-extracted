NAME
    apid - Generic REST API Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     Usage: apid [ -c file ] [ -f ] { command }
      -c file         Specify configuration file (instead of apid.conf)
      -f              Run in the foreground (don't detach)

     Possible commands are:
      start      Starts a new apid if there isn't one running already
      stop       Stops a running apid
      reload     Causes a running apid to reload it's config file.
                 Starts a new one if none is running.
      restart    Stops a running apid if one is running. Starts a new one.
      check      Check the configuration file and report the daemon state

      version    Display the version of apid
      debug      Starts a new apid in the foreground

DESCRIPTION
    apid is a generic http(s) daemon which can be used to provide a RESTful
    web service in front of something which isn't already web aware. If you
    already have some application server or website with a service running,
    apid is of no use for you. However, if there's some arcane, weird or
    just old computing system which is accessible by perl you want to make
    available online as a web service, then apid might be a solution.

    To use apid, you have to write a perl script which maps uris to
    handlers, so you're totally free in what you want to achieve and how to
    do it.

FEATURES
    *   supports http and https.

    *   authentication via POST vars or basic authentication

    *   decorators which you can use to enable authentication or input
        validation per uri.

    *   automatically converts incoming data (post vars, json post or query
        string) to a perl structure for easy access. Handlers return perl
        structures which will be converted automatically to json as well.

CONFIGURATION
    A config file is required for apid to work. The format is very simple,
    one option per line, the value separated by an equal sign. Empty lines
    or lines preceeded with '# are ignored.

    Possible parameters:

     host       = localhost
     port       = 4433
     map        = my.pm
     apiname    = My API
     apiversion = 0.0.1
     sslcrt     = server.crt
     sslkey     = server.key

    If sslkey or sslcrt is omitted, apid will speak http, otherwise https.
    You can configure more aspects of ssl by using IO::Socket::SSL-new()>
    parameters.

MAP SCRIPT
    The map script, in the config specified with the map parameter, controls
    the behavior of apid. In its simplest form it only contains a couple of
    handlers, here an example:

     get '/date' => sub {
       my $date = scalar localtime();
       return { date => $date };
     };

    Now, start apid:

     apid -c my.conf -f start

    And access the api function:

     % curl http://localhost:8080/date
     {"date":"Wed Oct 22 20:29:50 2014"}

    Can't be easier.

  AUTHENTICATION
    To use authentication, you have to implement a login function and you
    have to tell apid which kind of auth you want.

    Full example:

     use Authen::Simple::LDAP;

     auth basic => 'my api';

     implement login => sub {
       my($user, $pass) = @_;

       my $ldap = Authen::Simple::LDAP->new( 
         host    => 'ldap.company.com',
         basedn  => 'ou=People,dc=company,dc=net'
       );

       if ( $ldap->authenticate( $user, $pass ) ) {
         return 1; # ok
       }

       return 0; # fail
     };

     request login;
     get '/date' => sub {
       my $date = scalar localtime();
       return { date => $date };
     };

    In this case we are using basic authentication which is backed by LDAP.
    If successfull, apid will return a cookie with a session id, which can
    be used in subsequent requests. However, with basic authentication this
    is optional, you may also leave the session cookie and just put the auth
    data into every request.

   ENABLE BASIC AUTHENTICATION
     auth basic => 'my api';

    The second parameter to the auth decorator is the realm.

   ENABLE POST/REDIRECT AUTHENTICATION
     auth redirect => '/login';

    The second parameter to the auth decorator is the login uri.

    In this mode, an unauthenticated user is being redirected to the
    specified uri, where the user has to POST the username and password,
    which can either be posted as a JSON string or as query string.
    Examples:

    Post auth data as JSON string:

     curl -d "{\"user\":{\"me\":\"mypass\"}}" http://localhost:8080/login

    Post auth data directly:

     curl -d "user=me&pass=mypass" http://localhost:8080/login

    It is also possible to use a query string

     curl "http://localhost:8080/login?user=me&pass=mypass"

   LOGIN IMPLEMENTATION
    In either case, you must implement the actual login function by using
    the 'implement' decorator:

     implement login => sub { my($user, $pass) = @_; ... };

    Inside, you can use whatever you want. I'd suggest using one of the
    Authen::Simple submodules.

    The login handler must return true to indicate authentication was
    successfull.

   AUTHENTICATION DECORATOR
    To enable authentication for a specific uri, add the following decorator
    in front of it:

     request login;
     get '/date' => sub { .. };

    This has to be done for every uri handler. If you leave the decorator
    for a handler it can be accessed without authentication. Example:

     request login;
     get '/date'   => sub { .. };

     get '/uptime' => sub { .. };

     request login;
     get '/vmstat' => sub { .. };

    In this example, the uris /data and /vmstat require authentication while
    /uptime can be accessed by everyone.

  URI MAPPING
    There's only one decorator call you use to map an uri to a handler: get.
    Apid doesn't distinguish between POST, PUT, DELETE or GET requests. So,
    however the uri have been called, your handler will always be called. If
    you need to distinguish between the various request types, you have to
    do it yourself in your handler.

     get '/some/uri' => sub { my $data = shift; ... return {}; };

    The handler gets passed the submitted data as its first and only
    parameter, if present. The data is always a perl structure.

    Apid expects the handler to return a perl structure as well, which will
    be converted to JSON and returned to the client.

    There are a couple of variables which are available to each handler:

    $req
        This is a standard HTTP::Request object. In addition, if
        authentication was enabled, it contains the username of the
        authenticated client:

         $req->{user}

    $res
        This is a standard HTTP::Response object. You may modify the HTTP
        return code or add additional headers to the response as you please.

    %cfg
        This is a hash containing all options of the configuration file. It
        has been parsed by Config::General.

  INPUT VALIDATION
    Apid can validate input data automatically by using
    Data::Validate::Struct. To enable it, use the validate decorator:

     request validate => { expression => 'text' };
     get '/ps/search' => sub {
       my $data = shift;
       return &ps2a($data->{expression});
     };

    The parameter to the decorator is the validator struct required by
    Data::Validate::Struct. Please refer to the documentation there for
    details.

    If input validation fails, apid will return an error message as JSON and
    HTTP response code 403.

  AUTOMATIC DOCUMENTATION
    Usually you'll want to write the documentation for your API yourself.
    For the lazy ones, there's a documentation decorator, which you can use
    to generate it.

     request doc => 'some text';
     get '/some/uri' => sub { .. };

    If apid encounters one or more documentation decorators it generates a
    documentation which is available at /doc/.

    Beware, that this documentation is very basic, however it at least
    explains if the uri requires authentication, what kind or input it
    expects (if validation were enabled) and if authentication is required.

HELPFUL CURL COMMANDS FOR TESTING
    auth to url with login requested:

     curl -c cookies -b cookies -k -v --user USER:PASS https://localhost:4443/foo/bar

    access url when auth ok:

     curl -c cookies -b cookies -k -v https://localhost:4443/foo/bar

    post query data:

     curl -k -v -d "name=foo&year=2014" https://localhost:4443/foo/bar

    post json data:

     curl -k -v -d "{\"user\":{\"name\":\"foo\"}}" https://localhost:4443/foo/bar

    post json file 'body.json':

     curl -k -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @body.json https://localhost:4443/foo/bar

    post data as query string:

     curl -k -v -d "https://localhost:4443/foo/bar?name=hans&age=2014"

    get json data:

     curl -k -v -d https://localhost:4443/foo/bar
