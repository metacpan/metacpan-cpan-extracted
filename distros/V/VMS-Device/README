This module lets you fetch a list of devices, get info on those devices, as
well as mount, unmount, allocate, deallocate, and initialize devices.

to build and test the extension. If it tests OK, then

mms install

to install it.

This beta release is fully functional, but not thoroughly tested. It may
well misbehave under some circumstances, leak memory, or die gracelessly
when passed truly bogus parameters. Use with appropriate care.

See Changes for history.
