<P>
DBD::Sprite is a DBI extension module adding database emulation via
flat-files or XML documents to Perl's database-independent database interface. Unlike other
DBD::modules, DBD::Sprite does not require you to purchase or obtain a
database. Every thing you need to prototype database-independent
applications using Perl and DBI are included here. You will, however,
probably wish to obtain a real database, such as &quot;mysql&quot;, for your
production and larger data needs. This is because emulating databases and
SQL with flat text files gets very slow as the size of your &quot;database&quot;
grows to a non-trivial size (a few thousand records or so per table).  

<P>
DBD::Sprite is built upon an old Perl module called &quot;Sprite&quot;, written by
Shishir Gurdavaram. This code was used as a starting point. It was
completly reworked and many new features were added, producing a module
called &quot;JSprite.pm&quot; (Jim Turner's Sprite). This was then merged in to
DBI::DBD to produce what you are installing now. (DBD::Sprite). JSprite.pm
is included in this module as a separate file, and is required.

<P>
Many thanks go to Mr. Gurdavaram.

<P>
The main advantage of DBD::Sprite is the ability to develop and test
prototype applications on personal machines (or other machines which do not
have an Oracle licence or some other &quot;mainstream&quot; database) before
releasing them on &quot;production&quot; machines which do have a &quot;real&quot;
database. This can all be done with minimal or no changes to your Perl
code.

<P>
Another advantage of DBD::Sprite is that you can use Perl's regular
expressions in your SQL &quot;WHERE-clauses&quot; to search through your data (ie. &quot;...where FIELD =~ /\S/...&quot;). 
Maybe, someday, more &quot;real&quot; databases will include this feature too!

<P>
DBD::Sprite provides the ability to emulate basic database tables and SQL
calls via flat-files. The primary use envisioned for this to permit website
developers who can not afford to purchase an Oracle licence to prototype
and develop Perl applications on their own equipment for later hosting at
larger customer sites where Oracle is used. :-)

<P>
DBD::Sprite attempts to do things in as database-independent manner as
possible, but where differences occurr, DBD::Sprite most closely emmulates
Oracle, for example &quot;sequences/autonumbering. DBD::Sprite uses tiny one-line
text files called `&quotsequence files (.seq). and `&quotseq_file_name.NEXTVAL
function to insert into autonumbered fields. The reason for this is that
the Author works in an Oracle shop and wrote this module to allow himself
to work on code on his PC, and machines which did not have Oracle on them,
since obtaining Oracle licences was sometimes time-consuming.

<P>
DBD::Sprite is similar to DBD::CSV, but differs in the following ways:  

<P>
<UL>
        <LI>1) It creates and works on true &quot;databases&quot; with user-ids and passwords. 
        <LI>2) The  database author specifies the field delimiters, record delimiters, 
        users, passwords, table file path, AND extension for each database. 
        <LI>3) <B>Transactions</B> (commits and rollbacks) are fully supported! 
        <LI>4) <B>Autonumbering</B> and user-defined functions are supported.
        <LI>5) Sprite supports basic two-table <B>JOINS!</B>
        <LI>6) You don't need any other modules or databases.  (NO prerequisites 
        except Perl 5 and the DBI module!
        <LI>7) It is not necessary to call the &quot;$dbh-&gt;quote()&quot; method all the time 
        in your sql.
        <LI>8) NULL is handled as an empty string.
        <LI>9) Users can &quot;register&quot; their own data-conversion functions for use in
        sql.  See &quot;fn_register&quot; method below.
        <LI>10) Oracle Sequences are supported!
        <LI>11) Numeric, Char(#), and Varchar(#) datatypes are supported and 
        completely sortable!
        <LI>12) Separate files for large "BLOB" data now supported.
        <LI>13) Your choice of <B>Encryption</B> is now supported.
        <LI>14) Storage in <B>XML</B>-format now supported.

<H1><A NAME="INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>    Installing this module (and the prerequisites from above) is quite
    simple. You just fetch the archive, extract it with
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        gzip -cd DBD-Sprite-0.1000.tar.gz | tar xf -
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    (this is for Unix users, Windows users would prefer WinZip or something
    similar) and then enter the following:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        cd DBD-Sprite-#.###
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    If any tests fail, let me know. Otherwise go on with
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        make install
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Note that you almost definitely need root or administrator permissions.
    If you don't have them, read the ExtUtils::MakeMaker man page for
    details on installing in your own directories. the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    manpage.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        NOTE:  You will also need to copy &quot;makesdb.pl&quot; to /usr/local/bin or 
        somewhere in your path.
</PRE>
<P><H2>Windows installation</H2>
<PRE>
		If installing in Windows, you must 1st install the DBI module, 
	create a DBD subdirectory in your Perl's path (run "perl -V" to find out 
	what this is), copy "Sprite.pm" to it, then copy the other files (
	JSprite.pm, OraSpriteFns.pl, and to_date.pl to the same directory you 
	created the DBD subdirectory in.  Then copy the file makesdb.pl to the 
	directory perl itself is in.  These directories (in ActivePerl) are: 
	c:\perl\site\lib and c:\perl\bin respectively.  You do NOT need to use 
	"make" or "nmake" to build DBD::Sprite!
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="GETTING_STARTED_">GETTING STARTED:</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>        1) cd to where you wish to store your database.
        2) run makesdb.pl to create your database, ie.
        
                Database name: mydb
                Database user: me
                User password: mypassword
                Database path: .
                Table file extension (default .stb): 
                Record delimiter (default \n): 
                Field delimiter (default ::): 
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>                This will create a new database text file (mydb.sdb) in the current 
                directory.  This ascii file contains the information you enterred 
                above.  To add additional user-spaces, simply rerun makesdb.pl with 
                &quot;mydb&quot; as your database name, and enter additional users (name, 
                password, path, extension, and delimiters).  For an example, after 
                running &quot;make test&quot;, look at the file &quot;test.sdb&quot;.               
                
                When connecting to a Sprite database, Sprite will look in the current 
                directory, then, if specified, the path in the SPRITE_HOME environment 
                variable.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>                The database name, user, and password are used in the &quot;db-&gt;connect()&quot; 
                method described below.  The &quot;database path&quot; is where your tables will 
                be created and reside.  Table files are ascii text files which will 
                have, by default, the extension &quot;.stb&quot; (Sprite table).  By default, 
                each record will be written to a single line (separated by \n -- 
                Windows users should probably use &quot;\r\n&quot;).  Each field datum will be 
                written without quotes separated by the &quot;field delimiter (default: 
                double-colon).  The first line of the table file consists of the 
                a field name, an equal (&quot;=&quot;) sign, an asterisk if it is a key field, 
                then the datatype and size.  This information is included for each 
                field and separated by the field separator.  For an example, after 
                running &quot;make test&quot;, look at the file &quot;testtable.stb&quot;.          
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        3) write your script to use DBI, ie:
        
                #!/usr/bin/perl
                use DBI;
                
                $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('DBI:Sprite:mydb','me','mypassword') || 
                                die &quot;Could not connect (&quot;.$DBI-&gt;err.':'.$DBI-&gt;errstr.&quot;)!&quot;;
                ...
                #CREATE A TABLE, INSERT SOME RECORDS, HAVE SOME FUN!
                
        4) get your application working.
        
        5) rehost your application on a &quot;production&quot; machine and change &quot;Sprite&quot; 
        to a DBI driver for a &quot;real&quot; database!
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="CREATING_AND_DROPPING_TABLES">CREATING AND DROPPING TABLES</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>    You can create and drop tables with commands like the following:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;CREATE TABLE $table (id INTEGER, name CHAR(64))&quot;);
        $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;DROP TABLE $table&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    A drop just removes the file without any warning.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    See the DBI(3) manpage for more details.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Table names cannot be arbitrary, due to restrictions of the SQL syntax.
    I recommend that table names are valid SQL identifiers: The first
    character is alphabetic, followed by an arbitrary number of alphanumeric
    characters. If you want to use other files, the file names must start
    with '/', './' or '../' and they must not contain white space.
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="INSERTING_FETCHING_AND_MODIFYIN">INSERTING, FETCHING AND MODIFYING DATA</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>    The following examples insert some data in a table and fetch it back:
    First all data in the string:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;INSERT INTO $table VALUES (1, 'foobar')&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Note the use of the quote method for escaping the word 'foobar'. Any
    string must be escaped, even if it doesn't contain binary data.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Next an example using parameters:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;INSERT INTO $table VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, undef,
                 2, &quot;It's a string!&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    To retrieve data, you can use the following:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        my($query) = &quot;SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id &gt; 1 ORDER BY id&quot;;
        my($sth) = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
        $sth-&gt;execute();
        while (my $row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref) {
            print(&quot;Found result row: id = &quot;, $row-&gt;{'id'},
                  &quot;, name = &quot;, $row-&gt;{'name'});
        }
        $sth-&gt;finish();
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Again, column binding works: The same example again.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        my($query) = &quot;SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id &gt; 1 ORDER BY id&quot;;
        my($sth) = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
        $sth-&gt;execute();
        my($id, $name);
        $sth-&gt;bind_columns(undef, \$id, \$name);
        while ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
            print(&quot;Found result row: id = $id, name = $name\n&quot;);
        }
        $sth-&gt;finish();
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Of course you can even use input parameters. Here's the same example for
    the third time:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        my($query) = &quot;SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = ?&quot;;
        my($sth) = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
        $sth-&gt;bind_columns(undef, \$id, \$name);
        for (my($i) = 1;  $i &lt;= 2;   $i++) {
            $sth-&gt;execute($id);
            if ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
                print(&quot;Found result row: id = $id, name = $name\n&quot;);
            }
            $sth-&gt;finish();
        }
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    See the DBI(3) manpage for details on these methods. See the
    SQL::Statement(3) manpage for details on the WHERE clause.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Data rows are modified with the UPDATE statement:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;UPDATE $table SET id = 3 WHERE id = 1&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Likewise you use the DELETE statement for removing rows:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;DELETE FROM $table WHERE id &gt; 1&quot;);
</PRE>
<P>
<EM>fn_register</EM>



<P>
Method takes 2 arguments: Function name and optionally, a package name
(default is &quot&quotmain&quot).

<P>
<PRE>                $dbh-&gt;fn_register ('myfn','mypackage');
  
-or-
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>                use JSprite;
                JSprite::fn_register ('myfn',__PACKAGE__);
</PRE>
<P>
Then, you could say in sql:

<P>
<PRE>        insert into mytable values (myfn(?))
        
and bind some value to &quot;?&quot;, which is passed to &quot;myfn&quot;, and the return-value 
is inserted into the database.  You could also say (without binding):
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        insert into mytable values (myfn('mystring'))
        
-or (if the function takes a number)-
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        select field1, field2 from mytable where field3 = myfn(123) 
        
I&lt;Return Value&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        None
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="JOINS">JOINS</A></H1>
<P>
	As of v. 0.50, basic two-table inner-joins are now supported.  For example:

<PRE>        select t1.field1, t2.field1, t1.field2 from table1 t1, table2 t2
        where t1.field1 = t2.field3 order by t2.field1 desc, t1.field1
</PRE>

This would return the three fields requested based on a set intersection 
of all records in table1 and table2 such that field1 of table1 matches 
field3 of table3.  NOTE:  This is the ONLY type of join currently supported!
You can, however add additional selection criteria and or ordering 
arguments.  You can also omit the where-clause and get a "set union" of 
the specified fields for all records of both tables.

<H1><A NAME="ERROR_HANDLING">ERROR HANDLING</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>    In the above examples we have never cared about return codes. Of course,
    this cannot be recommended. Instead we should have written (for
    example):
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        my($query) = &quot;SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = ?&quot;;
        my($sth) = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query)
            or die &quot;prepare: &quot; . $dbh-&gt;errstr();
        $sth-&gt;bind_columns(undef, \$id, \$name)
            or die &quot;bind_columns: &quot; . $dbh-&gt;errstr();
        for (my($i) = 1;  $i &lt;= 2;   $i++) {
            $sth-&gt;execute($id)
                or die &quot;execute: &quot; . $dbh-&gt;errstr();
            if ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
                print(&quot;Found result row: id = $id, name = $name\n&quot;);
            }
        }
        $sth-&gt;finish($id)
            or die &quot;finish: &quot; . $dbh-&gt;errstr();
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    Obviously this is tedious. Fortunately we have DBI's *RaiseError*
    attribute:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $dbh-&gt;{'RaiseError'} = 1;
        $@ = '';
        eval {
            my($query) = &quot;SELECT * FROM $table WHERE id = ?&quot;;
            my($sth) = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
            $sth-&gt;bind_columns(undef, \$id, \$name);
            for (my($i) = 1;  $i &lt;= 2;   $i++) {
                $sth-&gt;execute($id);
                if ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
                    print(&quot;Found result row: id = $id, name = $name\n&quot;);
                }
            }
            $sth-&gt;finish($id);
        };
        if ($@) { die &quot;SQL database error: $@&quot;; }

    The following are Sprite-specific options which can be set when connecting.

    sprite_dbdir
            Path to tables for database.
                
    sprite_dbext
        File extension used on table files in the database.
                
    sprite_dbuser
        Current database user.

    sprite_field
        Field delimiter string in use for the database.
        Default specified in database configuration file (<dbname>.sdb)
                
    sprite_read
        Field delimiter string in use for inputting the database.
        Default = sprite_field
                
    sprite_write
        Field delimiter string in use for outputting the database.
        Default = sprite_field
                
    sprite_xsl  (NEW)
        Allows specifying of a url to an xsl template to be written to xml 
        documents (when using the "xml" option).  This makes it very easy to 
        view your tables via M$ Internet Explorer browser!

        Example:  sprite_xsl => 'http://turnerville.wwol.com/jim/spritexml2html.xsl'
        
        Default is none.  Only applies if "sprite_field" is set to "xml"!

    sprite_dbfdelim - DEPRECIATED, now use "sprite_field"!
        Field delimiter string in use for the database.
                
    sprite_dbrdelim - DEPRECIATED, now use "sprite_record"!
        Record delimiter string in use for the database.
                
    sprite_CaseTableNames
        By default, table names are case-insensitive (as they are in Oracle),
        to make table names case-sensitive (as in MySql), so that one could
        have two separate tables such as "test" and "TEST", set this option
        to 1.

    sprite_CaseFieldNames  (NEW)
        By default, field names are case-insensitive (as they are in Oracle),
        to make field names case-sensitive (as in XML), so that one could
        have two separate fields such as "field1" and "Field1", set this option
        to 1.

    sprite_Crypt
        "0" by defalt.  Specifies that encryption is to be used when storing 
        the data in the flat-file.  To use, download "Crypt::CBC", and one 
        or more of "Crypt::DES", "Crypt::IDEA", or "Crypt::Blowfish".  You 
        can specify using any of the following formats:
        
            sprite_Crypt => 'my key string'
                Use Blowfish encryption.
            sprite_Crypt => 'DES;my key string'
                Use DES encryption.
            sprite_Crypt => 'encrypt=CBC;IDEA;my key string'
                Use IDEA encription, but read in table as unencrypted, then 
                write it out encrypted (great for encrypting previously 
                unencrypted tables).
            sprite_Crypt => 'decrypt=CBC;Blowfish;my key string'
                use Blowfish encryption, but write out table unencrypted. 
                This allows one to fetch an encrypted table and write it back 
                out unencrypted.

    sprite_reclimit  (aka. sprite_sizelimit)
        Allows user to specify the maximum number of records to be returned 
        by a single query.  Default is "0", which permits an unlimited number.

    sprite_StrictCharComp
        CHAR fields are always right-padded with spaces to fill out
        the field.  Old (pre 5.17) Sprite behaviour was to require the
        padding be included in literals used for testing equality in
        "where" clauses.    I discovered that Oracle and some other databases
        do not require this when testing DBIx-Recordset, so Sprite will
        automatically right-pad literals when testing for equality.
        To disable this and force the old behavior, set this option to 1.

    sprite_lock_file
        Specify alternate path/file to use for file-locking on os'es without 
        a working "flock" (ie. M$ os'es).  Default is 
        "/path/to/where/my/tables/are/Sprite.lck".  This is useful if the 
        file-system your tables are on is read-only.

    sprite_lock_try
        Allows user-specification of the number of times to try to create 
        lock-file on os'es without a working "flock" (ie. M$ os'es).  Default 
        is 10.

    sprite_forcereplace
        Forces existing Sprite table file to be deleted and recreated in lieu 
        of being overwritten.  This was necessary because the author uses a 
        Samba filesystem which for some reason does not permit overwriting 
        of files.

    SPRITE_HOME
        Environment variable specifying a path to search for Sprite 
        databases (*.sdb) files.
</PRE>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="DRIVER PRIVATE METHODS">DRIVER PRIVATE METHODS</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>    DBI-&gt;data_sources()
        The `data_sources' method returns a list of &quot;databases&quot; (.sdb files) 
        found in the current directory and, if specified, the path in 
        the SPRITE_HOME environment variable.
        
    $dbh-&gt;tables()
        This method returns a list of table names specified in the current 
        database.
        Example:
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>            my($dbh) = DBI-&gt;connect(&quot;DBI:Sprite:mydatabase&quot;,'me','mypswd');
            my(@list) = $dbh-&gt;func('tables');
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    JSprite::fn_register ('myfn',__PACKAGE__);
        This method takes the name of a user-defined data-conversion function 
        for use in SQL commands.  Your function can optionally take arguments, 
        but should return a single number or string.  Unless your function 
        is defined in package &quot;main&quot;, you must also specify the package name 
        or &quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; for the current package.  For an example, see the 
        section &quot;INSERTING, FETCHING AND MODIFYING DATA&quot; above or (JSprite(3)).

<H1><A NAME="OTHER SUPPORTING UTILITIES">OTHER SUPPORTING UTILITIES</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>        makesdb.pl
                This utility lets you build new Sprite databases and later add 
                additional user-spaces to them.  Simply cd to the directory where 
                you wish to create / modify a database, and run.  It prompts as 
                follows:
                
                Database name: Enter a 1-word name for your database.
                Database user: Enter a 1-word user-name.
                User password: Enter a 1-word password for this user.
                Database path: Enter a path (no trailing backslash) to store tables.
                Table file extension (default .stb): 
                Record delimiter (default \n): 
                Field delimiter (default ::): 
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>                The last 6 prompts repeat until you do not enter another user-name 
                allowing you to set up multiple users in a single database.  Each 
                &quot;user&quot; can have it's own separate tables by specifying different 
                paths, file-extensions, password, and delimiters!  You can invoke 
                &quot;makesdb.pl&quot; on an existing database to add new users.  You can 
                edit it with vi to remove users, delete the 5 lines starting with 
                the path for that user.  The file is all text, except for the 
                password, which is encrypted for your protection!

<P>
<PRE>        Although DBD::Sprite supports the following datatypes:
                NUMBER FLOAT DOUBLE INT INTEGER NUM CHAR VARCHAR VARCHAR2 
                DATE LONG BLOB MEMO and RAW, there are really only 4 basic datatypes 
                (NUMBER, CHAR, VARCHAR, and BLOB).  This is because Perl treates 
                everything as simple strings.  The first 6 are all treated as &quot;numbers&quot; 
                by Perl for sorting purposes and the rest as strings.  This is seen 
                when sorting, ie NUMERIC types sort as 1,5,10,40,200, whereas 
                STRING types sort these as 1,10,200,40,5.  CHAR fields are right-
                padded with spaces when stored.  LONG-type fields are subject to 
                truncation by the &quot;LongReadLen&quot; attribute value.  BLOB-type 
                fields have their data stored on separate files created by Sprite.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        DBD::Sprite works with the tieDBI module, if &quot;Sprite =&gt; 1&quot; lines are added 
        to the &quot;%CAN_BIND&quot; and &quot;%CAN_BINDSELECT&quot; hashes.  This should not be 
        necessary, and I will investigate when I have time.

	Data field names must NOT be the same as any of Perl's string operators 
	(eq lt le ge gt, etc) or boolean operators (and or not)!

		  special characters, ie. &quot;.&quot;.
	<LI>0.11  Thu Aug 31, 2000
		<BR>- Fix regex bug in Sprite.pm and add error-checking for SQL 
		<BR>- commands wo/space after table-name, ie &quot;update table-name\n...&quot;.
	<LI>0.12  Tue Sep 05, 2000
		<BR>- Show the size fields are truncated to in &quot;-519&quot; error message.
	<LI>0.13  Tue Oct 10, 2000
		<BR>- Fix CaseTableNames attribute to &quot;sprite_CaseTableNames.
		<BR>- Minor docs fix.
	<LI>0.14  Thu Oct 12, 2000
		<BR>- Added Oracle TO_DATE and CONCAT functions.  Fixed bug now 
		  allowing more than 1 argument for functions, and minor bug 
		  which stripped wild-card chars from function results in &quot;LIKE&quot; 
		  expressions.
	<LI>0.15  Thu Nov 02, 2000
		<BR>- Fix bug that caused question marks in bound parameter values to be 
		  treated as additional parameters.
	<LI>0.16  Thu Dec 21, 2000
		<BR>- Fixed bug which would not allow lower-case versions of the &quot;AND&quot; and 
		  &quot;OR&quot; operators.  Also made field-names used as right-values return 
		  the appropriate value they represent rather than just a literal 
		  string of the field name, ie. &quot;update table set FIELD1 = FIELD2&quot; 
		  should now work properly instead of setting FIELD1 to &quot;FIELD2&quot; in 
		  every record of &quot;table&quot;.
	<LI>0.17  Fri Mar 09, 2001
		<BR>- Fixed bug where types not returned for cursor after update, 
		  Fixed bug where table names not returned if space appeared after 
		  &quot;table_name&quot;?
		<BR>- Fixed bug in &quot;makesdb.pl&quot; -<BR>- was encrypting wrong argument.
	<LI>0.18  Wed Mar 13, 2001
		<BR>- Changed comparisens of literal data with &quot;CHAR&quot; fields to first 
		  pad the literal with appropriate spaces so that eqality tests would 
		  pass (to work like Oracle and the way DBIx-Recordset expects).
		  Also added new option &quot;sprite_StrictCharComp&quot; to force the old behavior.
		<BR>- Fixed bug that occasionally inserted a &quot;0&quot; instead of &quot;&quot; in numeric 
		  fields when inserting NULL.  To get the proper &quot;old&quot; behavior, 
		  specify a default of zero for each numeric field, ie.
		  &quot;NUMFIELD=NUMBER=0&quot; in the top line of your Sprite table files.
		<BR>- Added some code to check syntax of &quot;where&quot; clauses. (for DBIx-
		  Recordset.
		<BR>- Fixed a couple of other small bugs that DBIx-Recordset tests found.
	<LI>0.19  Wed Mar 21, 2001
		<BR>- Fixed problem seeing all Windows file-names due to case-insensitivity 
		  in Windows.
	<LI>0.20  Fri Aug 15, 2001
		<BR>- Fixed bug involving autocommit on statements containing &quot;select&quot; in data. 
		  Caught by Simon Elliott, Thanks!  Also fixed several other minor glitches.
		<BR>- Fixed bug forbidding sequence files in mixed-case directories unless 
		  CaseTableNames was set (CaseTableNames only applies to the file-name).
		  Also added code to display &quot;$@&quot; and &quot;$?&quot; in the error details message on 
		  -511 errors (could not [over]write file).
	<LI>0.21	 Wed Sep 12, 2001
		<BR>- Fixed AutoCommit to actually work.  Caught by Jojo Kamote Escubil, Thanks,
		  Jojo!  Also fixed another bug affecting quoted value strings containing 
		  question marks (Caught by me!)
	<LI>0.22  Mon Sep 17, 2001
		<BR>- Removed regex optimization (s///o) which caused record and field separators 
		  to not work right when one opened a database, closed that database, then 
		  opened a second database with different record and or field separators.
		  Caught by Larry Yudelson, Thanks!
	<LI>0.23  Thu Oct 23, 2001
		<BR>- Added new regex feature to allow one to capture regex matches and update 
		  field values, ie:  
		       update MYTABLE set FIELD1 = '$1' where FIELD2 =~ '(\d+)'
		  This will set FIELD1 to the 1st number found in FIELD2 in the same 
		  record.  Up to 2 matches for each &quot;where&quot; expression containing &quot;=~&quot; or 
		  &quot;!~&quot; may be captured.  $1 .. $n correspond to each set of unescaped 
		  parenthesis from left to right in the &quot;where&quot; clause.
		<BR>- Added TO_CHAR function for converting Perl &quot;time&quot; values to printable 
		  formats.  Has most date and numeric functions in the two-argument 
		  form of the Oracle &quot;TO_CHAR&quot; function, which it is designed to emulate.
		<BR>- Added some optimization for mass-updates.
		<BR>- Added many other new Oracle functions (TO_NUMBER, USER, ABS, COS, EXP, 
          FLOOR, MOD, POWER, ROUND, SIGN, SIN, TRUNC, CHR, INITCAP, LTRIM, 
          REPLACE, RTRIM, TRANSLATE, ASCII, LENGTH, SYSDATE.  All should now 
          work when selected from &quot;DUAL&quot;.
        <BR>- Selecting from &quot;DUAL&quot; should now work as expected.
	<LI>0.26  Mon Oct 29, 2001
		<BR>- Fixed bug introduced in 0.24 where tests failed not finding &quot;makesdb.pl&quot;.
		<BR>- Fixed test failure on Windows platforms (I think).
	    <BR>- Added still more Oraclish functions (CEIL, EXP, INSTR, INSTRB, LAST_DAY, 
	      LPAD, NVL, RPAD, LAST_DAY, and SQRT.  Fixed FLOOR.
	      It should be noted that these functions do almost no error-checking.
	    <BR>- Added date-handling capability to TRUNC.
	    <BR>- Added &quot;AUTONUMBER&quot; datatype to allow autonumbering without sequences.  
	      This emulates the way M$-Access(ODBC) does things.
	<LI>0.27	 Fri Nov 15, 2001
		<LI>Eliminated &quot;reserved&quot; status of special characters \x02 .. \x06 and \n 
		  by now using single &quot;reserved&quot; string pattern:  &quot;\x02\^#jSpR1tE\x02&quot;, 
		  where &quot;#&quot; can be any digit 0..9.  The purpose of this is to allow for 
		  temporarily protecting some strings while performing string searches 
		  and substitutions, ie. protecting commas within quoted literal values 
		  while splitting the encompassing string on commas as separators.  \n 
		  has previously been &quot;flattened&quot; out into spaces in order to treat 
		  multiline queries as a single line.  This is still done, but numerous 
		  regices were modified with the &quot;s&quot; option.  Please report anything that 
		  might be broken by this new release!
	<LI>0.30  Thu Jan 10
		<BR>- Fixed bug where specifying a negative number in a &quot;where&quot; clause 
		  as an unbound constant, returned all records and set the field in all 
		  records to that number (ouch!)
		<BR>- Fixed bug there double-backslashes in data inserted into a table were 
		  converted to a single backslash.
		<BR>- Added better &quot;BLOB&quot; support.  BLOB/LONG/MEMO fields no longer have 
		  default length specified as 5000 and data should no longer be truncated.
		<BR>- ADDED ENCRYPTION OPTION!  If the &quot;Crypt::CBC&quot;, and &quot;Crypt::IDEA&quot;, &quot;Crypt::Blowfish&quot; or 
		  &quot;Crypt::DES&quot; are available, you can connect specifying 
		  &quot;sprite_Crypt => 'IDEA;any_key_string'&quot; (use &quot;DES&quot; in lieu of &quot;IDEA&quot;, 
		  if so inclined).  To read in existing unencrypted tables and write them 
		  out encrypted, use &quot;sprite_Crypt => 'encrypt=IDEA;your_key_string'&quot;.
		  To read in encrypted databases and write them back unencrypted, use: 
		  &quot;sprite_Crypt => 'decrypt=IDEA;your_key_string'&quot;.  Note:  Any method 
		  of encryption that Crypt::CBC supports may be used instead of IDEA or 
		  DES, if you have the module installed.
	<LI>0.31  Thu Feb 22
		<BR>- Fixed bug which prevented one from using single-letter field names.
		  (caught by me).
		<BR>- Fixed bug which caused SELECTs to sometimes fail with psuedo-columns and 
		  functions, ie. sequence.NEXTVAL (caught by me).
		<BR>- Fixed bug that caused extra &quot;-528:Could not read/write BLOB file&quot; errors 
		  to be displayed after other errors (caught by me).
		<BR>- Added code so &quot;darwin&quot; (new Mac-OS) would use unix &quot;/&quot; separator, was 
		  using WinDOwS separators (&quot;\\&quot;) for directories (caught by Thabo).
		<BR>- Changed internal &quot;lock_file&quot; and &quot;lock_try&quot; to &quot;sprite_lock_file&quot; and 
		  &quot;sprite_lock_try&quot; respectively to allow user to override defaults.  This 
		  was requested to permit Sprite databases to exist on read-only filesystems.
		  This is only applicable to os'es originating from a huge corporation 
		  based in Redmond, VA. that don't support flock.  See the README file for 
		  more notes about file locking!
		<BR>- Added code to check &quot;Create&quot; command to make sure tables/sequences 
		  actually get created or else report error (caught by Dave Thorn).
		<BR>- Added RAW datatype (psuedonym for VARCHAR), since in Perl, any 
		  valid ASCII character can be inserted into a string.  NOTE:  Oracle 
		  requires packing and unpacking to hex!
	<LI>0.33  Fri May 10
		<BR>- Added code so "bsdos" (BSD/OS) would use unix "/" separator, was 
	  	  being treated as "dos" and using WinDOwS separators ("\\") for 
	  	  directories (caught by Sweth Chandramouli), Thanks!
		<BR>- Added ability to specify path and or extension to database names in the 
	  	  connect function (The default of ".sdb" and path ($ENV{SPRITE_HOME}/, 
	  	  "./", then $ENV{HOME}/ still apply).  If database name contains a dot 
	  	  ("."), then the ".sdb" extension is not added.  If the database name 
	  	  begins with a "/", then it is assumed to be an absolute path, otherwise, 
	  	  the dafault search-paths (described above) are applied.
	<LI>0.34  Wed May 22
		<BR>- Added beta (incomplete) XML support!  By specifying 'XML' as your record 
		  seperator, your tables will be stored in XML format instead of Sprite's 
		  usual delimited text format.  Special XML characters (<, >, &, and --) 
		  are escaped to proper XML format, ie. &lt;, etc.  Use of this option requires 
		  the installation of the Perl module "XML::Simple".  The reason this is 
		  beta is because I'm a newbe to XML and have not yet been able to get 
		  all binary data to work correctly, namely high-ascii characters.  If 
		  you see what I am missing, please feel free to tell me and or send 
		  patches!
		<BR>- Fixed bug where single-quotes appearing in fields in UPDATE statements 
		  caused -517 errors.
		<BR>- Added ability to separately specify the field separator string for input 
		  vs output.  Original Sprite supported this, but I always set them to be 
		  the same.  By default they still are.  This became useful to me when 
		  testing XML because I could specify the output field separator as 'XML' 
		  and the input one as whatever my existing table was, read it in and 
		  write it right back out as XML!  The new options are:  sprite_read, 
		  sprite_write, and sprite_field.  The latter sets both to the same thing.
		  sprite_record sets the record separator.
	<LI>0.35  Thu May 30
		<BR>- Made global variable "CBC" an object variable fixing bug which caused 
	  	  problems when one used both an encrypted database and an unencrypted one 
	  	  in the same program (caught by me).  
		<BR>- Added base-64 encoding to the new XML stuff and fixed up the encoding so 
		  that binary data should now work properly both in and out.  Encoded 
		  fields now have a 'xml:encoding="base64"' attribute.  Note:  the 
		  "MIME::Base64" module is now a prerequisite if using XML.
		<BR>- Restored the "sprite_sizelimit" attribute (alias for the "sprite_reclimit" 
		  attribute) for backward compatability sake (I once used this in another 
		  program and DBD::LDAP uses "ldap_sizelimit" - I can't remember why).
	<LI>0.36  Thu Jun 6
		<BR>- Removed -402 warning if SELECT finds no records so Sprite will work like 
		  other DBI databases.  To test if SELECT returned records or not, test the 
		  return value of $sth->execute().  It will be the number of records 
		  returned or "0E0" if none, or undef if error!
		<BR>- Initialize "LongReadLen" attribute because regular DBI returns a default 
		  value of 80, but DBI::PurePerl returns undef (caused Perl warning in test).
		<BR>- Dropping table now returns "0E0" on success instead of 1 (as DBD::Oracle 
		  does).
	<LI>0.37  Tue Jun 11
		<BR>- Fixed bug which prevented Sprite from loading tables with zero or one 
		  records.
		<BR>- Added new option:  "sprite_xsl" to allow one to specify an xsl template 
	 	  url to be written into the xml document containing each table.  Default 
	 	  is none.  Only applies when using the "xml" option!
	<LI>0.38  Never released.
		<BR>- Added "rows" attribute to "select" tag in XML-formatted tables.
	<LI>0.39  Mon Jun 24
		<BR>- Added "rows" attribute to "select" tag in XML-formatted tables.
		<BR>- Added option "sprite_CaseFieldNames".  Default is zero.  If set, causes 
		  field names to be case-sensitive, allowing same table to have multiple 
		  fields with same name and different cases, ie. "field1", and "FIELD1". 
		  Traditional behavior was to convert all field names to upper-case as 
		  does Oracle(tm).  This is similar to the "sprite_CaseTableNames" option 
		  for table names.
	<LI>0.40	 Tue Jul 9
		<BR>- Fixed restriction which prevented one from sorting on fields not in the 
		  selected result-set.
		<BR>- Added multiple ascending/descending selection to the sort "order by" 
		  clause.  Previously, one could only specify ascending/descending once 
		  after the last field and all sorts would be in that direction.  Now, one 
		  can use things like:  "order by field1 desc, field2 asc, field3 desc"
		  Please note that previous queries like "order by field1, field2 desc" 
		  WERE broken since both would sort in descending order!  Now it works like 
		  Oracle where field1 will sort ascending and within that, field2 sorts 
		  descending.
	<LI>0.41	Fri Aug 16
		<BR>- Fixed bug resulting from a missing "require" stmt that returned error 
		  when unencoding base64-encoded values in XML tables.
	<LI>0.42  Thu Sep 5
		<BR>- Added support for DBIx::GeneratedKey.  This ment adding code to save the 
		  current value of the last sequence or "AUTONUMBER" field incremented.  
		  The former are incremented by a call to "sequencename".NEXTVAL in a query, 
		  the latter are incremented by inserting NULL into a "AUTONUMBER" field 
		  in an "INSERT" query.
	<LI>0.43	 Thu Oct 24
		<BR>- Fixed problem with error-handling with DBI when DBI->connect() fails.
		  Sprite now calls "warn" if "PrintError" is in effect and returns error 
		  code and string separated by a colon in "$_", if DBI->connect() fails. 
		  This is due to DBI::set_err() failing when no DBI handle yet created. 
		<BR>- Fixed "create table" to now actually create an XML table when in an XML 
		  database (previously new tables were always created in text format by 
		  very old code that predated the XML option.  It now calls "write_file()" 
		  via "commit()" as it should and as "alter table" does.  Thanks to 
		  Roland Bauer for catching this embarrassing omission.  I guess I had 
		  never actually created a "new" XML table, I had just used "sprite_write" 
		  and sql.pl to change my existing text tables to the new XML format.
		<BR>- Added code to "drop()" (drop table) function to make sure no dangling 
	  	  data is left in memory from the dropped table.
	<LI>0.44	 Tue Feb 11
		<BR>- Fixed 2 bugs related to the "sprite_CaseFieldNames" option.  First, the 
		  option did not work with the "xml" option.  Second, the option precedence 
		  was wrong -- Options specified in the connect() method should override 
		  any in the database (.sdb) file.  This was not happening.
	<LI>0.45  Fri Jun 27
		<BR>- Fixed Makefile.PL bug in Perl 5.8+ where make would fail with something 
		  like "Can't use string ("*.xsi") as a HASH ref...".  Thanks to everyone 
		  who reported this.
	<LI>0.46  Mon Sep 29
		<BR>- Fixed problem with Windows path separators (changed \\ to / for ActivePerl.  
		<BR>- Added Oracle "Truncate" function.
	<LI>0.47  Fri Nov 28 2003
		<BR>- Fixed "_set_fbav"-reported error when sorting field containing a "null" 
		  element.
	<LI>0.50  Fri Mar 5
		<BR>- *JOINS ARE FINALY HERE!*  One can now do very basic two-table inner 
		  equi-joins using Sprite.  This is based on the pre-Oracle-9 syntax, 
		  which supports table name aliasing.  The table-name or alias must be 
		  specified qualifying each fieldname (tablename.fieldname).  See the 
		  docs for an example.  Test & enjoy! ;)
		<BR>- Fixed small bug that prevented passing bind-arguments containing an 
		  escaped single-quote to a "like" expression in a where-clause.
	<LI>0.51  Thu Apr 22
		<BR>- Added new DBI function "last_insert_id" to return the value of the last 
		  sequence number used.  Refer to the DBI docs for arguments and how to 
		  use this function.  The general format is:
		  $number = $dB->func(undef, undef, 'tablename', 'fieldname', 'last_insert_id')
		<BR>- Added new option "sprite_nocase" to support case-insensitive 
		  where-clauses like LDAP.  NOTE - only currently for "LIKE/NOT LIKE".  If 
		  set to a true value, then case is ignored for expressions like:  
		  "where FIELD like 'abc%'".  Default is false.
		<BR>- Fixed bug which prevented the argument to a "like" expression from working 
		  if it contained an escaped single-quote.
	<LI>0.52	 -not released.
	<LI>0.53  Wed Sep 29
		<BR>- Fixed a bug affecting joins where selects without fields, ie. select from 
		  table.. failed.
		<BR>- Fixed another bug affecting joins when queries failed unless both 
		  CaseTableNames and CaseFieldNames were set if field names were lower-case.
	<LI>0.54  Wed Nov 10
		<BR>- Fixed bug involving misinterpretation of the DBI::set_err() function which 
		  caused a null warning to sometimes be issued by perfectly successfull 
		  "Prepare" statements.  Changed the 2nd argument to DBI::set_err() from 
		  zero to undef when clearing error status.  Caught by Steven Bray and me.
		<BR>- Changed all (misspelled) references to the Oracle-ish function "CURVAL"
		  to "CURRVAL".  Caught by Steven Bray.
		<BR>- Fixed variable declaration buglet which "masked earlier declaration".
		  Caught by Steven Bray.  Thanks, Steven.
	<LI>0.55	 Fri Apr 29 2005
		<BR>- Fixed bug that caused single-quotes enclosed in variables bound to 
		  placeholders to fail and or seg-fault.
		<BR>- Fixed bug that caused single-quotes in in-line where-cluse values 
		  (those not bound using placeholders) to be converted to a pair of 
		  double-quotes, causing condition test to fail.
	<LI>0.56  Sat May 14 2005
		<BR>- Fixed bug that prevented sorting from working and returning all records 
		  when doing a SELECT DISTINCT with ORDER BY on a single column.
	<LI>0.57  Tue Jun 14 2006
		<BR>- Fixed bug involving reversal of the increment and start values of 
		  sequences in the "Create Sequence" command.  Should work now, even 
		  though the variable names appear reverse in "NEXTVAL" code.
		<BR>- Added code to support DBI's "primary_key_info" query.
	<LI>0.58  Thu Jul 20 2006
		<BR>- Fixed bug that prevented empty-strings (two quotes in succession) as 
		  arguments to functions (caught by me).
		<BR>- Fixed bug that had sequence values and increments reversed.
		<BR>- Added "primary_key_info()" DBI function.
	<LI>0.59  Sat Oct 21 2006
		<BR>- Fixed bug that prevented last_insert_id() from working with AUTONUMBER 
		  fields.
		<BR>- Added MySQL-like "select fn()" capability.  Previously, one had to use 
		  the Oracle-ish "select fn() from DUAL".
		<BR>- Fixed CaseTableNames bug.
		<BR>- Fixex problem that caused warning message when doing a $dB->disconnect() 
		  when using AutoCommit.
		<BR>- Added several numeric datatype names and mapped them to the existing 
		  numeric types.
		<BR>- Added 2 MySQL-ish functions:  CURDATE, NOW (and now).
	<LI>0.60  Mon Jan 11 2015
		<BR>- Fixed bug that prevented "sprite_nocase" from working properly in some 
		  cases.  Also added "o" switch to numerous unchanging regices for 
		  optimization.
	<LI>6.01  Sat Jan 15 2016
		<BR>- Fixed dropping of trailing zeroes in decimal places of scaled numbers,
		  Changed version number to 6.01 to sync up w/version# in JSprite.pm
		<BR>Added support for the "LIMIT" clause in SELECT statements.  This differs 
		  from "sprite_reclimit" option.  That option limited the fetch to the 
		  first N records in the file UNSORTED before applying any sort.  This 
		  was added to speed up queries used only to fetch column data 
		  descriptors, ie. TYPE, PRECISION, etc. without need to read and process 
		  the entire table.  This new "LIMIT" option limits the RESULTS RETURNED 
		  to N records AFTER sorting and works as it would in other databases.  
		  For compatibility, this can also be specified in the options hash in 
		  PREPARE statements as "sprite_actlimit" ("actual limit").

    *       The module is using flock() internally. However, this function is
            not available on platforms. Using flock() is disabled on MacOS
            and Windows 95: There's no locking at all (perhaps not so
            important on these operating systems, as they are for single
            users anyways).

    *       Unique-key violations on updates probably will not be caught 
            if the argument is a function-call or a field-name.

    *       Sorting for joins:  In order to obtain correct sorting, all 
            fields specifying desired sort order must be grouped together by 
            table, ie. "order by t1.field1, t1.field2, t2.field1, t2.field2", 
            which should work fine.  This is due to the fact that the records 
            are merged together after data for each table is sorted 
            independently.  This should not be an issue for 95+% of all sorts,  
            If it is, patches are welcome and my very own "sort_elements()" 
            module is available to you!  An example of a sort known NOT to 
            work exactly right would be:  
            "order by t1.field1, t2.field1, t1.field2".
