NAME

    Devel::PatchPerl - Patch perl source a la Devel::PPPort's buildperl.pl

VERSION

    version 2.08

SYNOPSIS

      use strict;
      use warnings;
    
      use Devel::PatchPerl;
    
      Devel::PatchPerl->patch_source( '5.6.1', '/path/to/untarred/perl/source/perl-5.6.1' );

DESCRIPTION

    Devel::PatchPerl is a modularisation of the patching code contained in
    Devel::PPPort's buildperl.pl.

    It does not build perls, it merely provides an interface to the source
    patching functionality.

FUNCTION

    patch_source

      Takes two parameters, a perl version and the path to unwrapped perl
      source for that version. It dies on any errors.

      If you don't supply a perl version, it will attempt to auto-determine
      the perl version from the specified path.

      If you don't supply the path to unwrapped perl source, it will assume
      the current working directory.

    determine_version

      Takes one optional parameter, the path to unwrapped perl source. It
      returns the perl version of the source code at the given location. It
      returns undef on error.

      If you don't supply the path to unwrapped perl source, it will assume
      the current working directory.

PLUGIN SYSTEM

    See Devel::PatchPerl::Plugin for details of Devel::PatchPerl's plugin
    system.

PATCHLEVEL

    Devel::PatchPerl will normally update the patchlevel.h file in the perl
    source tree to indicate that it has applied local patches. This
    behaviour is negated if it is detected that it is operating in a git
    repository. To override this and update patchlevel.h when in a Git
    repository, set the env var PERL5_PATCHPERL_PATCHLEVEL to a true value.

    Alternatively, call patchperl with the --patchlevel option.

CAVEAT

    Devel::PatchPerl is intended only to facilitate the building of perls,
    not to facilitate the testing of perls. This means that it will not
    patch failing tests in the perl testsuite.
