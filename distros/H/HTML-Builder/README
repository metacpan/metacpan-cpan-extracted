NAME
    HTML::Builder - A declarative approach to HTML generation

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.008 of HTML::Builder - released
    December 02, 2012 as part of HTML-Builder.

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::Builder ':minimal';

        # $html is: <div id="main"><p>Something, huh?</p></div>
        my $html = div { id gets 'main'; p { 'Something, huh?' } };

DESCRIPTION
    A quick and dirty set of helper functions to make generating small bits
    of HTML a little less tedious.

FUNCTIONS
  our_tags
    A unique, sorted list of the HTML tags we know about (and handle).

  tag($tag_name, $code_ref)
    The actual function responsible for handling the tagging. All of the
    helper functions pass off to tag() (e.g. "div()" is "sub div(&) {
    unshift 'div'; goto \&tag }").

  html5_tags()
    The list of tags we think are HTML5.

  html_tags()
    The list of tags we think are HTML ( < HTML5, that is).

  deprecated_tags()
    HTML elements considered to be deprecated.

  our_tags()
    The unique, sorted list of all tags returned by html5_tags() and
    html_tags().

  html5_minimal_tags()
    A minimal subset of HTML5 tags as returned by html5_tags():

        article aside footer header nav

  conflicting_tags
    Returns a HashRef of tags that conflict with Perl builtins: our named
    exports for the tags are the keys; the tags themselves are the values.

  form_tags
    A list of tags related to forms, that will belong to the ":form" group.

  table_tags
    A list of tags related to tables, that will belong to the ":table"
    group.

  minimal_tags
    A list of tags we consider a "minimal" set. These will belong to the
    ":minimal" group.

  our_tags
    The set of all the tags we know of.

  attr(&)
    An alternative to using "gets" (or instances where it won't work, e.g.
    "for gets 'name'"). Takes a coderef, expects that coderef to return a
    list of attribute => value pairs, e.g.

        div {
            attr {
                id  => 'one',
                bip => 'two',
            };
        };

USAGE
    Each supported HTML tag takes a coderef, executes it, and returns the
    output the coderef writes to STDOUT with the return value appended.

    That is:

        div { say h1 { 'Hi there! }; p { "Nice day, isn't it?" } }

    Generates:

        <div><h1>Hi there!</h1><p>Nice day, isn't it?</p></div>

    Element attributes are handled by specifying them with "gets". e.g.:

        div { id gets 'main'; 'Hi!' }

    Generates:

        <div id="main">Hi!</div>

    gets may be specified multiple times, for multiple attributes.

  Nested Tags
    When one tag function is called from within another, the nested tag will
    print its output to STDOUT rather than returning it. That means that
    this:

        div { print h1 { 'Hi there! }; p { "Nice day, isn't it?" } }

    ...and this:

        div { h1 { 'Hi there! }; p { "Nice day, isn't it?" } }

    Behave identically, from the perspective of the caller.

RENAMING EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    This package uses Sub::Exporter, so you can take advantage of the
    features that package provides. For example, if you wanted to import the
    tags in the 'minimal' group, but wanted to prefix each function with
    'html_', you could do:

        use HTML::Builder -minimal => { -prefix => 'html_' };

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    Each tag we handle is capable of being exported, and called with a
    coderef. This coderef is executed, and the return is wrapped in the tag.
    Attributes on the tag can be set from within the coderef by using gets,
    a la "id gets 'foo'".

    By default we export the ":minimal" group.

  Export Groups
   :all
    Everything not conflicting with Perl builtins.

    This isn't an optimal group to use as-is -- it will cause a ton of
    functions to be imported, including some that will conflict with several
    Perl builtins. If you use this group, you are highly encouraged to
    supply a prefix for it, like:

        use HTML::Builder -all => { -prefix => 'html_' };

   :minimal
    A basic set of the most commonly used tags:

        h1..h4 div p img span script br ul ol li style a

   :html5
    HTML5 tags ("article", "header", "nav", etc) -- or at least what
    Wikipedia thinks are HTML5 tags.

   :table
    The table tags:

        table thead tbody tfoot tr th td

    As "tr" would conflict with a Perl builtin, it is recommended that this
    group be imported with a prefix ('table_' would seem to suggest itself).

   :header
    Header tags:

        header hgroup

   :form
    Form tags:

        form fieldset button input label optgroup option select textarea

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
    This package was inspired by Template::Declare::Tags... In particular,
    our "gets::AUTOLOAD" is pretty much a straight-up copy of
    Template::Declare::Tags' "is::AUTOLOAD", with some modifications. We
    also pass off to HTML::Tiny, and allow it to do the work of actually
    generating the output. Thanks! :)
