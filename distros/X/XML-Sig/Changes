Version 0.33

This release is mostly clean up but does inclued one important fix.

Commit 885ca9f65031dba617aac061370c8def6a3b70b8 introduced a bug related to verifying
signed XML that include a Signature that is unassociated with any nodes in the XML.
The XML::Sig will ignore that unassociated signature and verify all other signatures.
In the event that there are no other signatures the previous version would incorrectly
consider the XML Signatures valid.  This would only occur with a single unassociated
Signature.

Version 0.32

    Release Version of 0.31-TRIAL
    Updates to Changes and verion number

Version 0.31-TRIAL

This release fixes a number of issues.  The biggest changes are related to
signing and verifying with DSA key.  Previously DSA signing and verifying
worked previously only with XML::Sig signed xml and verfication only worked
with XML::Sig.  Now it is able to sign and verify xml interchangably with
xmlsec1 and others.

In addition, in signing xml XML::Sig now looks at the SignedInfo for the
CanonicalMethod to ensure that it matches.
