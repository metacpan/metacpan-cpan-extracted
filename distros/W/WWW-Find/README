       WWW::Find - Web Resource Finder

SYNOPSIS
       use LWP::UserAgent;
       use HTTP::Request;
       use WWW::Find;

       $agent = LWP::UserAgent->new;

       $request = HTTP::Request->new(GET => 'http://begin.url');

       $find = WWW::Find->new(AGENT => $agent,
                              REQUEST => $request,
                              MAX_DEPTH => 2,
                              MATCH_SUB => \&match,
                              FOLLOW_SUB => \&follow
                             );

       $find->go;

DESCRIPTION
       WWW::Find is a Perl module that simplifies the task of searching the 
       web for specific types of information. The inspiration for this project 
       came from the recursive website mirroring program, w3mir.  WWW::Find 
       is similar to w3mir, but with a more general feature set.
                                                                               
       In a nutshell, a WWW::Find object extracts all the HREF links from an
       HTML document, creates a HTTP::Request object for each link, matches
       the HTTP::Response object against user specified criteria, and then
       does something with the matching links (possibly performing the entire
       operation all over again on certain links).  Be careful not to set the
       MAX_DEPTH parameter too high, otherwise you could easily begin the end-
       less task of requesting every page on the net!
                                                                               
       In addition to a LPW::UserAgent and a HTTP::Request object, you'll need
       to create two subroutines: a &match subroutine and a &follow subrou-
       tine.  

       The &follow subroutine should attempt to match the HTTP::Response
       object against user defined criteria.  If a match is found, the entire
       operation is performed all over again on the matching link.  For exam-
       ple, the following subroutine matches all links where the header con-
       tent-type matches the regular expression /text/.
                                                                               
       sub follow {
           my $find_obj = shift;
           my $header = HTTP::Request->new(HEAD => $find_obj->{REQUEST}->uri);
           my $response = $find_obj->{AGENT}->request($header) || next;
           $response->content_type =~ /text/io
           ? return 1
           : return 0;
       }

       The &match subroutine should perform some action on links matching user 
       defined criteria.  For example, the following subroutine simply prints
       out the URL of all links matching the regular expression /html?$/
                                                                               
       sub match {
           my $find_obj = shift;
           if($find_obj->{REQUEST}->uri =~ /html?$/io) {
               print $find_obj->{REQUEST}->uri . "\n";
           }
           return;
       }
