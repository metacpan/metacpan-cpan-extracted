=head2 Introduction

PerlPoint is a simple text format which allows easy typing of text
with headlines, bullet lists, normal text paragraphs, indented
paragraphs for code examples etc., from which slides for presentations
can be generated by a script without the need of proprietary software.
Since there is a large variety of platforms which provide web browsers,
HTML is a good choice for the output format. In principle, however, it
is possible to generate each output format whose specification is
known. At the moment there exist converters for HTML, LaTeX (alpha software)
and SDF. The latter both may be used to generate printable output or to
provide the basis for further processing.


=head2 About PerlPoint-Converters

This package provides two programs:

  pp2html
  pp2latex (still alpha software)

They convert an ASCII file written in the `PerlPoint' language to a set
of HTML files or to Latex Files respectively. The `PerlPoint' language
was initially invented by Tom Christiansen as a simple means for
preparing slides. The idea was to just write down your headings and
bullet items and then use a simple perl script to create the slides:

  =Header of first slide

  * Use your favourite editor

  * Start headings with a `='

  * Bullets items start with an asterisk `*'

The syntax of the original version was similar to POD and the layout 
of the slides was hard coded in Tom's pp2html script. The new syntax 
provides more felxibility and can be parsed with the PerlPoint::Parser 
from Jochen Stenzel's PerlPoint-Package.

The following list persents some of the features of pp2html and pp2latex:

  - HTML template files for header, footer and navigation bar
  - Support of Frame Sets
  - Support of the TreeControl Applet in tabel of contents
  - Headers with different levels with or wihout numbering
    (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, ...)
  - Hyperlinks to internal and external pages
  - Automatic generation of table of contents and navigation links
  - Automatic generation of index
  - Bullet-Lists with standard <LI> bullets or with bullets from 
    a gif/jpeg file
  - Numbered lists and definition lists
  - Simple tables
  - Simple text formatting possible

For more information about the PerlPoint syntax and history please
refer to the documentation in the PerlPoint-Package from Jochen Stenzel
(perldoc PerlPoint::Parser) and to the provided documentation in the
./doc/PPDOC subdirectory (after a successful "make" in ./doc :-)


=head2 Prerequisits

This version needs Perl5.005.

The pp2html program uses the following packages which are available on CPAN
or come with your Perl distribution:

  Pod::Text
  Getopt::Long
  Getopt::ArgvFile
  PerlPoint::Parser
  PerlPoint::Backend
  PerlPoint::Constants
  PerlPoint::Tags::Basic;
  PerlPoint::Tags::HTML;  (part of PerlPoint-Converters)
  PerlPoint::Tags::LaTeX; (part of PerlPoint-Converters)

The TreeApplet classes are contained in the pp2html_stypes subdirectory of this
distribution. For more information about the TreeApplet classes refer to
http://www.naturallyj.com.
This distribution contains an older version which was freely available.


=head2 What's new in this version

This is version 1.00.
You will need PerlPoint-Packet version 0.36 for this release.

Please refer to file "Changes".

=over 4

=item NOTE:

Documentation is not yet perfect, but hopefully better than before.
Please try a "make" in ./doc and look at the documents which
should have been created in ./doc/PPDOC

=back

=head2 Installation

Just get the PerlPoint-Converters-<release>.tar.gz file and unpack it in a temp directory:

  % tar zxvf PerlPoint-Converters-<release>.tar.gz 
  % cd PerlPoint-Converters-<release>
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

  % cd ./doc
  % make

The main program is `pp2html'. Try `pp2html --help | less' to get more 
information.

=head2 Documentation

C<pp2hml> and C<pp2latex> have a --help option which displays
Usage information and some documentation about the PerlPoint
Language. For a more detailed description please refer to the
POD documentation of the following Modules:

 PerlPoint::Parser
 PerlPoint::Anchors
 PerlPoint::Backend
 PerlPoint::Constants
 PerlPoint::Tags
 PerlPoint::Tags::Basic
 PerlPoint::Tags::CPPP
 PerlPoint::Tags::HTML
 PerlPoint::Tags::LaTeX
 PerlPoint::Tags::SDF

Have also a look into the ./doc directory of your PerlPoint::Converters
installation directory. There is a Makefile which produces the
following PerlPoint documents:

with the documentation in the ./doc subdirectory.


=head2 Bug Reports and Support

Please send bug reports and requests to <lorenz.domke@gmx.de>

=head2 Credits

Thanks to Tom Christiansen for the idea and first implementation
of PerlPoint! And special thanks for his permission to use this
name for our new implementation.

Thanks to Jochen Stenzel who tested the first versions of pp2html
and supplied the powerful PerlPoint-Package which is the base of
this new implementation of pp2html.

Thanks to Stephen Riehm who shared his ideas of extensions for
the original software with us. The final language was basically
designed by a team of Jochen, him and me.

Thanks to Alex Sigel and Norbert Gruener who became our first
testers outside the team and helped us by their usage reports.
Special thanks to Alex for propagating the toolkit and his help
to publish the software!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PerlPoint::Converters qw(
                               replace_keywords
                               update_file
                               copy_file
                             );

 copy_file($from, $to);

 update_file($from, $to);

 $line = replace_keywords($line, $KEY_HASH_REF);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains some common functions which are
useful for most PerlPoint converters.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=cut

sub replace_keywords { #{{{-----------------------------------------

=head2 replace_keywords($line, $KEY_HASH_REF);

Replace all occurences of certain keywords in $line with the
values specified in the referenced hash.
The keys in the hash must be lower case keywords.

Example:

 %OPT = (
    title        => "PerlPoint Examples",
    bot_left_txt => "Copyright A. User",
 );

 open(TPL, "a_template_file");
 while(<TPL>){
   print replace_keywords($_, \%OPT);
 }

This will replace "TITLE" with "PerlPoint Examples" and "BOT_LEFT_TXT"
with "Copyright A. User".

The supported keywords are:

  TXT_CONTENTS
  TXT_INDEX

sub copy_file { #{{{ -----------------------------------------------

=head2 copy_file($from, $to, $verbose, $KEY_HASH_REF);

Copy file C<$from> to file C<$to>. For binary files (! -T) the File::Copy
method will be used. Text files are copied by reading from
C<$from> and printing to C<$to>. All lines are
treated with the C<replace_keywords> method.

Prints a message to STDERR if $verbose is set to 1.

  }
} # copy_file }}}

sub update_file { #{{{ ---------------------------------------------

=head2 update_file($from, $to, $verbose, $KEY_HASH_REF, $moveFlag);

Update file C<$from> to file C<$to> if necessary. For binary files (! -T)
the File::Copy method will be used. Files are only copied if the
modification date of C<$to> is older than the modification date of C<$from>.

Text files are B<always> copied by reading from
C<$from> and printing to C<$to> because keywords might have
changed. All lines are treated with the C<replace_keywords> method.

Prints a message to STDERR if $verbose is set to 1.

The source file is removed if the $moveFlag was set to a true value,
which means that the function performs a move instead of a copy.

sub return_abs_path { #{{{ -----------------------------------------

current working directory.
