        getAllResponseHeaders now returns the headers with CR LF line
        endings instead of just LF.

0.08    15 August, 2010
        file:  URLs now work when they contain  %-escapes  beyond the
        ASCII range.

      • send()  now sets the Content-Length header for a POST request.
        Thanks to Erwan Mas for fixing this.
      • send(data)  now actually sends the data when the Content-Type
        has been set explicitly with an encoding. Thanks to Erwan Mas
        for finding this.

0.06    7 March, 2010
      • perl 5.8.4 and lower are no longer supported.
      • t/http.t  is now skipped on Windows,  which does not  support
        open FH, '-|', LIST.
      • LWP errors are now also turned into  NETWORK_ERRs,  just like
        infinite redirects.
      • Encoding detection now uses  HTTP::Message’s  content_charset
        feature (which correctly detects XML and HTML encoding),  and
        resorts to BOM-sniffing if the former doesn’t  work,  instead
        of relying solely on the Content-Type header.
      • Invalid byte sequences are now turned into single  (not multi-
        ple) U+FFFD characters during decoding.
      • The  open  method now dies if the name  argument  contains  a
        colon.  (Before, it would record the name and the send method
        would die instead.)
      • Names and passwords are now sent in UTF-8 encoding. They used
        to be sent in Latin 1,  except for those with  chars  outside
        its range, which would cause errors instead.
      • The body of a request is now encoded in UTF-8 if it  is  text,
        or in whatever encoding  is  specified  via  setRequestHeader.
      • Document objects passed to send() are now serialised properly,
        instead of simply being converted to strings.
      • send now returns nothing, the way it’s supposed to.  It  used
        to return true for successful HTTP status codes.
      • onreadystatechange  is no longer triggered multiple times  by
        send() for synchronous requests.
      • The  abort  method now actually aborts  when  called  from  a
        readystatechange handler.
      • The abort method now switches the state to DONE and calls the
        readystatechange handlers before aborting if the send  method
        is active.

0.05    8 November, 2009
        Fixed to work with LWP 5.833

0.04    4 October, 2009
        Fixed a really nasty bug:  Sending any data  via  the  send()
        method via  HTTP  would tickle an incompatibility  with  LWP/
        Protocol/http.pm  that would result in an  LWP-generated  500
        error (Not a SCALAR reference). (We now stringify the content
        before passing it to LWP.) Thanks to Steven Nikkel for report-
        ing the error.

0.03    30 September, 2009
      • Infinite or external redirects are  now  turned  into  errors
        (NETWORK_ERRs) if async is false. In any case, they now cause
        all information pertaining to the response  to  be  discarded.
      • getResponseHeader and  getAllResponseHeaders  now produce the
        correct type of error  (INVALID_STATE_ERR)  when the state is
        UNSENT or OPENED.
      • As a temporary hack to get someone’s code working,  this  mod-
        ule adds textContent to XML::DOM::Lite::Node,  if it does not
        already exist.

0.02    15 August, 2009
        Fixed to work  with  WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript  0.002.
        The test script was relying on a bug in that module.

0.01    5 April, 2009
        First version. Just a renamed version of the Mech plugin with
        a few tweaks.


Revision history for WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Ajax

0.05    16 October, 2008
        Fixed to work with  LWP  5.818,  which has a heart attack when
        an HTTP header’s value is an object that happens indirectly to
        reference a code reference.

0.04    15 October, 2008
        No new features; simply updated to work with LWP 5.815

0.03    9 September, 2008
        • The errors produced when the URL passed to open is from the
          wrong site/port/etc. are now DOMException objects.
        • The open method now clears the responseText and the
          request headers.
        • The send method now raises a readystatechange event on send-
          ing (without changing the readyState)  and for the ‘loading’
          state (3).
        • The setRequestHeader method now dies when called at a time
          other than between open and send.
        • setRequestHeader now throws a syntax error when the argu-
          ments do not conform to HTTP syntax.
        • The send method no longer runs scripts on HTML pages that
          it fetches.
        • setRequestHeader now ignores certain HTTP headers for the
          sake of security and HTTP compliancy.
        • The send method now dies when the readyState is not OPENED
          or when it is called recursively.
        • Assigning null to onreadystatechange no longer causes warn-
          ings and errors during event dispatch.
        • The argument to the send method is now ignored for GET and
          HEAD requests.

0.02    19 August, 2008
        • Relative URIs are now supported.
        • URIs are now checked to see whether they originate from the
          same server  (and port and  scheme)  as  the  current  page.
        • Fake cookies (created by setRequestHeader) are no longer
          clobbered when there are real cookies.
        • The event methods addEventListener, removeEventListener and
          dispatchEvent have been added.
        • There are now constants for the readyState
          (XMLHttpRequest.UNSENT etc.).
        • Non-standard HTTP method names are no longer folded to
          uppercase.
        • The ‘open’ method now dies if the method name is not a
          valid HTTP token or if it is CONNECT,  TRACE or  TRACK
          (case-tolerant).
        • The fragment part (#...) of a URI is now stripped.
        • The ‘open’ method now dies if the URL’s scheme is not
          supported.
        • Username and password are now gleaned from the URL if pres-
          ent and if the corresponding  args  to  open  are  omitted.
        • The username and password info no  longer  leaks  from  one
          object to the next. (The send method used to set the creden-
          tials for all XHR objects that didn’t have any.)
