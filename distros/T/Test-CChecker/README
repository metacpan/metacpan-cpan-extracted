NAME

    Test::CChecker - Test-time utilities for checking C headers, libraries,
    or OS features (DEPRECATED)

VERSION

    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::Foo;
     use Test::CChecker;
     
     compile_with_alien 'Alien::Foo';
     
     compile_run_ok <<C_CODE, "basic compile test";
     int
     main(int argc, char *argv[])
     {
       return 0;
     }
     C_CODE

DESCRIPTION

    DEPRECATED: The intention of this module was always to test Alien
    modules (both Alien::Base based and non-Alien::Base based modules). It
    has a number of shortcomings that I believe to be better addressed by
    Test::Alien, so please consider using that for new projects, or even
    migrating existing code.

    This module is a very thin convenience wrapper around
    ExtUtils::CChecker to make it useful for use in a test context. It is
    intended for use with Alien modules which need to verify that libraries
    work as intended with the Compiler and flags used by Perl to build XS
    modules.

    By default this module is very quiet, hiding all output using
    Capture::Tiny unless there is a failure, in which case you will see the
    commands, flags and output used.

FUNCTIONS

    All documented functions are exported into your test's namespace

 cc

     my $cc = cc;

    Returns the ExtUtils::CChecker object used for testing.

    This is mainly useful for adding compiler or linker flags:

     cc->push_extra_compiler_flags('-DFOO=1');
     cc->push_extra_linker_flags('-L/foo/bar/baz', '-lfoo')

 compile_run_ok

     compile_run_ok $c_source, $message;
    
     compile_run_ok {
       source => $c_source,
       extra_compiler_flags => \@cflags,
       extra_linker_flags => \@libs,
     }, $message;

    This test attempts to compile the given c_source and passes if it runs
    with return value of zero. The first argument can be either a string
    containing the C source code, or a hashref (which will be passed
    unmodified as a hash to ExtUtils::CChecker try_compile_run).

    If the test fails, then the complete output will be reported using
    Test::More diag.

    You can have it report the output on success with
    "compile_output_to_diag" or "compile_output_to_note".

    In addition to the pass/fail and diagnostic output, this function will
    return true or false on success and failure respectively.

 compile_ok

     compile_ok $c_source, $message;
    
     compile_ok {
       source => $c_source,
       extra_compiler_flags => \@cflags,
     }, $message;

    This is like "compile_run_ok", except it stops after compiling and does
    not attempt to link or run.

 compile_with_alien

     use Alien::Foo;
     compile_with_alien 'Alien::Foo';

    Specifies an Alien module to use to get compiler flags and libraries.
    You may pass in either the name of the class (it must already be
    loaded), or an instance of that class. The instance of the Alien class
    is expected to implement cflags and libs methods that return the
    compiler and library flags respectively.

    If you are testing an Alien module after it has been built, but before
    it has been installed (for example if you are writing the test suite
    FOR the Alien module itself), you need to install to a temporary
    directory named _test. If you are using Alien::Base, the easiest way to
    do this is to add a make install with DISTDIR set to _test:

     Alien::Base::Module::Build->new(
       ...
       "alien_build_commands" => [
         "%pconfigure --prefix=%s",
         "make",
         "make DESTDIR=`pwd`/../../_test install",
       ],
       ...
     )->create_build_script;

    or if you are using Dist::Zilla, something like this:

     [Alien]
     build_command = %pconfigure --prefix=%s --disable-bsdtar --disable-bsdcpio
     build_command = make
     build_command = make DESTDIR=`pwd`/../../_test install

 compile_output_to_nowhere

     compile_output_to_nowhere

    Do not report output unless there is a failure. This is the default
    behavior.

 compile_output_to_diag

     compile_output_to_diag;

    Report output using Test::More diag on success (output is always
    reported on failure using daig).

 compile_output_to_note

     compile_output_to_note;

    Report output using Test::More note on success (output is always
    reported on failure using diag).
