NAME
    Perl6::Doc - Perl 6 documentation

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution is documentation-only. It contains no code for you to
    run. Included are various Perl 5 Pod and Perl 6 Pod files describing the
    Perl 6 language. For a tool to read this documentation, see grok.

DESCRIPTION
    Currently included in this distribution:

  Design docs
   Apocalypses (outdated)
    Larry Wall started the Apocalypse (latin for revelation) series as a
    systematic way of answering the RFCs (Request For Comments) that started
    the design process for Perl 6. Each Apocalypse corresponds to a chapter
    in the book *Programming Perl, 3rd edition*, and addresses the features
    relating to that chapter in the book that are likely to change.

    Larry addresses each relevant RFC, and gives reasons why he accepted or
    rejected various pieces of it. But each Apocalypse also goes beyond a
    simple "yes" and "no" response to attack the roots of the problems
    identified in the RFCs.

    Note: These documents are outdated and and will not be updated to match
    the specification (see "Synopses").

   Exegeses (outdated)
    Damian Conway's Exegeses (latin for *explanation*) are extensions of
    each Apocalypse. Each Exegesis is built around a practical code example
    that applies and explains the new ideas.

    Note: These documents are outdated and and will not be updated to match
    the specification (see "Synopses").

   Synopses
    The Synopsis (latin for comparison) started as a fast to read diff
    between Perl 5 and 6. Because they are also easier to maintain, all
    changes of the language, that are evolving from the design process are
    written down here first. The Apocalypses and Exegeses are frozen as
    "historic documents".

    In other words, these docs may change slightly or radically. But the
    expectation is that they are "very close" to the final shape of Perl 6.

    The Synopsis documents are to be taken as the formal specification for
    Perl 6 implementations, while still being reference documentation for
    Perl 6, like *Programming Perl* is for Perl 5.

    Note that while these documents still being subjected to the rigours of
    cross-examination through implementation.

  Magazine articles
    These are Pod-ified versions of magazine articles about Perl 6 that have
    appeared in print during the design process. Take these with a grain of
    salt as they might not describe Perl 6 as it is now. They are mostly
    from <http://www.perl.com> and <http://www.perl-magazin.de/>.

  Perl 6 Table Index
    A Pod-ified version of
    <http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_index_tablet> is
    included.

  Man pages
    Currently included are draft versions of perlintro and perlsyn.

HISTORY
    As of version 0.40, this distribution has been overhauled and is no
    longer maintained by Herbert Breunung, who originally took it over from
    ingy and audreyt.
