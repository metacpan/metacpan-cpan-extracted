Revision history for Perl module Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst:

0.60 Fri Dec 26 22:00 GMT 2014
     - Make two test cases compatible with Catalyst 5.90080+ changes
       to encoding (UTF8 because default).
     - Added a new test case that runs only under 5.90080 and makes
       sure that expected UTF8 stuff works.

0.59 Mon Jan 13 11:23 GMT 2014
     - Use Class::Load instead of Class::MOP::load_class(). RT#90978

0.58 Sat Jun 30 17:01 BST 2012
     - Fix external server test.
     - Fix infinite redirects. RT#76614
     - Make fail to start server more verbose. RT#77174

     - Fixed RT 52270

     - Add port to Host header

     - Set 'Host' header for remote requests too

0.54 Mon Aug 1 20:49 BST 2011
     - change to make sure we support changes in Catalyst::Test introduced
       in the Cataplack port.

0.53 Sun Dec 5 23:03 GMT 2010
     - Fix tests to work with the upcoming psgi based Catalyst release
       as $c->req->header('Host') now more accurately reflects what you
       see in a real web server (i.e. the port will not be defined if it
       is 80)
     - Fix tests to work when the CATALYST_DEBUG environment variable is
       set by explicitly setting it to 0 in tests which require it.

0.52 Mon Mar 8 01:25 GMT 2010
     - Move actions out of the test applications to avoid deprecation warnings.
     - POD corrections by jhannah
     - Bump version dependency of Test::WWW::Mechanize to 1.54 to fix RT#44555
     - Wrap checks for the appropriate plugins to skip tests inside a BEGIN
       block so that they are run before the app tries to be loaded at compile
       time, fixing RT#47037

0.51 Mon Mar 16 10:00 GMT 2009
     - Doc updates from thejester
     - User agent fixes from ANDREMAR
     - Fix bug where redirect was followed on a 500 response
     - All remote requests (i.e. CATALYST_SERVER env var) now use our own
       mechanize object, rather than an unconfigurable one from Catalyst:Test

0.50 Tue Feb 17 09:12 GMT 2009
     - Remove warning in HTTP::Cookies
     - Call BUILDALL

0.50_2 Thur Feb 12 09:47 GMT 2009
     - Make t/multi_content_type.t handle case when server cant be started,
       which is almost always due to port in use.

0.50_1 Thur Feb 5 09:02 GMT 2009
     - App classname no longer has to be passed to import:
        $m = T::W::M::C->new(catalyst_app => 'Catty')
       now works.
     - Can now use TWMC two test two different apps in the same perl
       interpreter due to the above change
     - Removed Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst::Aux package as it isn't needed
       any more
