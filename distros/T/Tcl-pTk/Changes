Summary of Changes to Tcl::pTk

Release 0.93:  2018-07-13

 * Add missing module `Sub::Name` to PREREQ_PM (RT #116432)
 * Replace corrupted teapot.ppm, mark as binary (RT #125421)
 * Add focusFollowsMouse support (RT #125057)
 * Adjust scrolling units on macOS aqua (RT #125048)
 * Only use buttons 4 and 5 for scrolling on X11 (i.e. not macOS aqua)
 * Use previously-unused variable $wp in Tcl::pTk::Widget::focusForce
 * Add missing `use Text::Tabs;` to top of Text.pm (RT #125460)
 * Remove "Copied $val\n" print debugging statement (RT #125442)
 * Use empty string instead of `undef` to clear $status_bar
   in menus2.pl demo to prevent warning (RT #125826)
 * Keep textRO.t running if command line arg present (for debugging)
 * Bind mouse buttons 2 and 3 appropriately on macOS aqua
   since they are the opposite of what X11 and Windows use
   (RT #125050, #125460)
 * Use `catch` in test-for-tk.tcl to prevent skipping tests for packages
 * Support newer Perl/Tk FindNext() $direction syntax (RT #125532)
   by adapting the relevant Perl/Tk commit (the existing text2.t was
   renamed to text2-old.t, and the new text2.t was copied)
 * Various spelling and POD formatting fixes

Release 0.92:  2016-08-21

 * Updated to work with Tcl.pm versions > 1.02. Tcl.pm versions > 1.02 broke compatibility
     with Tcl::pTk, so the Tcl 1.02 interface was moved to Tcl/pTk.pm 
 * Added new ttkTixNotebook widget, which emulates the interface of the Tk Notebook widget.
   Updated Facelift.pm to use this new widget, instead of the old tix NoteBook widget.
 * Fix to Wm.pm to handle an rare condition where if Busy is called when a canvas is opened
   in another window, the new window will popup under the existing window, not on top as expected.
 * Fix for a problem with the dialog box widget that would pop up off the screen if running from
   two displays. Added a test case for this condition.
           
Release 0.90:  2015-07-04

 * Updates to work with Tcl/Tk 8.6.
 * Added background error handling (including a ErrorDialog.pm file like perl/tk) that is
   more compatible with the way perl/tk does it.
 * Fixed bug where a repeat call would create a TCL-command in TCL-land for each repeated event. 
   Changed to reuse the Tcl-command. Added test case (repeatSubReuse.t)
           
Release 0.85:  2010-11-05

   when calling entrycget with -image option.

 * Minor updates so the CPAN indexer won't index demo directories.

 * First Public Release.
