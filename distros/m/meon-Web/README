DESCRIPTION
    meon-Web is CMS for designers or publishers that wants to use the whole
    power of HTML for their sites, but doesn't want to bother with
    programming.

    Main implementation goal is be able to have sites as files and go as far
    as possible with standard XML+XSLT without database usage.

    Each web pages is XML files with content part of given page. Then the
    rest of the page (menu + header + footer) are added via XSLT. Any
    advanced dynamically generated content on the page can be easily
    implemented as special tag, which will be rendered via XSLT.

FEATURES
    *   multiple domains/websites at once support - stored simple in
        different folders, switched per request based on "Host:" header.

    *   login + members area - users + credentials are stored in XML files.
        Login restriction simply by adding XML tag to meta headers.

    *   form2email - send form to email address

EXAMPLES

    example.
