NAME

  Lingua::EN::Sentence -  split text into sentences
  
SYNOPSIS

	use Lingua::EN::Sentence qw( get_sentences add_acronyms );

	add_acronyms('lt','gen');		## adding support for 'Lt. Gen.'
	my $sentences=get_sentences($text);	## Get the sentences.
	foreach my $sentence (@$sentences) {
		## do something with $sentence
	}
    
DESCRIPTION

The C<Lingua::EN::Sentence> module contains the function get_sentences, which
splits text into its constituent sentences, based on a regular expression and a
list of abbreviations (built in and given).

Certain well know exceptions, such as abbreviations, may cause incorrect
segmentations. But some of them are already integrated into this code and are
being taken care of. Still, if you see that there are words causing the
get_sentences() to fail, you can add those to the module, so it notices them.
