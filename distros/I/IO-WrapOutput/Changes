Revision history for IO-WrapOutput

    - I wrote 'Win32' instead of 'MSWin32', so tests weren't skipped. Doh.
    - Add some diagnostics to the POE test to troubleshoot a CPAN tester

0.06  Thu Jun 9 13:14:20 GMT 2011
    - Skip tests on Win32 for now, due to a newline/pipe issue (I think)

0.05  Tue Jun 7 00:11:20 GMT 2011
    - Try to work around a potential 3-arg open() issue on Perl 5.6

0.04  Sun Jun 5 22:28:05 GMT 2011
    - Fix Perl 5.6 compatibility
    - Make the POE test a TODO test due to Term::ReadKey issue (#56486)

0.03  Fri Jun 3 04:00:57 GMT 2011
    - Skip POE test when there's no Term::Cap or Term::ReadKey

0.02  Wed May 25 06:16:28 GMT 2011
