This README is specifically for the code in the ExamplesBagging subdirectory of the
installation directory.

See the README in the `Examples' subdirectory of the installation directory for the
main examples for using the DecisionTree module.


(1)   bagging_for_classifying_one_test_sample.pl

      In order to become familiar with how the DecisionTree module can be used with
      bagging, this should be first example you should become familiar with.

      This example uses bagging to classify a single test sample.


(2)   bagging_for_bulk_classification.pl

      If you want to use bagging to classify all of the test samples in a disk file in
      one fell swoop, look carefully at this example.

      An example call for this script:

        bagging_for_bulk_classification.pl  training5.csv  test5.csv   out5.csv


      where all of your training data is in the file training5.csv and all the test
      samples in the file test5.csv.  The calculated class labels for the test samples
      are written out to the file out5.csv
