NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::Plicease - Dist::Zilla plugins used by
    Plicease

VERSION

    version 2.37

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution contains some miscellaneous plugins that I use that
    should probably not be of any use to anyone else. Historically they
    were used and included by my bundle [@Author::Plicease], but I've
    separated them into their own distribution so they can be installed
    without the the full set of prereqs required by the bundle.

METHODS

 dist_dir

     my $dir = Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::Plicease->dist_dir;

    Returns this distributions share directory.
