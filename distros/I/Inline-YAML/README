SYNOPSIS

        title: Fearless Leader
        hacks: [patch, perl]
        ---

        hacks:
          - Inline
          - YAML
          - Inline::YAML
        ...

        foreach (@hackers) {
            my $quote = $_->{name};
            $quote .= ", the $_->{title},"
              if defined $_->{title};
            $quote .= ", aka '$_->{nickname}',"
              if defined $_->{nickname};
            $quote .= ' hacked ';
            $quote .= join(' and ', @{$_->{hacks}});
            $quote .= ".\n";
            print $quote;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    YAML let's you express any Perl data in a very clean and easy to read
    format. Inline::YAML lets you put YAML streams directly into your Perl
    programs without any extra syntax.

    If you need to express a large static data structure in your code, YAML
    is a great way to do it. It has a minimum of control characters and uses
    indentation for structure. You'll need less quotes, less commas and less
    braces.

    The YAML streams should begin with '---' in column 1, and end with '...'
    in column 1, both of which are proper YAML constructs for starting and
    ending a stream. The YAML will return a list equal in length to the
    number of '---' lines.

HOW IT WORKS
    Inline::YAML is a simple filter (using Filter::Simple) that turns:

        my $answers =
        ---
        who: You
        what: Chicken Butt
        where: Under There
        ...

    into:

        my $answers = YAML::Load <<'...';
        ---
        who: You
        what: Chicken Butt
        where: Under There
        ...
