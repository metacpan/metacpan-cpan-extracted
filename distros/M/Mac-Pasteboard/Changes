    Move bin/pbtool to script/pbtool

    Use test compile to find MacTypes.h.  I was previously explicitly
    testing for it in /usr/include/, but apparently it can live
    elsewhere and still be used.

    Eliminate unused variables in pbl.c.

    Ditch 'use base'.

    Impose minimum Perl of 5.6.2.

    Add Makefile targets authortest, testcover.

    Document script editor name change in eg/README.

   Notify users of intent to remove the configuration prompt (about
     installing pbtool) and simply install it by default. The -y and -n
     options will remain, with their present function.

    the required version of Test::More, to 0.96.

  Clean up compile warnings in XS code. The most significant change here
    is a correction in the size of the pasteboard flavor flags, from
    'unsigned long' to 'unsigned int' (or equivalent).
  Add metnods default_flavor() (to override the hard-wired default) and
    encode() (to encode data to and decode data from the UTF flavors).
  Add subtroutines pbflavor(), pbflavor_find(), pbencode(), and
    pbencode_find() to do the same thing for the convenience
    subroutines.
  Support pbflavor() and pbencode() in bin/pbtool.
  Support specifying the output encoding in bin/pbtool.
  Have the pbtool script dump the flavor flags in hex.

  Make Changes file Test::CPAN::Changes compliant. Add author test
    xt/author/changes.t to be sure it stays that way.
  Attempt to address the fact that Mac::Errors is optional, but the
    Cpants Kwalitee Game thinks it is required.

  Document the fact that Mac::Pasteboard does not (yet) support the Mac
    OS 10.6 Snow Leopard functionality of placing more than one item on
    a pasteboard. Also document a workaround if the user is trying to
    write a droplet.
  Skip rather than fail when t/basic.t gets an error that indicates that
    we are forbidden to access the pasteboard. Enhance the skip message
    to include 'ssh session' as a possible reason for this.

  Converted to Perl-Foundation-recommended copyright and license.
