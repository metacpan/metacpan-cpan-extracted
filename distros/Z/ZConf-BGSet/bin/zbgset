=head1 NAME

zbgset - A perl program for managing the background.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

zbgset (B<-f> <file>|B<-r>|B<-l>) [B<-F> <fill type>] [B<-s> <ZConf set>]

=head1 USAGE

Either -f, -r, or -l need used.

This does not actually set the background, but calls another program to do it,
but what makes it useful is it allows for random images to be used as well as
the last image to be called. This makes it useful for setting the image upon
login or changing it regullarly through cron.

When it is ran for the first time it creates a ZConf config named "zbgset" used
store the settings.

=head1 ARGUEMENTS

=head2 B<-f> <file>

This specifies a file to use.

=head2 B<-F> <fill type>

This specifies the fill type to use.

=head2 B<-l>

Use the last image.

=head2 B<-p> <path>

If this is specified, the specified path is used for selecting the random image from.

=head2 B<-s> <ZConf set>

This is the ZConf set to use for it. If the set has not been initiated before it
will do so.


=head1 EXIT CODES

Any codes not listed below reflect the error value of ZConf::BGSet.

=head2 254

No usable options specified.
