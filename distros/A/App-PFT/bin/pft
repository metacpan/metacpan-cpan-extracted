=head1 NAME

pft - Hacker friendly static blog generator

=head1 SYNOPSYS

pft <command> [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<PFT> It is a static website generator written in Perl.  PFT stands for
I<Plain F. Text>, where the meaning of I<F> is up to personal
interpretation. Like I<Fancy> or I<Fantastic>.

Static means that your content is compiled once and the result can be
served by a simple HTTP server, without need of server-side dynamic
content generation. Actually it doesn't need a server either: you can use
it as note-taking application and browse trough your local files.

I<PFT> is designed to be Hacker Friendly: it's a command-line application
with unicode support, which handles your website's boilerplate, but stays
out of the way. It comes with number of subcommands:

=over

=item * B<init>: Initialize a B<pft> site in the current directory;

=item * B<edit>: Create a content text (e.g. page or blog entry);

=item * B<make>: Build the website;

=item * B<pub>: Publish the website;

=item * B<clean>: Clear built tree;

=item * B<grab>: Grab a file as attachment or picture;

=item * B<ls>: List content and properties;

=item * B<show>: Show the compiled site in a web browser;

=item * B<help>: Show this manual.

=back

The manual of each sub-command is available in form of manpages or by
invoking it with the C<--help> flag.

=head1 FILESYSTEM LAYOUT

A new site can be initialized by running the C<pft init> command inside a
directory. In this document such directory will be called I<ROOT>.

The initialization command produces the following filesystem structure:

    ROOT
    ├── pft.yaml            - Configuration file
    ├── content
    │   ├── attachments     - Location for attachments
    │   ├── blog            - Root location for blog entries source files
    │   ├── pages           - Location for pages source files
    │   ├── pics            - Location for pictures lookup
    │   └── tags            - Location for tag pages source files
    ├── build               - Location of the built website
    ├── inject              - Content to bulk inject the online site root
    └── templates           - Location for templates

=head2 C<pft.yaml>: configuration file

The configuration file is created automatically by the C<pft init>
command, and populated with sensible defaults.  It is expected to be in
I<YAML> format. For more information consult the manual of C<pft init>.

=head2 C<content>: files generated by the user

This is where your content is stored. The C<pft edit> and C<pft grab>
commands will add text and binary files respectively in the appropriate
subdirectories. The C<pft make> command will scan the C<content> directory
while building the website.

=head2 C<build>: where the built website is placed

The C<pft make> command will place the HTML pages resulting from the
compilation in this directory. The C<pft pub> command will publish what
here is contained. The C<pft clean> command will erase it.

=head2 C<inject>: a place for auxiliary files

It's common practice to add files in the root directory of your online
website. The C<pft make> command will add any arbitrary file which is
found in the C<inject> directory to the C<build> directory after
compilation.

A good use case for this feature is the C<.htaccess> file used by the
Apache webserver. Another one is the picture you want to share on the fly
with your friend.

=head2 C<templates>: HTML templates for compilation

Each text entry in your C<content> directory will be mapped by C<pft make>
to an HTML file. The output is created by expanding the content into the
structure defined by a template file.

Multiple template files can be stored in the C<template> directory. Some
default files installed by C<pft init>.

Among other things, the C<pft.yaml> configuration defines which default
template page should be used for the site. Single content entries can
override this setting by declaring a different template name in their
header. More details about the header can be found in the C<pft edit>
manual page. Templates are documented in the C<pft make> manual page.
