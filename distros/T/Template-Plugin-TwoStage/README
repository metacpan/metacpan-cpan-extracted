NAME
    Template::Plugin::TwoStage - two stage processing of template blocks
    with first stage caching

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
    This is a plugin for the Template Toolkit that facilitates a two stage
    processing of BLOCKs/templates with first stage caching. Processing
    results of the first (precompilation) stage are cached away for
    subsequent repeated processing in the second (runtime) stage.
    Precompilation and runtime tags are seperated by using different tag
    styles.

    Sample Configuration via TT configuration:

       Template->new( { ..., TwoStage => { caching_dir => My::Application->path_to_tmp(), ... } } );

    Basic usage in the a TT2-template:

       [%   USE TwoStage; 
            TwoStage.process( 
                    template => 'cached_page', 
                    keys => { bar => bar  }, 
                    ttl => 60 * 60 
            );

            BLOCK cached_page; 
                    # use precompile tags or runtime tags here
       %]
                    [* foo # runtime stage evaluation *]    
       [%              IF bar; # precompilation stage evaluation 
                            # ... 
                       ELSE;
                            # ...
                       END;
            END 
       %]

FEATURES
    *   parameterized precompilation of a single block

        Pass keys as additional identifiers of a BLOCK/template, based upon
        which the BLOCK/template produces a different precompiled
        output/version.

    *   expiration

        Give the precompiled BLOCKs/templates a 'time to live' before they
        expire.

    *   namespaces

        Distinguish different e.g. applications sharing a common TwoStage
        plugin (sub)class and/or caching directory by the use of namespaces.

    *   development mode

        Edit your templates with caching turned off. The development mode
        also gives you convenient access to the precompiled versions
        produced for validation of your separation of precompilation and
        runtime directives.

    *   flexible configuration

        Set your basic configuration in the TT configuration, or in a
        subclass of this plugin, and override any configuration option on
        plugin construction or even on single plugin method calls to
        include() or process() in the templates.

USE CASES
    You might benefit from this module if ...

    *   ... you have static external content e.g. from databases or
        .po-files that you want to pull into your templates only once while
        still being able to insert dynamic data into the same template

    *   ... you are following the DRY principle by having a central BLOCK
        library that you use to style your GUI HTML components

    *   ... you do not want to use ttree because you prefer "lazy"
        precompilation (only on demand), and you want to see your changes to
        the template without running an external program first

CONFIGURATION
    Plugin behaviour can be controlled using following options:

  Options
   caching_dir
    The TwoStage plugin will store the resulting precompiled templates from
    the first stage on disk in a 'caching directory', that can be specified
    with the 'caching_dir' option.

    The directory 'TT_P_TwoStage' in your platform specific tmp-directory
    determined with the help of File::Spec->tmpdir() is the default setting
    for this option. Pass a path in order to change it to some other
    directory - it will also be automatically extended by the subdirectories
    'TT_P_TwoStage' and the plugin's class name.

    This option can NOT be set on plugin construction or calls to
    include()/process().

   dev_mode
    Set this configuration option to a TRUE value in order to disable the
    use of cached - precompiled - files, and see your changes to cached
    BLOCKs/templates immediately while still having access to the
    precompiled versions on disk for their validation.

    See also the configuration option 'dir_keys' as another interesting
    feature for development.

   ttl
    Specify the "time to live" for the precompiled versions of the
    BLOCKs/templates in seconds - 0 is 'no expiration' and the default
    setting.

   dir_keys
    Usually the keys connected to a precompiled version are included among
    other things into the file name of a BLOCK/template in order to identify
    a precompiled cached BLOCK/template on disk. This is accomplished by
    using the SHA1 hash function.

    To make the retrieval of a certain caching file easier for humans, the
    configuration parameter 'dir_keys' lets you include the keys into the
    file path of the precompiled cached BLOCK/template. This behaviour might
    be handy in cases where one wants to inspect the precompiled versions
    produced.

    Set 'dir_keys' either to an array reference holding a selection of keys
    or a scalar holding a TRUE value for all keys. This feature is available
    in development mode only! See also configuration option 'dev_mode'.

    See also the section 'Caching with plugin object methods process() and
    include()' for more on the 'keys' parameter.

   namespace
    This option can come to rescue in situations where identities of cached
    BLOCK/template versions on disk can be ambigious relying only on the
    standard measures taken by this plugin in order to disambiguate cached
    disk versions (see section 'Avoiding disk cache overlaps' below).

    If e.g. you choose not to subclass this module for an application you
    can ensure the segmentation of applications by setting the 'namespace'
    configuration option accordingly. In this example however this approach
    has the drawback that you need to set this configuration option in each
    template on plugin construction:

        USE TwoStage( namespace => application_name );

   runtime_tag_style
    Set this option to one of the predefined tag styles TT is offering like
    'php', 'mason', 'html', ..., and that are accepted by TT as a value to
    its 'TAG_STYLE' configuration option or 'TAGS' directive. Default is:
    star ([* *]).

    Excursus: precompilation tag style

    The precompilation tag style is always the tag style set in the TT
    configuration or 'default'. A tag style defined local to the file the
    plugin is being called in ( by means of the 'TAGS'-directive at the
    beginning of the file) will be handled correctly - this file scoped tag
    style will also be used in the BLOCK to be precompiled as precompilation
    tag style.

    Changing the tag style only for a certain BLOCK that is to be
    precompiled is not possible, as the 'TAGS' directive can be set only on
    per template file basis. A centralized configuration of the
    precompilation tag style to be used is not available to date.

   tt_cache_size
    As one can produce a lot of precompiled versions of a single
    BLOCK/template controlled by this plugin using the 'keys' feature of
    process()/include(), it might be advisable in some situations to set the
    CACHE_SIZE TT configuration option to a positive value in order to curb
    memory consumption when having a TT singleton object around in a
    persistent environment.

    As the plugin uses a provider object specific to the plugin it will not
    respect the CACHE_SIZE configuration property possibly set in your main
    TT configuration. Use this method in order to set the CACHE_SIZE
    configuration property for the plugin's specific provider object. By
    default all precompiled templates are cached.

    In contrast to all the other configuration options - except
    'caching_dir' - this option can only be set as class data.

  Setting options
    Configuration options may be set in different ways and with different
    scopes.

   Setting options in TT configuration
    This plugin can be configured using the configuration hash provided to
    the Template Toolkit-constructor. Put your plugin configuration options
    in a hash, and reference it in the TT configuration hash using the key
    'TwoStage'.

    Sample code:

       Template->new( { ..., TwoStage => { namespace => 'My::Application', ... } } );

    The configuration options will apply to all TwoStage plugin-objects
    created in this TT object. Note that this does NOT hold true for derived
    classes of the plugin!

    Note! In order to avoid disk cache overlaps of applications using the
    TwoStage plugin without subclassing, configure a unique namespace or a
    separate caching directory. See also 'Avoiding disk cache overlaps'
    below.

   Setting options via subclassing
    This plugin is subclassable. Configuration with scope restricted to the
    subclass can be achieved by using the inheritable class data accessors
    provided (see sample code below).

    Subclassing allows you to customize your plugin behaviour at a single
    place, and to complement the caching keys via a possible callback method
    extend_keys(). At the same time it avoids disk cache overlaps for
    applications sharing the same caching directory as long as the derived
    plugin is not used in different applications.

    Subclasses will not read the plugin options specified in the TT
    configuration hash when configuring.

    Sample code:

       # sample code is based on an imaginary Catalyst application Your::Application

       package Your::Application::Template::Plugin::TwoStage;
       use base qw( Template::Plugin::TwoStage );

       __PACKAGE__->caching_dir( Your::Application->config->{home}.'/tmp' );
       __PACKAGE__->dev_mode( 1 );
       __PACKAGE__->ttl( 60 * 60 ); # 1 h
       __PACKAGE__->dir_keys( 1 );
       __PACKAGE__->runtime_tag_style( 'html' );

       sub extend_keys {
            my $plugin = shift; # the callback receives the plugin object as 1st parameter
        
            my $s = $plugin->{CONTEXT}->stash;

            # get Catalyst context from stash
            my $c = $s->get( 'c' );
            my $r = $c->request;

            # hook method for adding standard keys - return the keys => value -hash by reference!
            { domain => $r->uri->authority,
              method => $r->method,
              logged_in => $c->user_exists
            };

       }

    Don't forget to add your subclass to the plugin base of your
    TT2-configuration:

            PLUGIN_BASE => [ 'Your::Application::Template::Plugin' ]

    or declare it via the PLUGINS TT2-configuration option

            PLUGINS => { TwoStage => 'Your::Application::Template::Plugin::TwoStage', ... }

   Setting options as named parameters to USE or include()/process()
    Any option set via subclassing or the TT configuration hash can be
    overridden on plugin construction ( 'USE TwoStage()' ) or even on the
    call of the include() or precompile()-methods at your will with only
    restricted scope. Configuration provided on plugin construction will
    apply to this specific plugin object only; configuration provided as
    parameters to include()/process() only to the specific plugin object
    call.

    Sample code:

       USE TwoStage( ttl => 1000 );
       TwoStage.process( template => 'some', ttl => 0 );

    Note! The following options can not be overridden this way: caching_dir,
    tt_cache_size

  Object hook methods
   extend_keys
    With this callback method it is possible to merge some default keys into
    the template signature. The values of the keys introduced this way will
    be dominated by the values of identical keys passed to process() or
    include(). Return a hash reference mapping standard signature keys to
    its values!

    Have a look at the sample code above (section 'Setting options via
    subclassing').

    When setting options in the TT configuration hash simply add a reference
    to your extend_keys-function with key 'extend_keys'. It will receive the
    plugin object as the first parameter when being called.

       Template->new( 
            { ..., 
              TwoStage => { 
                    extend_keys => sub { 
                            my $plugin = shift; 
                                        
                            return { key => $value };  
                    }, ... 
   
              } 
            } 
       );

  Avoiding disk cache overlaps
    Having precompiled a BLOCK/template the TwoStage plugin tries to assign
    an unique as possible identity to it - refered to as 'signature' later
    -, and writes it to disk into the configured caching directory (see also
    corresponding option 'caching_dir') using a SHA1 fingerprint of the
    signature as its file name.

   What is the unique signature made up of and how unique is it?
    * template path

      If the component processed with the TwoStage plugin is a template, the
      template's path is included in the signature.

      Template paths are relative to a template provider object configured
      and might also be relative to some entry in the provider's
      INCLUDE_PATH or an equivalent (this does not apply to providers
      configured to serve templates by absolute path obviously).

    * BLOCK name

      If the component processed with the TwoStage plugin is a BLOCK its
      name is included into the signature. In order to make the BLOCK name
      template spanning unique we augment the BLOCK name with the values of
      TT meta variables 'component.callers' and 'component.name' - which in
      turn is the call stack of BLOCKs and templates to the BLOCK from the
      outermost file the BLOCK was included in.

      The uniqueness of BLOCK names achieved however is limited as it is
      still relative to the template providers and their configuration (see
      previous item).

    * plugin class name

      The precompiled BLOCK/template versions will be saved in a
      subdirectory under the caching directory specified and named after the
      class/package name of the TwoStage plugin.

    * keys passed to process()/include()

      See section 'CACHING / Caching with process() and include()' below.

   Implications
    * Unless you really know about the consequences always set the
      configuration option 'caching_dir' to a filesystem directory specific
      to the TwoStage plugin subclasses used or to the TT object in case the
      plugin is used directly.

    * Use the namespace option or add an equivalent key via the
      extend_keys() callback function if you have dynamic entries in the
      INCLUDE_PATH or an equivalent that reflects the current state auf the
      INCLUDE_PATH.

CACHING
  Caching with plugin object methods process() and include()
    Once the plugin object has been pulled into the template by means of the
    'USE' directive, calling the plugin object methods include() or
    process() against it will insert the BLOCK/template content with all the
    precompilation and caching magic delivered by this plugin into the
    template.

    Named parameters of process/include:

    *   template

        Specify the name of the BLOCK/template to be processed/included into
        the template here. Its name does not have to be template spanning
        unique. The plugin takes care that the name is local to the template
        it is defined in.

    *   keys (optional)

        Use this parameter in situations where you want to evaluate a
        certain stash variable in the precompilation stage, and that
        variable can take on only a limited set of discrete values in the
        runtime stage but has considerable influence on the precompiled
        versions. Examples for such variables might be: template language,
        user preferences, user privileges, ...

        Each combination of the values of the variables passed as 'keys'
        parameter will produce a distinct precompiled version of the
        BLOCK/template in question. Take care not to choose to many keys
        with to many values in order to produce only a reasonable number of
        precompiled versions.

        If you find some keys are supposed to be added to each and every
        call to process() or include() consider using the extend_keys() hook
        method (see also above).

    *   all of the available configuration options (optional)

        For more on those options see section "Configuration Options" in
        this documentation.

    include() is exposing an identical behaviour as process() with the
    exception that it does stash localisation in the runtime stage.

  Reset cached content with purge()
    In order to set back caching remove the cached templates from your
    caching directory. Maybe a script to assist you in this task will be
    shipped together with a future version of this plugin.

    Using purge() you remove all files from the caching directory of the
    class - use this to set back caching from within templates. This method
    is used mainly in the self tests of this module. Maybe there are even
    more useful applications for it - so it became a public class method.

            [% TwoStage = USE TwoStage; 
               TwoStage.purge;
            %]

  STAT_TTL and caching
    Please note that the STAT_TTL configuration of TT will not work for
    cached BLOCKs/templates as you make modifications to the "source"
    BLOCKS/templates of those cached templates. You should turn off caching
    instead using the plugin option 'dev_mode'.

EXPORTS
  TT configuration
    The compiled plugin configuration is saved with key '_TwoStage' in the
    main TT configuration hash.

  TT stash
    There is a temporary stash entry 'TwoStage_precompile_mode = 1;' in the
    precompilation stage of template processing.

HEURISTICS
    In order to avoid common pitfalls when using this module you find some
    tips and reminders below:

    *   Templates used as fragments with runtime directives ought to be
        controlled by the TwoStage plugin themselves! This ensures that such
        templates can be included into another template either at runtime or
        at precompilation stage.

    *   Upstream keys from included templates ( fragments ) must be
        incorporated into the 'keys' option of the including template!
        Explanation: They have to be known ex ante meaning prior to a test
        for a cached version of a template and can therefor not easily be
        collected from upstream templates automatically!

    *   Situation: A template A includes another template B while both are
        using the TwoStage plugin. In addition you pass parameters on
        invocation of INCLUDE, PROCESS to template B. Add those parameters
        to the 'keys' option when calling the TwoStage plugin in template B
        and use them at precompilation stage. This way you can include
        template B at runtime and at precompilation at your will.

    *   Ensure there are no BLOCK definitions inside the BLOCK to be
        TwoStage processed! This is nothing specific to the TwoStage plugin
        really, but is a common mistake. Simply put those BLOCKs outside the
        BLOCK to be TwoStage processed. They will be visible to it anyway.

    *   When altering option 'dev_mode' on plugin object construction or on
        calls to the methods process()/include() one has to be cautious in
        situations where calls to the TwoStage plugin methods
        process()/include() are nested: Remember to alter the option in the
        outermost call to achieve the desired effect!
