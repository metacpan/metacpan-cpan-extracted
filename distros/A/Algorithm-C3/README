NAME
    Algorithm::C3 - A module for merging hierarchies using the C3 algorithm

SYNOPSIS
      use Algorithm::C3;

      # merging a classic diamond
      # inheritance graph like this:
      #
      #    <A>
      #   /   \
      # <B>   <C>
      #   \   /
      #    <D>

      my @merged = Algorithm::C3::merge(
          'D',
          sub {
              # extract the ISA array
              # from the package
              no strict 'refs';
              @{$_[0] . '::ISA'};
          }
      );

      print join ", " => @merged; # prints D, B, C, A

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the C3 algorithm. I have broken this out into
    it's own module because I found myself copying and pasting it way too
    often for various needs. Most of the uses I have for C3 revolve around
    class building and metamodels, but it could also be used for things like
    dependency resolution as well since it tends to do such a nice job of
    preserving local precedence orderings.

    Below is a brief explanation of C3 taken from the Class::C3 module. For
    more detailed information, see the "SEE ALSO" section and the links
    there.

  What is C3?
    C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method
    resolution order under multiple inheritance. It was first introduced in
    the language Dylan (see links in the "SEE ALSO" section), and then later
    adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order) for the new-style
    classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as the
    'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot
    objects as well.

  How does C3 work.
    C3 works by always preserving local precedence ordering. This
    essentially means that no class will appear before any of it's
    subclasses. Take the classic diamond inheritance pattern for instance:

         <A>
        /   \
      <B>   <C>
        \   /
         <D>

    The standard Perl 5 MRO would be (D, B, A, C). The result being that A
    appears before C, even though C is the subclass of A. The C3 MRO
    algorithm however, produces the following MRO (D, B, C, A), which does
    not have this same issue.

    This example is fairly trivial, for more complex examples and a deeper
    explanation, see the links in the "SEE ALSO" section.

FUNCTION
    merge ($root, $func_to_fetch_parent, $cache)
        This takes a $root node, which can be anything really it is up to
        you. Then it takes a $func_to_fetch_parent which can be either a
        CODE reference (see SYNOPSIS above for an example), or a string
        containing a method name to be called on all the items being
        linearized. An example of how this might look is below:

          {
              package A;

              sub supers {
                  no strict 'refs';
                  @{$_[0] . '::ISA'};
              }

              package C;
              our @ISA = ('A');
              package B;
              our @ISA = ('A');
              package D;
              our @ISA = ('B', 'C');
          }

          print join ", " => Algorithm::C3::merge('D', 'supers');

        The purpose of $func_to_fetch_parent is to provide a way for "merge"
        to extract the parents of $root. This is needed for C3 to be able to
        do it's work.

        The $cache parameter is an entirely optional performance measure,
        and should not change behavior.

        If supplied, it should be a hashref that merge can use as a private
        cache between runs to speed things up. Generally speaking, if you
        will be calling merge many times on related things, and the parent
        fetching function will return constant results given the same
        arguments during all of these calls, you can and should reuse the
        same shared cache hash for all of the calls. Example:

          sub do_some_merging {
              my %merge_cache;
              my @foo_mro = Algorithm::C3::Merge('Foo', \&get_supers, \%merge_cache);
              my @bar_mro = Algorithm::C3::Merge('Bar', \&get_supers, \%merge_cache);
              my @baz_mro = Algorithm::C3::Merge('Baz', \&get_supers, \%merge_cache);
              my @quux_mro = Algorithm::C3::Merge('Quux', \&get_supers, \%merge_cache);
              # ...
          }
