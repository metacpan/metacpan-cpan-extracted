VERSION

This is Win32::GUI::SplashScreen v0.04

INTRODUCTION

Win32::GUI::SplashScreen is a module that works with Win32::GUI
to implement a Windows application splash screen.

It can generate a simple splash screen from basic text information,
or use a supplied image.  The splash screen can be configured to
have a minimum display time (so that users always have time
to read any information), and can be taken down automatically
once your program reaches the dialog phase.

REQUIRES

Win32::GUI v1.02 or higher
Win32::GUI::DIBitmap (for JPEG support)

DOCUMENTATION

There is full POD documentation inside the SplashScreen.pm file.
There are demonstration scripts provided, showing most of the
features.
