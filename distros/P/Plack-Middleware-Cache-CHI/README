NAME

    Plack::Middleware::Cache::CHI - Caching Reverse Proxy for Plack

VERSION

    version 0.102

SYNOPSIS

        my $chi = CHI->new(
            driver => 'File',
            root_dir => 'common/cache',
        );
    
        enable 'Cache::CHI', chi => $chi, rules => [
            qr{^/api/}          => undef,
            qr{\.(jpg|png)$}    => { expires_in => '5 min' },
        ], scrub => [ 'Set-Cookie' ], cachequeries => 1;

DESCRIPTION

    Enable HTTP caching for Plack-based applications.

    Mathing URI's (rules) are cached with the specified expiry time / ttl
    value to the CHI cache.

    Current implementation (on master branch) does not support cache
    validation. See devel branch for work in progress towards this.

SEE ALSO

    This module is largely based on Rack::Cache by Ryan Tomayko. See
    http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/ for more information.

    This module was earlier called Plack::Middleware::Cache and available
    only thru github because of name conflict with another similar CPAN
    module.
