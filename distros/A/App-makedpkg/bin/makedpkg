=head1 NAME

makedpkg - Facilitate building Debian packages with templates

=head1 VERSION

version 0.05

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<makedpkg> command line application helps building Debian packages based
on configuration files and templates.

=head1 OPTIONS

    -c --config        configuration file (makedpkg.{yml,json,...} by default)
    -v --verbose       enable verbose output
    -t --templates     template directory (./makedpkg by default)
    --init             initialize or update template directory
    -n --dry           don't build, just show
    -p --prepare       don't build, just prepare sources
    -f --force         use the force, Luke!

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Unless explicitly specified via the C<config> option, a config file with name
C<makedpkg.yaml> (or any other extension recognized by L<Config::Any>) is
expected. Important configuration variables include:

=over 4

=item name

package name

=item version

package version

=item author

package author

=item changes

changes to be used in C<changelog> template

=item timestamp

timestamp to be used in C<changelog> template

=item section

section to be used in C<control> template

=item priority

priority to be used in C<control> template (for instance C<extra>)

=item build_depends

build dependencies, to be used in C<control> template (for instance C<< perl (>= 5.14) >>)

=item binary_depends

binary dependencies, to be used in C<control> template

=item architecture

architecture, to be used in C<control> template

=item description

description, to be used in C<control> template

=item build

Build configuration, consisting of C<directory>, C<before>, C<files>, and
C<options>.

=over

=item directory

Directory to build package in (default is C<debuild>).

=item before

List of commands to execute before build. Commands are executed before files
are copied to the package directory, so more files can be generated or
processed via commands listed in this field.

=item files

package files, to be used in C<install> template (L<see Debian
manual|http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dother.en.html#install>).
Files can be specified as mapping which files to copy to which directory, such
as

    files:
        copy:
            "lib/*": "srv/myapp/lib"
            "index.html": "srv/myapp"

and/or as list which directories and files to copy from to which directory

    files:
        to: srv/myapp
        from:
            - lib
            - index.html

=item command

Command to execute build. Set to C<debuild> by default. This option can be used
for instance to add command line options, e.g. C<debuils -uc -us>.

=back

=item verbose

Autmatically set to C<0> or C<1> by the C<--verbose> command line flag, this
variable is used to disable or enable verbose mode of C<debhelper> in the default
C<rules> template.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATON EXPANSION

After reading the config file, all values having the form C<`...`> are expanded
by executing C<...> in a shell. For instance

    curdir: `pwd`

Will be expanded by setting C<curdir> to the output of command C<pwd>. To give
a more complex example, the following config file value can be used to get the
date of the latest git commit in RFC form: 

    timestamp: "`git log -n1 --format=\"%ad\" --date=rfc`"

=head1 TEMPLATES

Template are evaluated with L<Text::Template>, so make sure to escape braces
(C<{> and C<}>) with a backslash (C<\>). All configuration values are available
as template variables.

The CPAN distribution of this packages includes a set of default templates
which are used if no template directory is selected with option C<templates>.
use C<--init> to copy these default templates into subdirectory C<makedpkg>
for further modification. 

Typical templates files include:

=over

=item

C<control> (included as default template)

=item

C<changelog> (included as default template)

=item

C<rules> (included as default template)

=item

C<compat> (included as default template)

=item

C<source/format> (included as default template)

You should remove this file unless you explicitly include the sources.

=item

the control scripts C<preinst>, C<postinst>, C<prerm>, and C<postrm>

=item

C<copyright>

=item

C<upstart>
