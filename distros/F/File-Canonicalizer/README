File-Canonicalizer

Sometimes files must be compared semantically, that is their contents,
not their forms are to be compared.
Sometimes files must be unified and cleaned from any cosmetic additions.
Sometimes a kind of file changes (contents or form) must be recognized.
This module might be useful for such tasks.

The module File::Canonicalizer works with ASCII files and allows to converse
files to a canonicalized form.
Choice of conversion steps is flexible and can be adjusted to individual kinds
of files.
   file_canonicalizer ( <input_file>                                   # default is STDIN
                      , <output_file>                                  # default is STDOUT 
                      , remove_comments_started_with_<regular_express> # if empty, ignore comments
                      , 'replace_adjacent_tabs_and_spaces_with_1_space'
                      , 'replace_adjacent_slashes_with_single_slash'
                      , 'remove_white_characters_from_line_edges'
                      , 'remove_empty_lines'
                      , 'convert_to_lowercased'
                      , 'remove_leading_zeroes_in_numbers'
                      , 'sort_lines_lexically'
                      , <replaced_substring>
                      , <replacing_substring> );

All parameters, beginning with the 3rd, are interpreted as boolean values
true or false. A corresponding action will be executed only if its parameter value is true.
This means, that each of literals between apostrophes '' can be shortened to
single arbitrary character or digit 1-9.

List of parameters can be shortened, that is any amount of last parameters can be skipped.
In this case the actions, corresponding skipped parameters, will not be executed.

EXAMPLES

Read from STDIN, write to STDOUT and remove all strings, beginning with '#' :

   file_canonicalizer ('','','#');

Create canonicalized cron table (on UNIX/Linux) in any of equivalent examples:

   file_canonicalizer('path/cron_table','/tmp/cron_table.canonic','#',4,5,'e','empty_lin','',9,'sort');
   file_canonicalizer('path/cron_table','/tmp/cron_table.canonic','#',4,5, 6,    7,       '',9, 10);
   file_canonicalizer('path/cron_table','/tmp/cron_table.canonic','#',1,1, 1,    1,       '',1, 1);
