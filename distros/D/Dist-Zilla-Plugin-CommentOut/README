NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CommentOut - Comment out code in your scripts and
    modules

VERSION

    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS

     [CommentOut]
     id = dev-only

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin comments out lines of code in your Perl scripts or modules
    with the provided identification. This allows you to have code in your
    development tree that gets commented out before it gets shipped by
    Dist::Zilla as a tarball.

MOTIVATION

    I use perlbrew and/or perls installed in funny places and I'd like to
    be able to run executables out of by git checkout tree without invoking
    perl -Ilib on every call. To that end I write something like this:

     #!/usr/bin/env perl
     
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use lib::findbin '../lib';  # dev-only
     use App::MyApp;

    That is lovely, except that the main toolchain installers EUMM and MB
    will convert /usr/bin/perl but not /usr/bin/env perl to the correct
    perl when the distribution is installed. There is a handy plugin
    [SetScriptShebang] that solves that problem but the use lib::findbin
    '../lib'; is problematic because ../lib relative to the install
    location might not be right! With both [SetScriptShebang] and this
    plugin, I can fix both problems:

     [SetScriptShebang]
     [CommentOut]

    And my script will be converted to:

     #!perl
     
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     #use lib::findbin '../lib';  # dev-only
     use App::MyApp;

    Which is the right thing for CPAN. Since lines are commented out, line
    numbers are retained.

PROPERTIES

 id

    The comment id to search for. The default is dev-only.

 remove

    Remove lines instead of comment them out.

 begin

    For block comments, the id to use for the beginning of the block. Block
    comments are off unless both begin and end are specified.

 end

    For block comments, the id to use for the beginning of the block. Block
    comments are off unless both begin and end are specified.

SEE ALSO

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Comment

      Does something very similar. I did actually do a survay of
      Dist::Zilla plugins before writing this one, but apparently I missed
      this one. Anyway I prefer [CommentOut] as it is configurable.
