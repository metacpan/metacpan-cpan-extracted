Speech::Recognizer::ViaVoice version 0.02


NAME
    Speech::Recognizer::ViaVoice - Perl wrappers for IBM's ViaVoice speech
    Recognizer library.

SYNOPSIS
    use Speech::Recognizer::ViaVoice;

    $| = 1;

    if (0 == connectEngine) {

        if ( 0 == defineVocab('myTestVocab', ['hello','world','quit']) ) {
            print 'please say "hello", "world", or "quit" at each prompt...', "\n";

            while (0 == startListening) {
                print "speak> ";
                if (0 == recognize) {
                    my ($s, $score) = (getWord, getScore);
                    if (defined($s)) {
                        printf "%s, score=%d\n", $s, $score;
                        if ($s eq 'quit') {
                            exit 0;
                        }
                    } else {
                        printf "not recognized!\n";
                    }
                }
                stopListening;
            }
        }

        disconnectEngine;
    }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides very basic use of IBM's ViaVoice library
    (http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/enterprise/te_3.html) in perl. It
    allows its user to pass a list of speech commands for recognition in a
    perl list, connect to the engine, and request recognized spoken words.
    The most notable feature missing from the current version is the ability
    to select different ViaVoice users. I plan to add this functionality
    shortly, but for now you must use the default user.

    Consult the ViaVoice documentation for ViaVoice setup. Most will
    probably just need to run vvstartuserguru, which requires a java runtime
    environment. Results will be better if you take the time to do a little
    training to your own voice in this utility.

    You can use this perl module for reconition of words from IBM's vocab
    dictionary for your chosen locale without further preparation. To
    recognize words not available in the dictionary or to recognize phrases,
    you need to create a file with phonetic spellings for use by the
    provided script pronunciations.pl (installed in /usr/local/bin by
    default). This utility reads a text file whose name is supplied as its
    sole argument. The file should contain lines with two fields separated
    by a tab character:

            Deborah --- TAB -->D EH B OW R AX
            Deborah --- TAB -->D EH B AXR R AX
            Axl Rose -- TAB -->AE K S AX L  R OW Z

    The text on the left is the word or phrase to be recognized, and the
    text on the right is a phonetic spelling of the format specified in the
    ViaVoice docs (section 3 of /usr/doc/ViaVoice/bpreadme.txt in my
    installation). As in the example, a word or phrase might have more than
    one common pronunciation. You can provide all of them, one on each line.

    pronunciations.pl will most likely require super user privileges to
    write its output to files in the ViaVoice lib directory:

            /usr/lib/ViaVoice/vocabs/langs/En_US/pools/

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, first change the line in Makefile.PL that looks
    like the following to reflect your locale:

        'DEFINE'            => '-DLOCALE=\"En_US\"',

    Then, type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

    Note: "make test" will prompt you to say a word and attempt to recognize
    it. It will fail unless you have IBM ViaVoice setup and your microphone
    connected and ready to go.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires IBM's ViaVoice to run.
