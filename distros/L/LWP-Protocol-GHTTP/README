NAME

    LWP::Protocol::GHTTP - (DEPRECATED) Provide GHTTP support for
    LWP::UserAgent via HTTP::GHTTP.

SYNOPSIS

        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use LWP::UserAgent;
    
        # create a new object
        LWP::Protocol::implementor('http', 'LWP::Protocol::GHTTP');
        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
        my $res = $ua->get('http://www.example.com');
        # note that we can only support the GET HEAD and POST verbs.

DESCRIPTION

    This module depends on the GNOME libghttp
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libghttp project. That project
    is no longer in development. If you are trying to use this module,
    you'd likely do better to just use LWP::Protocol::http or
    LWP::Protocol::https.

    LWP::Protocol::GHTTP is only capable of dispatching requests using the
    GET, POST, or HEAD verbs.

    You have been warned.

    The LWP::Protocol::GHTTP module provides support for using HTTP schemed
    URLs with LWP. This module is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling,
    but since it takes over the HTTP scheme, you have to tell LWP we want
    to use this plug-in by calling LWP::Protocol's implementor function.

    This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled
    in v6.16 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for
    the CPAN tool-chain. Applications that need GHTTP support can just
    declare their dependency on LWP::Protocol::GHTTP and will no longer
    need to know what underlying modules to install.

CAVEATS

    WARNING!

    This module depends on the GNOME libghttp
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libghttp project. That project
    is no longer in development. If you are trying to use this module,
    you'd likely do better to just use LWP::Protocol::http or
    LWP::Protocol::https.

    Also, LWP::Protocol::GHTTP is only capable of dispatching requests
    using the GET, POST, or HEAD verbs.

FUNCTIONS

    LWP::Protocol::GHTTP inherits all functions from LWP::Protocol and
    provides the following overriding functions.

 request

        my $response = $ua->request($request, $proxy, undef);
        my $response = $ua->request($request, $proxy, '/tmp/sss');
        my $response = $ua->request($request, $proxy, \&callback, 1024);

    Dispatches a request over the HTTP protocol and returns a response
    object. Refer to LWP::UserAgent for description of the arguments.
