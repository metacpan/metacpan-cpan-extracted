Todo Items:

  * OO Interface for more customization
  * Ability to handle header differently than the rest of the file
    * Should also be able to call something on the header in chlid
      processes.
  * UTF-8 and other encoding support
  * SUpport CRLF line endings on all platforms (:crlf)
  * Documentation on parallel_ that these methods do a SEEK_EOF, so you
    shouldn't use them on things like terminal input.  There's a little
    note already, but it's not particularly clear.
  * A write routine wouldn't be a bad thing.
  * A more detailed CONTRIBUTING file
