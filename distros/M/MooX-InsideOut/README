NAME
    MooX::InsideOut - Inside out objects for Moo

SYNOPSIS
      package MyClass;
      use Moo;
      use MooX::InsideOut;

DESCRIPTION
    MooX::InsideOut causes all accessors generated to be stored outside the
    object itself. This is useful for extending non-Moo classes whose
    internals you don't want to change, or which aren't hash based.

    Inside out objects are not recommended for general use aside from where
    they are specifically required.
