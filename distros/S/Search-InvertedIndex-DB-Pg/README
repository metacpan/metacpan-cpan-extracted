NAME
    Search::InvertedIndex::DB::Pg - A Postgres backend for
    Search::InvertedIndex.

SYNOPSIS
      use Search::InvertedIndex;
      use Search::InvertedIndex::DB::Pg;

      my $db = Search::InvertedIndex::DB::Pg->new(
            -db_name    => "testdb",
            -hostname   => "test.example.com",
            -port       => 5432,
            -username   => "testuser",
            -password   => "testpass",
            -table_name => "siindex",
            -lock_mode  => "EX",
      );

      my $map = Search::InvertedIndex->new( -database => $db );

DESCRIPTION
    An interface allowing Search::InvertedIndex to store and retrieve data
    from a PostgreSQL database. All the data is stored in a single table,
    which will be created automatically if it does not exist when "new" is
    called.

METHODS
    new
          my $db = Search::InvertedIndex::DB::Pg->new(
                -db_name    => "testdb",
                -hostname   => "test.example.com",
                -port       => 5432,
                -username   => "testuser",
                -password   => "testpass",
                -table_name => "siindex",
                -lock_mode  => "EX",
          );

        "-db_name" and "-table_name" are mandatory. "-lock_mode" defaults to
        "EX". "-port is optional" and defaults to not being specified..

    open
          $db->open;

        Opens the database in the mode specified when "new" was called.
        Croaks on error, returns true otherwise. Trying to open a
        nonexistent database/table combination in "SH" mode is considered to
        be an error. Opening an already-open database/table combination
        isn't.

    lock
          $db->lock( -lock_mode => "EX" );

        The "-lock_mode" parameter is required; allowed values are "EX",
        "SH" and "UN". Returns true on success; croaks on error.

    status
          my $opened = $db->status( "-open" );
          my $lock_mode = $db->status( "-lock_mode" );

        Allowed requests are "-open" and "-lock_mode". "-lock_mode" can only
        be called on an open database. "-lock" is a synonym for
        "-lock_mode". Croaks if sent an invalid request, or on error.

    put
          $db->put( -key => "foo", -value => "bar" );

        Both parameters are mandatory. Any others will be silently ignored.
        Returns true on success and false on error.

    get
          my $value = $db->get( -key => "foo" );

        Croaks if no "-key" supplied.

    delete
          $db->delete( -key => "foo" );

    close
          $db->close;

    clear
          $db->clear;

        Clears out *all* indexing data.
