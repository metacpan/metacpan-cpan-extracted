PGObject-Composite-Role

This provides Moo/Moose support for PGObject::Composite stored procedure
mappings.  This module allows composite data structures to be mapped into 
arguments of stored procedures with a variable named 'self' or 'in_self.'

This can be used with PGObject::Type::Composite for PG Composite types or
PGObject::Type::JSON for serializing to JSON.
