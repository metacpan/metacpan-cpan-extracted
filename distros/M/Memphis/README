Memphis
=======

Perl bindings for the C library "libmemphis" that provides a generic glib/cairo
based OSM renderer library. What does this mean? Well it means that you now use
the original data files from OpenStreeMaps and to create your own PNG or any
other file format supported by Cairo (PNG, PDF, SVG, etc).

For more information about libmemphis refer to the library's web site:
