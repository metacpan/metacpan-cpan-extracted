Revision history for Future-IO-Redis

0.002  2026-01-17
    - Bug Fix: Concurrent command response matching
        - Fixed race condition where multiple async commands on a single
          connection could receive mismatched responses
        - Implemented Response Queue pattern with FIFO ordering
        - Commands now register in inflight queue before sending
        - Single reader coroutine processes responses in order
    - New Features:
        - Added inflight_count() method to check pending commands
        - Added _wait_for_inflight_drain() for pipeline/PubSub synchronization
    - Documentation:
        - Added CONCURRENT COMMANDS section to POD
        - Documented Response Queue pattern and best practices
    - Testing:
        - Added t/92-concurrency/response-ordering.t test suite
        - Tests for concurrent SET, GET, mixed command types
        - Stress test with 100 concurrent commands
        - Inflight tracking verification
