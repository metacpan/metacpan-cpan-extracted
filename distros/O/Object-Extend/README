Object-Extend version 0.4.0
===========================

This module allows objects to be extended with per-object methods, similar to the use of
singleton methods in Ruby. Object methods are added to an object-specific shim class
(known as an "eigenclass"), which extends the object's original class. The original class
is left unchanged.
