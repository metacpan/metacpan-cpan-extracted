=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::WiX::Diagnostics - The list of exceptions that Perl::Dist::WiX catches.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the exceptions that Perl::Dist::WiX uses in 
case an error occurs.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Note that most errors are defined as exception objects in the PDWiX,
PDWiX::Parameter, and PDWiX::Caught classes.  Those errors will start 
with C<< Perl::Dist::WiX error: >>

Some parameter errors will be caught by Object::InsideOut. (Those errors 
will be in the OIO class, and are not listed here.)

This is not a complete list, but covers most of the exceptions that are 
caught in Perl::Dist::WiX and the modules that come with it.

=head2 C<< Perl::Dist::WiX error: >>

=over 

=item C<< Parameter missing or invalid >>

(Implemented as a PDWiX::Parameter class)
 
The parameter mentioned is either missing (and it is required) or 
invalid (for example, a string where an integer is required).

Often, but not always, exactly why the parameter is invalid is 
mentioned, as well.

=item C<< Internal Error: Missing or invalid id >>

A Perl::Dist::WiX::Base::Component has been created with a 
missing or invalid id parameter.  This should not happen.

=item C<< Internal Error: Calling as_string improperly (most likely, not calling derived method) >>

C<< Perl::Dist::WiX::Base::Component->as_spaces() >> is being called instead of 
one of its derived methods.

=item C<< Internal Error: Odd number of parameters to add_directories_id >>

The L<< Perl::Dist::WiX->add_directories_id()|/add_directories_id >> method 
takes pairs of directories and the id to use when adding them.  Somehow, 
these got mismatched.

=item C<< Can't add the directories required >>

The directories that are requested to be added under this directory object
aren't a subdirectory of the directory being referred to by the directory 
object, so directory objects cannot be created within this object for them.

=item C<< Internal Error: Parameters not passed in hash reference >>

The method referred to takes all its parameters as a hash reference (i.e. 
within C<< { } >> brackets) and this was not done.

=item C<< Can't create intermediate directories when creating %s (unsuccessful search for %s) >>

Perl::Dist::WiX::Directory->add_directory could not find a directory 
object to add the new directory object to. (add_directory can only create
a directory object immediately under another one.)

=item C<< Complex feature tree not implemented in Perl::Dist::WiX %s. >>

Having more than one feature (and supporting conditional installation
of features by the user) has not been implemented in Perl::Dist::WiX 
at this point.

=item C<< Error reading directory %s: %s >>

Something happened when attempting to get a list of files for the 
directory mentioned.

=item C<< Error reading packlist file %s: %s >>

Something happened when attempting to read the packlist file mentioned.

=item C<< Could not add %s >>

The file to be added to the Perl distribution was completely outside the
distribution's directories, so a directory object could not be found to 
refer to.

=item C<< The output_dir directory is not writable >>

The directory specified by the C<output_dir> parameter is not writable by
the current user.  Specify a different directory, or have your 
administrator set the directory so it can be written to.

=item C<< %s does not exist or is not readable >>

Trying to use light.exe to compile a file that cannot be read or it
does not exist (someone may be trying to modify your file system from 
under you?)

=item C<< Failed to find %s (Probably compilation error in %s) >>

The first file mentioned could not be found.  There was probably a 
error in compilation of the second file.

=item C<< Could not open file %s for writing [$!] [$^E] >>

Perl::Dist::WiX could not open the file mentioned.  The reason should
be specified within the brackets.

=item C<< Fragment %s does not exist >>

An attempt to add a file or files to a fragment that had not been 
created yet has been detected.

=item C<< %s does not support Perl %s >> or C<< Cannot generate perl, missing $s method in %s >>

You are attempting to install a version of the perl interpreter that 
Perl::Dist::WiX does not support yet.  If this is a new version of 
the interpreter, or if Perl::Dist::WiX is documented as supporting 
this version of the interpreter, please report this as a bug.

=item C<< Failed to resolve Module::CoreList hash for %s >>

We could not get a hash of modules from L<Module::CoreList|Module::CoreList> 
for the version of Perl mentioned.

=item C<< Unknown package %s >>

An improper package name was passed to L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>binary_url|/binary_url>.

=item C<< Checkpoints require a temp_dir to be set >>

There was no C<temp_dir> parameter set and a checkpoint routine was called.

=item C<< Failed to find checkpoint directory >>

L<< Perl::Dist::WiX->checkpoint_load|Perl::Dist::WiX::Checkpoint/checkpoint_load >> 
could not find a directory C<temp_dir>\checkpoint to load a checkpoint from.

Either a checkpoint was never saved, or the temporary directory is 
different, or the checkpoint was deleted.

=item C<< Did not provide a toolchain resolver >>

A L<Perl::Dist::Util::Toolchain|Perl::Dist::Util::Toolchain> 
object was not passed to 
L<< Perl::Dist::WiX->install_perl_toolchain|Perl::Dist::WiX::BuildPerl/install_perl_toolchain >>, 
and that method was unable to create one.

=item C<< Cannot install CPAN modules yet, perl is not installed >>

Perl::Dist::WiX->install_cpan_upgrades was called before 
Perl::Dist::WiX->install_perl.

=item C<< CPAN script %s failed >>

An error happened creating or executing the script to upgrade or install 
a CPAN module. The error will usually be mentioned on this line, and the 
debug.err and debug.out files (in the C<output_dir>) can be examined for 
assistance in determining what happened.

=item C<< Failure detected during cpan upgrade, stopping [%s] >> or C<< Failure detected installing %s, stopping [%s] >>

The script to upgrade or install a CPAN module reported an error.
The error will usually be mentioned on this line, and the debug.err and 
debug.out files (in the C<output_dir>) can be examined for assistance in 
determining what happened.

=item C<< Cannot build Perl yet, dmake has not been installed >>

L<install_dmake|/install_dmake> needs to be ran before L<install_perl|/install_perl>.

=item C<< Can't execute %s >>

We just installed something, but a test to make sure that it is executable 
did not pass.

=item C<< Didn't expect install_to to be a %s >>

The C<install_to> parameter was the wrong type. It either needs 
to be a hashref of directory mappings or a directory to install to.

=item C<< Failed to extract %s >>

L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>install_distribution|/install_distribution> or 
L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>install_distribution_from_file|/install_distribution_from_file> 
could not extract the file referred to. The file may be corrupt.

=item C<< Could not find Makefile.PL in %s >>

This module did not have a Makefile.PL when it was unpacked.

If it has only a Build.PL, it can be installed by 
L<install_module|/install_module> or L<install_modules|/install_modules>, 
but not L<install_distribution|/install_distribution>.  Otherwise, there 
was probably an extraction error.

=item C<< No .packlist found for %s. ... >>	

When this module was being installed, Perl::Dist::WiX was looking for 
a packlist in order to create a fragment for the module.

The description given with this error tells how to tell Perl::Dist::WiX to 
create the fragment another way.

=item C<< Template processing failed for $from_tt >>

L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>patch_file|/patch_file> tried to use the template 
$from_tt to create a patch, and the patch creation failed.

=item C<< Missing or invalid file $file or $file_tt in pathlist search >>

L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>patch_file|/patch_file> tried to find a file 
with these two names to create a patch, and the patch creation failed.

=item C<< Failed to find file $file >>

L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>patch_file|/patch_file> could not find the file 
to patch.

=item C<< Failed to create $dir >>

Perl::Dist::WiX tried to create a directory to cache the downloaded 
modules in, and the creastion failed.

=item C<< No write permissions for L<LWP::UserAgent> cache '$dir' >>

Perl::Dist::WiX created a directory to cache the downloaded 
modules in, but it can't write to the cache directory.

=item C<< make failed >> or C<< perl failed >>

Trying to execute make or perl failed.

=item C<< make failed (OS error) >> or C<< perl failed (OS error) >>

When make or perl was executed, an error was reported.  Check the debug.out
and debug.err files for more information. 

=item C<< CPAN modules file error: $! >>

In L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>install_module|/install_module>, we expected a file to be created
to verify that CPAN could find the module to be installed.
When install_module tried to read the file, we got the error reported.  

=item C<< The script %s does not exist >>

Install_launcher could not find a script at this location when 
creating a shortcut.

=item C<< PATH directory $dir does not exist >>

The directory being added to the PATH does not exist.

=item C<< Directory $path does not exist >>

We tried to find the path to get patches from with L<Perl::Dist::WiX-E<gt>patch_include_path|/patch_include_path>,
but the path to get the patches from does not exist. 

=item C<< Copy error: %s >>	or C<< Move error: %s >>

There was an error copying or moving a file.

=item C<< Error in archive extraction >>

The archive that was downloaded was corrupt when an extraction 
attempt was made.

=item C<< Didn't recognize archive type for $archive >>

Perl::Dist::WiX can only install files with a .zip or .tar.gz extension.

=item C<< %s has not been installed >>

The install_* routine that adds this particular package needed to be called 
before this one, but it wasn't.

=item C<< pexports failed to generate .def file >> or C<< pexports failed to generate .a file >>

pexports or dlltool had an error and was not able to generate the file required.

=item C<< Failed to make_path for %s >> or C<< Failed to remake_path for %s >>

The directory did not exist once made or remade.

=item C<< Could not write out $filename_in: File already exists. >>

The application name (as defined by the L<app_name|/app_name> parameter) 
conflicts with one of the other fragments somehow. Please choose a different 
application name.

=head2 C<< Error caught by Perl::Dist::WiX from other module: >>

These exceptions are members of the PDWiX::Caught class.

The specific problem returned from the other module is reported on the next line.

=over 

=item C<< Unknown delegation error occured >>

This error occurs after "Completed install_c_libraries in %i seconds" if 
C<< trace => 0 >> or "Pregenerating toolchain..." if C<< trace => 1 >> or 
greater.

=item C<< Failed to generate toolchain distributions >>

L<Perl::Dist::Util::Toolchain|Perl::Dist::Util::Toolchain> was not 
able to find out which modules need upgraded in the CPAN toolchain.

=item C<< Template error >>

There was a problem creating or processing the main .wxs template.

=item C<< Could not find distribution directory for Perl::Dist::WiX >>

L<File::ShareDir|File::ShareDir> could not find the directory that 
Perl::Dist::WiX uses to store its required data 
(C<< $Config{sitelib}\auto\share\Perl-Dist-WiX >>)

=back

As other errors are noticed, they will be listed here.

=head2 C<< OIO::Args error: Missing mandatory initializer '%s' for class '%s' >>

This is the Object::InsideOut equivalent of a PDWiX::Parameter error.
