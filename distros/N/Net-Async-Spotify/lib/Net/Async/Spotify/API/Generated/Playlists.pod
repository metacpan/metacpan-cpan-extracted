Type: string | Required: required
A valid access token from the Spotify Accounts service: see the Web API Authorization Guide for details. The access token must have been issued on behalf of the user.Adding items to the current user’s public playlists requires authorization of the playlist-modify-public scope; adding items to the current user’s private playlist (including collaborative playlists) requires the playlist-modify-private scope. See Using Scopes.

Type: integer | Required: optional
The position to insert the items, a zero-based index. For example, to insert the items in the first position: position=0 ; to insert the items in the third position: position=2. If omitted, the items will be appended to the playlist. Items are added in the order they appear in the uris array. For example: {"uris": ["spotify:track:4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh","spotify:track:1301WleyT98MSxVHPZCA6M"], "position": 3}

=item uris

Type: array[string] | Required: optional

   Is it possible to delete a playlist?
No, it isn’t. The reason there is no endpoint for this is explained in our Working With Playlists Guide in the section Following and Unfollowing a Playlist.

   Can I use X-HTTP-Method-Override or similar to send a DELETE request overriding the HTTP verb?
Not at the moment, the delete operation needs to be specified through a DELETE request.Try in our Web Console

=head2 reorder_or_replace_playlists_tracks

reorder_or_replace_playlists_tracks - Reorder or Replace a Playlist's Items

Either reorder or replace items in a playlist depending on the request’s parameters.
To reorder items, include range_start, insert_before, range_length and snapshot_id in the request’s body.
To replace items, include uris as either a query parameter or in the request’s body.
Replacing items in a playlist will overwrite its existing items. This operation can be used for replacing or clearing items in a playlist.

Note: Replace and reorder are mutually exclusive operations which share the same endpoint, but have different parameters.
These operations can’t be applied together in a single request.
