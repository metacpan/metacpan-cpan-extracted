Complete version history
========================

2016-12-03 v1.14 pjacklam

 * Remove BENCHMARK file. The information there was obsolete.

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL.

 * Explicitly set required version of Math::BigInt in Math/Big.pm.

 * Trim whitespace.

 * Remove author information in LICENSE file.

 * Update README file.

 * Inform that the TODO file is not up to date.

2016-04-26 v1.13 pjacklam

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ...".

 * Fix documentation error in Math::Big. (CPAN RT #60614)

 * Add patch to speed up primes(). (CPAN RT #81986)

 * Fix documentation error in Math::Big::Factors. (CPAN RT #100917)

 * Use OO-style calls, e.g., Math::BigInt->bzero(), not Math::BigInt::bzero().
   (CPAN RT #113959)

 * Use "=pod" to start POD section.

 * In the POD, replace "METHODS" header with "FUNCTIONS". OO-style calls are
   not supported, so they are functions, not methods.

 * In the POD, use "=item" for each function, not "=head2".

 * Code reformatting.

 * Remove trailing whitespace.

 * Remove unnecessary "1;" at end of file.

 * Add "use warnings" to all modules.

 * In Makefile.PL, add "#!perl" to the top, as it gives nice syntax
   highlighting in some editors.

 * In Makefile.PL, update author information.

 * In Makefile.PL, change required version of Math::BigInt to 1.82 (which
   shipped with Math::BigFloat 1.54). This is the oldest version of
   Math::BigInt (and Math::BigFloat) that work with this distribution.

 * In Makefile.PL, change "build_requires 'Test::More' => 0.42" to
   "test_requires 'Test::More' => 0.47". Test::More is only needed for testing,
   not building, and version 0.47 is the required version.

 * In Makefile.PL, change "require 5.6.2" to "require 5.006001". Math::BigInt
   requires only Perl v5.6.1, not v5.6.2.

 * Edit the "BUGS" file so it points to "rt.cpan.org".

 * Edit the "NEW" file so it points to the "CHANGES" file.

 * Remove stuff from POD that is covered in the more complete "CREDITS" file.

 * Update the bundled version of Module::Install from v0.65 to v1.16.

 * Add more entries to "MANIFEST.SKIP".

2007-04-17 1.12 Tels 182 tests

 * speed up fibonacci():
   + by not making the argument a BigInt
   + caching a few more numbers
   + removing a few needless scalar computations

 * fix bug in fibonacci() missing a few intermidiate results

 * euler() just uses BigInt's fast bexp() method and is thus now MUHC faster

 * require Math::BigInt v1.83 (and thus Perl v5.6.2)

 * bundle and use Module::Install

Math::BigInt::Constant and Math::Roman are now separate CPAN packages. Please
see L<http://search.cpan.org/>.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
