        (foo.bar.baz) without.  Filters have also been modified to not assume all
        references are arrays.
      * Add support for parameterized arrays, where each value of an array with

      * Use Dist::Zilla
      * Fix POD error
      * Add get_values to Results (Jason May)

0.40  Jan 17, 2010
      * Fix typo in POD (Jason May)

0.39  Jan 3, 2010
      * Add JSON::Any to test_requires

0.38
      * Add is_wrong predicate to Results object
      * Document the internals of Results
      * Add a has_field to Results
      * is_missing no longer returns true for arbitrary field names
      * Add many more tests to the default case

0.37
      * Don't dereference ArrayRef values with a single member. (Dennis Schön,
        RT #60425)

0.36
      * Don't die by attempting to cram a non-arrayref-ref into an array-ref.

0.35
      * Point out that D:V stops processing on the first failure

0.32  June 25, 2010
      * POD fix

0.31  April 9, 2010
      * Add valid_values to Results class

0.30  March 30, 2010
      * Fix accidental warning about the wrong field.  We DO serialize original_value!

0.29  March 10, 2010
      * Add post_filter_value to Field and populate it with the value after
        applying filters.
      * Populate original_value with the value that was submitted, unchanged.
        This is a slightly invasive change but if the field was valid then it will
        re-filter back to the same value so it is considered safe to do.
      * Change type of original_value to ArrayRef|Str to handle multiple
        values of a param.

0.28  February 2, 2010
      * Document that type will allow a TypeConstraint instance and add a test
        so if we break it, we know.
      * Rename all the tests to not include a number, since the order is not
        relevant.

      * Add flatten filter that removes all whitespace.

      * Convert to use native Moose traits
      * Pod fixes for RT#52592

        (thanks to the most awesomest person ever, jshirley.) (ed: ChangeLog
        entry written by jshirley)

0.24
      * Fix typo in unknown type constraint error message.

        attribute.

0.21
      * Fix type of Field's value attribute (Should've been an Any now that
        it is not serialized.

0.20
      * Improve Field POD
      * Add clear_value to Field and use it rather than value(undef) (which
        validates the type constraint and is just bad form.)
      * Add original_value attribute that holds the value that was submitted for
        the field.
      * Result's value is no longer serialized.

0.10
      * Change post_check's calling convention after reading some wisdom from
        nuffin: http://blog.woobling.org/2009/09/method-style-callbacks.html
      * Change internal API to use a field class rather than a bunch of hashes.
