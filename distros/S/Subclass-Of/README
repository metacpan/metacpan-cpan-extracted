NAME
    Subclass::Of - import a magic subclass

SYNOPSIS
    Create a subclass overriding a method:

       use Subclass::Of "LWP::UserAgent",
          -as      => "ImpatientUA",
          -methods => [
             sub new {
                my $self = ::SUPER();
                $self->timeout(15);
                $self->max_redirect(3);
                return $self;
             }
          ];
   
       my $ua = ImpatientUA->new;

    Create a subclass at runtime, adding roles:

       use Subclass::Of;
   
       my $subclass = subclass_of(
          "My::Class",
          -with => [qw/ My::Role Your::Role His::Role Her::Role /],
       );
   
       my $object = $subclass->new;

DESCRIPTION
    Load a class, creating a subclass of it with additional roles (Moose,
    Mouse, Moo and Role::Tiny should all work) and/or additional methods, and
    providing a lexically-scoped alias for the subclass.

  Compile-Time Usage
    To create a subclass at compile-time, use the following syntax:

       use SubClass::Of $base_class, %options;

    The following options are supported:

    `-methods`
        An arrayref of `name => coderef` pairs of methods that you wish to add
        to your subclass.

        As you might expect, you can override methods defined in the base
        class. However, because of the way `$self->SUPER::method()` is
        resolved by Perl, it will not work. Instead a `::SUPER()` function is
        provided. If called with no arguments, then it automatically calls the
        superclass method with the same arguments that the subclass was called
        with; if called with arguments, then the superclass method gets those
        arguments exactly. (If calling it with arguments, remember to include
        the invocant!)

    `-with`
        The package names of one or more roles (Moose::Role, Role::Tiny, etc)
        you wish to apply to your subclass.

    `-has`
        Attributes to apply to the child class. You can provide Moose-style
        specifications for each attribute:

           use Subclass::Of "MyClass",
              -has => [
                 foo   => (),    # default spec
                 bar   => [...],
                 baz   => {...},
                 quux  => sub { "default" },
              ];

        Note that the attribute specifications need to be supported by the OO
        framework of the parent class. Moose, Mouse and Moo all support fairly
        similar attribute specs, but they differ on some details. The `is`,
        `default` and `required` options should be pretty safe bets; `isa`
        will be fine if you're using Type::Tiny type constraints.

        If the parent class is a plain old Perl class, then a small built-in
        attribute builder is used, which assumes that the object is a blessed
        hash. The builder supports `is`, `isa` and `default` (which is always
        treated as lazy). It only builds accessors, *not* a constructor!

    `-package`
        The package name for the subclass. Usually you can ignore this;
        Subclass::Of will think one up of its own.

    `-as`
        Subclass::Of will export a lexically scoped alias for the package
        name. By lexically scoped I mean:

           {
              use Subclass::Of "LWP::UserAgent", -as => "MyUA";
              # "MyUA" is available here ...
           }
           # ... but not here

        By "alias", I mean a constant that returns the subclass' package name
        as a string. (See aliased.)

        The `-as` option allows you to name this alias. You may request
        multiple aliases using an arrayref of strings.

        If you don't provide a `-as` option, the last component of the parent
        class name (e.g. `UserAgent` for subclasses of LWP::UserAgent) will be
        used. If you don't want an alias, try `-as => []`.

  Run-Time Usage
    To create a subclass at compile-time, use the following syntax:

       use Subclass::Of;
   
       my $subclass = subclass_of($base_class, %options);

    Note that the `subclass_of` function is only exported if `use
    Subclass::Of` is called with no import list.

    The options supported are the same as with compile-time usage, except
    `-as` is ignored. (No alias is generated.)

    The return value of `subclass_of` is the name of the class as a string.

  Wrapping Subclass::Of
    If you need to provide a wrapper for Subclass::Of, and thus install scoped
    aliases into other packages, use the `install` method:

       require Subclass::Of;
       Subclass::Of->install($base, -into => $target, %options);

DIAGNOSTICS
    *Subclass::Of is overwriting function ...*
        An alias is overwriting an existing sub.

        Try setting `-as` to avoid this.

    *Subclass::Of is overwriting alias ...*
        An alias is overwriting an existing alias created by Subclass::Of.

        This can often happen if you try to create two subclasses of the same
        base class and rely on the automatically generated alias names:

           use Subclass::Of "Foo::Bar", ...;  # alias = Bar
           use Subclass::Of "Foo::Bar", ...;  # alias = Bar (warning!)

        Try explicitly setting `-as` to avoid this, or use Subclass::Of in a
        smaller lexical scope.

    There is no supported method to switch these warnings off. You should fix
    the problems they're telling you about.

CAVEATS
    Certain class builders don't play nice with certain role builders. Moose
    classes should be able to consume a mixture of Moose and Moo roles. Moo
    classes should be able to consume a mixture of Moose, Moo, Mouse and
    Role::Tiny roles. Mouse classes should be able to consume Mouse roles. Any
    class should be able to consume Role::Tiny roles, provided you don't try
    to mix in other roles at the same time. (For example, a Mouse class can
    consume a Role::Tiny role, but it can't consume a Role::Tiny role and a
    Mouse role simultaneously.)
