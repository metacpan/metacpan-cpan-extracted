        - now using perls DBI database abstraction to be compatible to all databases that are supported by DBI. Unfortunately HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL was only tested with PostgreSQL. But a special database driver is not needed anymore (read the MIGRATING file, you find it in the distribution near README)
	- new feature: save_as
	- new feature: display_as
	- made it compatible to formengine 1.0
	- removed Config.pm, created SkinClassic.pm the default skin class for HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL
	- removed dbsql_set_secret therefore added set_dbsql_secret to HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL::SkinClassic
	- dbsql_preconf knows a new special key format: __add_VARNAME_(first|last)
	- changed the meaning of dbsql_set_show_default (read POD)
	- added dbsql_set_write_null_fields
