SYNOPSIS

      # in dist.ini
      [@NGLENN]

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Dist::Zilla PluginBundle. It is roughly equivalent to the
    following dist.ini:

      ; version provider
      [RewriteVersion] ; also munges
    
      ; collect contributors list
      [Git::Contributors]
    
      ; choose files to include

      exclude_filename = README.mkdn  ; skip this generated file
      exclude_filename = Makefile.PL  ; skip this generated file
      exclude_filename = cpanfile     ; skip this generated file
    
      [PruneCruft]        ; default stuff to skip
      [ManifestSkip]      ; if -f MANIFEST.SKIP, skip those, too

      ; timestamp to Changes and  *after* release to add a new {{$NEXT}}
      ; section, so to act at the right time after release, it must actually
      ; come after Commit_Dirty_Files but before Commit_Changes in the
      ; dist.ini.  It will still act during pre-release as usual

    This distribution was forked from the DAGOLDEN plugin bundle. The
    abstract should really be "Dist::Zilla configuration the way NGLENN,
    who does it the way DAGOLDEN does it, does it", but that was too long.
    I struggled with many complexities of writing a good dist.ini, but
    found that David Golden had solved all of them.

    I tweaked it slightly to fit my needs, most importantly to make
    everything work on Windows. I will probably continue to pull changes
    made to the originating DAGOLDEN distribution. See the changes file for
    more information.

USAGE

    To use this PluginBundle, just add it to your dist.ini. You can provide
    the following options:

    When running without git, GatherDir is used instead of Git::GatherDir.
    and all git check and commit operations are disabled.

    By default, versions are taken/rewritten in the source file using
    RewriteVersion and BumpVersionAfterRelease. If the auto_version option
    is true, the version is set by AutoVersion and munged with PkgVersion.
    For auto_version the generated cpanfile is copied to the repo on build;
    otherwise, Makefile.PL is copied.

    This PluginBundle now supports ConfigSlicer, so you can pass in options
    to the plugins used like this:

      [@NGLENN]
      Test::MinimumVersion.max_target_perl = 5.014
      ExecDir.dir = scripts

    This PluginBundle also supports PluginRemover, so dropping a plugin is
    as easy as this:

      [@NGLENN]
      -remove = Test::Portability
