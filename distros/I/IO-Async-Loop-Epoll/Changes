0.19    2018-06-25 17:07:14
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Handle post-fork() situations correctly (RT119835)

0.18    2018-01-21 23:59:10
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Account for recursive loop calls during signal handlers (RT124084)

0.17    2015/11/09 17:59:19
        [CHANGES]
         * Provide a more meaningful error message if the fd->filehandle
           mapping changes without the module being told

        [BUGFIXES]
         * Bugfix for Linux::Epoll API - functions return undef on error, not
           -1
         * Fix typo (RT88845)

0.16    BUGFIXES:
         * Remmeber to set zero timeout when there are fakeevents to use

0.15    BUGFIXES:
         * Add support for IO_ASYNC_WATCHDOG

0.14    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix for unwatch/rewatch IO case (RT78175)

0.13    CHANGES:
         * Rewrite to use Linux::Epoll instead, which has nicer scaling than
           IO::Epoll

0.12    BUGFIXES:
         * Only declare known support for on_hangup on Linux just on the
           offchance that some non-Linux OS ever gains epoll
         * Fix timing-related bugs by rounding epoll_pwait() timeout up to the
           next milisecond (RT73498)
         * on_hangup also needs to test for EPOLLERR condition

0.11    CHANGES:
         * Dynamically scale epoll_pwait() maxevents parameter to avoid
           stalling higher-numbered FDs during high load
         * Emulate non-epoll'able filehandles (e.g. regular files) as always
           read/write-ready

0.10    BUGFIXES:
         * Try to workaround perl blobk/unblock signals bug by using an unsafe
           POSIX::SigAction handler

0.09    CHANGES:
         * Updated API version for IO::Async 0.33

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Full example in SYNOPSIS section

        BUGFIXES:
         * Handle EPOLLERR as on_read_ready

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Updated for IO-Async 0.24
         * Use shared acceptance testing provided by IO::Async::LoopTests

0.06    CHANGES:
         * Various small updates to keep CPANTS happy

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Added 'use warnings'

        BUGFIXES:
         * Don't rely on writability of STDOUT during test scripts

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Updated for IO-Async 0.20

0.03    BUGFIXES:
         * Better handling of write-only Notifiers

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Use low-level IO::Epoll interface (epoll_ctl() etc..) instead of
           high-level IO::Poll-alike object wrapper. Should be better
           performance, and less buggy - doesn't depend on poor IO::Poll-like
           emulation details.

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
