Revision history for Net::Prober

0.17 - Sat Jul 15 11:14:44 Europe/Oslo 2017

    Removed tests using Opera Software hosts.
    Fixes #120113 and #122313.

0.15 - Mon Mar 21 17:02:00 Europe/Oslo 2016

    Fixed use of "scheme" and "port" arguments together in the same probe
      request. Request would be made with the default for "port" attribute
      (e.g. 80) even if scheme was set to "https" and port to 443.

0.14 - Fri Sep 26 10:00:00 Europe/Oslo 2014

    Fixed use of port number in Hostname header, as it was causing some HTTP
      probe requests to fail with Tata CDN endpoints.

0.12 - Mon Jan 13 11:27:00 Europe/Oslo 2014

    Fixed t/http.t tests failing due to a change in the remote website being
      tested (multiple cpan testers reports).

0.11 - Tue Jan  7 09:35:00 Europe/Oslo 2014

    Fixed t/tcp.t and t/port-names.t test failures on Windows platform:

0.10 - Mon Jan  6 17:05:00 Europe/Oslo 2014

    Added arbitrary HTTP method probing, with POST requests support,
      including request body and HTTP headers.

0.09 - Fri Nov 29 11:03:01 Europe/Oslo 2013

    Added "up_status_re" option (regular expression) to HTTP probe class,
      to allow custom regular expressions when matching against response HTTP
      status to determine good health. F.ex. this allows for 404 responses to
      be considered good health indicators (host up rather than down).

    Added a "reason" value in the HTTP probe results, so you can consult it to
      know why an HTTP probe failed. Note that this is only available for
      HTTP probes for now.

0.08 - Sat Mar  9 12:06:20 Europe/Oslo 2013

    Disabled log to syslog by default by popular demand.
      Seems a more sensible default.

0.07 - Mon Aug  6 15:50:55 Europe/Oslo 2012

    Net::Prober now requires perl 5.10.0, which was released in 2007.

    Fixed icmp probing on Win32 when user has no admin powers.
      Thanks to CPAN testers once again!

0.06 - Tue Jul 17 09:22:19 Europe/Oslo 2012

    Changed 'proto' to 'protocol' in the probe arguments (...)

    Changed default ping protocol when you don't have
      superuser privileges. tcp pings in most cases report
      hosts down incorrectly.

    IMAP probing through SSL doesn't work at the moment.

0.05 - Wed Oct 26 16:10:36 Europe/Oslo 2011

    Fixed a flapping test in t/http.t due to some changes
      in the tested website content.

0.04 - Sun Jul 31 09:49:44 Europe/Oslo 2011

    Fixed a port name conversion test failure on Solaris.
      Thanks to CPAN testers report by Jost Krieger:

0.03 - Sat May 21 09:39:01 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    Removed all '//' operator usage to make the
      module work on perl < 5.10

0.02 - Thu May 19 20:38:58 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    Make sure probe_http() returns "ok" as "0" or "1"
      and not blank. That happened for connection refused
      errors for example.

0.01 - Thu May 19 09:25:01 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    First CPAN release
