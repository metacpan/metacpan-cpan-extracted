Fixes https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=91861

Versions of Set::IntervalTree since 0.08 changed how it dealt with intervals,
so inserting or checking for the same value as a range started die()ing. As a
simple fix I just check for the version before doing operations on ranges so
Net::IPAddress::Filter works for both old and new versions of
Set::IntervalTree.

Plus updated tests for CIDR ranges, as I confused /24 and /32.

Now supports CIDR ranges. This adds a dependency on the pure perl module
Net::CIDR::Lite

New add_range_with_value() method to store a string with each range, plus
get_matches() method to list the strings of any overlapping ranges.

Initial release to CPAN. Working and mostly documented.
