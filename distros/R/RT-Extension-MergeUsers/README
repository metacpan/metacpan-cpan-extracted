NAME
    RT::Extension::MergeUsers - Merges two users into the same effective
    user

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension adds a "Merge Users" box to the User Administration
    page, which allows you to merge the user you are currently viewing with
    another user on your RT instance.

    It also adds "MergeInto" and "UnMerge" functions to the RT::User class,
    which allow you to programmatically accomplish the same thing from your
    code.

    It also provides a version of CanonicalizeEmailAddress, which means that
    all e-mail sent from secondary users is displayed as coming from the
    primary user.

INSTALLATION
    Be sure to also read "UPGRADING" if you are upgrading.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::MergeUsers');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::MergeUsers));

        or add RT::Extension::MergeUsers to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

UPGRADING
    If you are upgrading from 0.03_01 or earlier, you must run
    bin/rt-update-merged-users. This script will create MergedUsers
    Attributes so RT can know when you're looking at a user that other users
    have been merged into. If you don't run this script, you'll have issues
    unmerging users. It can be safely run multiple times, it will only
    create Attributes as needed.

UTILITIES
  rt-clean-merged-users
    When a user with another user merged into it is shredded, the attributes
    on that user are also shredded, but the merged user will remain, along
    with attributes that may point to the now missing user id. This script
    cleans up attributes if the merged-into user record is now gone. These
    users will then be converted back to regular unmerged users.

  rt-merge-users
    A command-line tool to merge one user into another

CAVEATS
  RT::Shredder and Merged Users
    Merging a user effectively makes it impossible to load the merged user
    directly. Attempting to access the old user resolves to the merged-into
    user. Because of this, MergeUsers has some extra code to help
    RT::Shredder clean up these merged records to avoid leaving merged user
    records in the DB while removing the user they were merged into.

    When running RT::Shredder on a user record with other users merged into
    it, the merged users are Unmerged before the initial user record is
    shredded. There are two options to handle these newly unmerged users:

    1.  Re-run your shredder command with the same or similar options. The
        unmerged user records will now be accessible and, depending on your
        shredder options, they will likely be shredded on the second run. If
        you have multiple layers of merged users, you may need to run
        shredder multiple times.

    2.  MergeUsers will log the unmerged users at the info level so you can
        pull the user ids from the log and shred them manually. This is most
        likely to be useful if you are shredding one specific user (and all
        merged accounts).
