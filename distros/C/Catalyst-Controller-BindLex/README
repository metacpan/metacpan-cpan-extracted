NAME
    Catalyst::Controller::BindLex - Stash your lexical goodness.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Moose;
        use base qw/Catalyst::Controller::BindLex/;

        sub bar : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            my $x : Stashed;
            my %y : Stashed;

            $x = 100;
        
            do_something( $c->stash->{x} ); # 100
    
            $c->forward( "gorch" );
        }

        sub gorch : Private {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
            my $x : Stashed;

            do_something( $x ); # still 100
        }

        sub counter : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
            my $count : Session;
            $c->res->body( "request number " . ++$count );
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin lets you put your lexicals on the stash and elsewhere very
    easily.

    It uses some funky modules to get its job done: PadWalker,
    Array::RefElem, Devel::Caller, Devel::LexAlias, and attributes. In some
    people's opinion this hurts this plugin's reputation ;-).

    If you use the same name for two variables with the same storage binding
    attribute they will be aliased to each other, so you can use this for
    reading as well as writing values across controller subs. This is almost
    like sharing your lexical scope.

WHY ISN'T THIS A PLUGIN?
    The way attributes are handled this can't be a plugin - the
    MODIFY_SCALAR_ATTRIBUTES methods and friends need to be in the class
    where the lexical is attributed, and this is typically a controller.

CONFIGURATION
    You can add attributes to the configaration by mapping attributes to
    handlers.

    Handlers are either strings of methods to be called on $c with no
    arguments, which are expected to return a hash reference (like "stash",
    "session", etc), or code references invoked with $c, a reference to the
    variable we're binding, and the name of the variable we're binding, also
    expected to return a hash reference.

DEFAULT ATTRIBUTES
    Some default attributes are pre-configured:

    Stash, Stashed
    Session, Sessioned
    Flash, Flashed
        Bind the variable to a key in "stash", "session", or "flash"
        respectively.

        The latter two require the use of a session; see
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session.
