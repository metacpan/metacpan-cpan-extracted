Version 0.001
=============

Initial release.

Version 0.002
=============

Factored much code into seperate classes, available seperately in
RFID::Base and RFID::EPC.  These changes should allow different
readers to be addressed with roughly the same interface, much like
accessing different databases with DBI drivers.


Version 0.003 (Wed Apr 26 13:14:23 EDT 2006)
============================================

Fix incorrect timeout units in reader modules.

alien.pl: Add -r "restart" option to automatically re-connect on error.
          Add -q "quiet" option to suppress all output except ISEE messages.
