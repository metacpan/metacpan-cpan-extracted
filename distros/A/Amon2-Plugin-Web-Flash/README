NAME

    Amon2::Plugin::Web::Flash - Ruby on Rails flash for Amon2

SYNOPSIS

       # In your Web.pm
       __PACKAGE__->load_plugins(
            'Web::Flash', # must be loaded *BEFORE* HTTP Session
            'Web::HTTPSession',
       );
    
       # In your controller
       $c->flash(success => 'ok'); # Set a data exposed in the next request
    
       # At the controller of the next request
       $c->flash('success') # You got 'ok'

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin provides a way to pass data between request. Anything
    placed in flash is exposed in the next request and then deleted.

    This is a clone of Ruby on Rails flash.

METHODS

 flash

       $c->flash(key => 'value'); # set
       $c->flash('key') # get
       my $hashref = $c->flash; # get all key-value pair

    The data you set can be retrieved during the processing of the next
    request.

 flash_now

       $c->flash_now(key => 'value');

    Unlike flash, the set data can be retrieved during the processing of
    the current request.

 flash_keep

       $c->flash_keep('key'); # keep the data of the specified key
       $c->flash_keep; # keeps all

    Keep either a specific flash data or all current flash data available
    for the next request.

 flash_discard

       $c->flash_discard('key');
       $c->flash_discard; # discard all

    Delete the flash data set in the current request.
