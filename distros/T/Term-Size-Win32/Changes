Revision history for Perl extension Term-Size-Win32.

0.209  Sun Aug 24 2008
       - no code change
       - this is for Win32 only - the tests should 
         never have succeeded for systems with no
         Win32::Console
       - now it faithfully installs only if there is a 
         working Win32::Console

0.208  Sat Aug 16 2008

0.206  Wed Sep 13 2006
        - no change - only regenerated META.yml

0.205  Sun May 21 2006
        - added t/00_use.t
        - added t/99_pod.t
        - Size.pm now lives in Term-Size distribution
          where it belongs

0.204  Sun May 20 2006
        - make test skips all tests if Win32::Console
          is not installed - this allows the distribution
          to be installed elsewhere, but it won't work
          if there is no working Win32::Console.
