NAME
    Types::Path::Tiny - Path::Tiny types and coercions for Moose and Moo

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
      ### specification of type constraint with coercion

      package Foo;

      use Moose;
      use Types::Path::Tiny qw/Path AbsPath/;

      has filename => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => Path,
        coerce => 1,
      );

      has directory => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => AbsPath,
        coerce => 1,
      );

      ### usage in code

      Foo->new( filename => 'foo.txt' ); # coerced to Path::Tiny
      Foo->new( directory => '.' ); # coerced to path('.')->absolute

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides Path::Tiny types for Moose, Moo, etc.

    It handles two important types of coercion:

    *   coercing objects with overloaded stringification

    *   coercing to absolute paths

    It also can check to ensure that files or directories exist.

SUBTYPES
    This module uses Type::Tiny to define the following subtypes.

  Path
    "Path" ensures an attribute is a Path::Tiny object. Strings and objects
    with overloaded stringification may be coerced.

  AbsPath
    "AbsPath" is a subtype of "Path" (above), but coerces to an absolute
    path.

  File, AbsFile
    These are just like "Path" and "AbsPath", except they check "-f" to
    ensure the file actually exists on the filesystem.

  Dir, AbsDir
    These are just like "Path" and "AbsPath", except they check "-d" to
    ensure the directory actually exists on the filesystem.

CAVEATS
  Path vs File vs Dir
    "Path" just ensures you have a Path::Tiny object.

    "File" and "Dir" check the filesystem. Don't use them unless that's
    really what you want.

  Usage with File::Temp
    Be careful if you pass in a File::Temp object. Because the argument is
    stringified during coercion into a Path::Tiny object, no reference to
    the original File::Temp argument is held. Be sure to hold an external
    reference to it to avoid immediate cleanup of the temporary file or
    directory at the end of the enclosing scope.

    A better approach is to use Path::Tiny's own "tempfile" or "tempdir"
    constructors, which hold the reference for you.

        Foo->new( filename => Path::Tiny->tempfile );
