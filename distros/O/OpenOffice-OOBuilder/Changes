       OOCBuilder
        - maximum number of supported sheets augmented to 64
        - bugfix in setdata: did only work on sheet 1, must
          work on active sheet
       OOBuilder
        - removed from encode sub
          $data=~ s/([^\x20-\x7F])/'&#' . ord($1) . ';'/gse; # from http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/faq/#encoding_conversion
          this was only needed for systems that did not support unicode
        - fixed bug in enocde_data : converting & must be done before all others

       OOBuilder: Windows now also supported: from now on using
                  Archive::Zip instead of the linux zip utility
                  with a system call. [thanks to Magnus Nufer]
         If you don't want to use Archive::Zip, and you are on a Linux
         system with access to a zip program, take a look at the
         OOBuilder.pm file, search for 'zip', and you will find some
         instructions how to change this.
         If you do so, please let me know. If enough people want this to be
         an option, I'll try to implement that in one of the next releases.
