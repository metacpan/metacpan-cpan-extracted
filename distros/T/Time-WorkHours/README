NAME
    Time::WorkHours - proportional shift DateTime to a work hours and few
    work hours routines

SYNOPSIS
        # our work hours is from 02:00 until 07:00
        my $wh = Time::WorkHours->new(
            work_interval_start => '02h',
            work_interval       => '5h',    # or 5*60
        );
    
        # shift given date to our work hours
        my $new_datetime = $wh->shift_to_work_time(DateTime->new(
            'hour'   => 14,
            'minute' => 32,
            # ... what ever month, year, day
        ));

DESCRIPTION
    Purpouse of this module is to equaly distribute tasks that are comming
    through the whole day into certain day interval.

    Or just move comming request to the start of work hours.

    For example imagine you want to process smoke tests only in the idle
    server hours - in the night. But the CPAN modules are comming through
    all day. You can note down the modules as they are comming and set the
    processing time to "$wh->shift_to_work_time()" so that it will not take
    the processing time when the server has to do it's "real" job.

PROPERTIES
        work_interval_start
        work_interval

METHODS
  new()
    Object constructor. Pass two mandatory arguments. "work_interval_start"
    and "work_interval".

    "work_interval_start" is the minute (or hour) when the work hours start.

    "work_interval" is how many minutes (or hours) does the work interval
    last.

    Both can be passed as a number in that case must represent minutes or as
    a string with numbers and 'h' at the end representing the value in
    hours.

    Example:

        $wh = Time::WorkHours->new(
            work_interval_start => '2h',  # or 120
            work_interval       => 180,   # or '3h'
        );

    Work interval starts at 02:00 and lasts for 3 hours.

  work_start($datetime)
    Return nearest DateTime when the work time starts. If inside the work
    interval then returns start datetime of this interval.

    If argument not passed the default is "DateTime->now".

  next_work_start($datetime)
    Same as work_start but will always return DateTime in the future.

  work_end($datetime)
    Returns nearest end of the work time.

    If argument not passed the default is "DateTime->now".

  within($datetime)
    Return true/false if the $datetime lies within work hours.

    If argument not passed the default is "DateTime->now".

  shift_to_work_time($date)
    Takes the $date and moves it to the neares work time interval. The shift
    is calculated proportionaly so that the time shifts are distributed in
    the work hour interval in the same order as they occure in 24h interval.

    Example:

        my $wh = Time::WorkHours->new(
            work_interval_start => '22h',
            work_interval       => '4h',
        );
        my $new_datetime = $wh->shift_to_work_time(DateTime->new(
            'day'    => 5,
            'hour'   => 14,
            'minute' => 00,
            # ... what ever month, year
        ));

    Will shift to next day to 00:00 as 14:00 is just in the middle of 02:00
    - (22:00) - 02:00 interval so it's shifted to the middle of 22:00 -
    02:00 work hours.

    If the DateTime will be at 01:59 (last minute of the work interval)
    there will be no shift.

    If the DateTime will be at 02:00 (first non work minute) the shift will
    be to 22:00.

    If argument not passed the default is "DateTime->now".

  work_interval_start_minute()
    Return number of minute in the day when the work interval starts.

  work_interval_minutes()
    Return for how many minutes does the work interval lasts.
