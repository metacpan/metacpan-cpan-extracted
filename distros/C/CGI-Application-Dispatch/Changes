Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::Dispatch.

3.12 September 10th, 2012
    [BUG FIXES]
    - Further fix diagnostic message in some cases when exceptions are thrown.  (Michael Lackhoff)

3.11 September 10th, 2012
    (No code changes) 

    [INTERNALS]
    -  Fixed test for rethrowing HTTP::Exception objects (Graham TerMarsch)

3.10 September 2nd, 2012
    [NEW FEATURES]
    - CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI now allows exceptions thrown as HTTP::Exception objects
      to bubble up in some cases. See the new documentation section on "Exception Handling"
      for details. (Mark Stosberg, Graham TerMarsch, RT#79022)  

    [BUG FIXES]
    - When auto_rest was enabled and no run mode was found, a 404 could have been returned
      instead of defaulting to start mode. We now correctly default to the start_mode().
      (James Q.L., Ron Savage, Mark Stosberg)

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    - Docs have been expanded to explain how /foo/:rm? resolves, and interaction
      with start_mode() when no run mode is found. (Mark Stosberg)

    [INTERNALS]
    - Fix diagnostic message in some cases when exceptions are thrown (Michael Lackhoff)
    - Added test coverage for auto_rest to CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI (Mark Stosberg) 
    - POD formatting fix in Dispatch.pm
    - Fix Perl 5.14 compatibility warning (chorny, RENEEB@cpan.org, SILASMONK@cpan.org)

3.06 September 9th, 2011
    Typo fix in "use" statement, introduced in 3.05 (Nicholas Bamber) 

3.05 September 5th, 2011
    Removed Exception::Class::TryCatch with the already required Try::Tiny thereby eliminating 
    one dependency. (Timothy Appnel)

    [INTERNALS]

    - cleaned up MANIFEST

3.00 Jun 16, 2011
    [FEATURES] 
    - PSGI support is improved. CGI::Application::Dispatch is now been
      rewritten and is included in this distribution. It is no longer a
      wrapper around the older dispatcher, but is completely PSGI-native.
      Performance should be improved a bit as well. 
     
    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    As part of the significant update to PSGI support, you'll need to update a
    couple lines of code in your "dispatch.cgi" script if you were using an
    older version of CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI. See the section on
    "Backwards Compatibility" in that documentation.

    [INTERNALS]
    - CGI::Application 4.5 is now required for the newer native PSGI support.

    - Exceptions in CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI are now handled with
      HTTP::Exception.  This in turn depends on HTTP::Status, which is
      currently in a distribution which depends on HTML::Parser, which depends
      having a C-compiler available. I don't consider this ideal, as I'd like
      to be able to support the easy installation of a pure-Perl
      CGI::Application stack. This could possibly be addressed in the future by
      removing the false dependency on a C-compiler from HTTP::Status, or we
      could return to use Exception::Class directly for exception handling.

      The except format of the default thrown exceptions may change in the
      future.

2.18 Sep 9, 2010
    - Update Build.PL to require a newer version of "version", to address
      a rare installation problem. (RT#56283) Thanks to Jim Brandt and others.

2.17 Dec 30, 2009

    - Update examples to use FindBin::Real instead of FindBin, since FindBin is not 
      fully mod_perl compatible. (Mark Stosberg)
    - Fix typo in POD (Alexander Becker) 

2.16 Mar 23, 2009
    - Fix: "$app->run() error handler breaks exception objects." RT#43340 (dekimsey)
    - Documentation improvements (Dave Baker, thinc)
    - remove "Makefile.PL", which appears to related to some test failures. Build.PL
      seems to work reliably. If removing Makefile.PL is a problem for you, maybe you have
      a better solution to RT#39793: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39793
      (Mark Stosberg)

2.15 Dec 4, 2008
    - Logging improvement: Quit duplicating $ENV{REQUEST_URI} for Not Found requests (Mark Stosberg)
    - Logging improvement: Remove stray "'" character (Mark Stosberg)

2.14 Nov 2, 2008
    - New feature: $ENV{PATH_INFO} is now abstracted through dispatch_path(). (RT#34069, Bradley Bailey) 
    - Attempted fix for "Couldn't open t/TEST.PL" error, RT#39793. Add comments to that ticket
      if you still have "make test" problems with Apache::Test. (Puneet Kishor, Kevin, Mark Stosberg) 
      http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39793
