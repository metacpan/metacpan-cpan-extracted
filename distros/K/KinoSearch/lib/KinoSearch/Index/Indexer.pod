=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::Indexer - Build inverted indexes.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $indexer = KinoSearch::Index::Indexer->new(
        schema => $schema,
        index  => '/path/to/index',
        create => 1,
    );
    while ( my ( $title, $content ) = each %source_docs ) {
        $indexer->add_doc({
            title   => $title,
            content => $content,
        });
    }
    $indexer->commit;



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Indexer class is KinoSearch's primary tool for managing the content of
inverted indexes, which may later be searched using
L<IndexSearcher|KinoSearch::Search::IndexSearcher>.

In general, only one Indexer at a time may write to an index safely.  If a
write lock cannot be secured, new() will throw an exception.

If an index is located on a shared volume, each writer application must
identify itself by supplying an
L<IndexManager|KinoSearch::Index::IndexManager> with a unique
C<< host >> id to Indexer's constructor or index corruption will
occur.  See L<KinoSearch::Docs::FileLocking> for a detailed discussion.

Note: at present, delete_by_term() and delete_by_query() only affect
documents which had been previously committed to the index -- and not any
documents added this indexing session but not yet committed.  This may
change in a future update.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new( I<[labeled params]> )

    my $indexer = KinoSearch::Index::Indexer->new(
        schema   => $schema,             # required at index creation
        index    => '/path/to/index',    # required
        create   => 1,                   # default: 0
        truncate => 1,                   # default: 0
        manager  => $manager             # default: created internally
    );

=over

=item *

B<schema> - A Schema.  Required when index is being created; if not supplied,
will be extracted from the index folder.

=item *

B<index> - Either a filepath to an index or a Folder.

=item *

B<create> - If true and the index directory does not exist, attempt to create
it.

=item *

B<truncate> - If true, proceed with the intention of discarding all previous
indexing data.  The old data will remain intact and visible until commit()
succeeds.

=item *

B<manager> - An IndexManager.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_doc(...)

    $indexer->add_doc($doc);
    $indexer->add_doc( { field_name => $field_value } );
    $indexer->add_doc(
        doc   => { field_name => $field_value },
        boost => 2.5,         # default: 1.0
    );

Add a document to the index.  Accepts either a single argument or labeled
params.

=over

=item *

B<doc> - Either a KinoSearch::Document::Doc object, or a hashref (which will
be attached to a KinoSearch::Document::Doc object internally).

=item *

B<boost> - A floating point weight which affects how this document scores.  

=back

=head2 add_index(index)

Absorb an existing index into this one.  The two indexes must
have matching Schemas.

=over

=item *

B<index> - Either an index path name or a Folder.

=back

=head2 optimize()

Optimize the index for search-time performance.  This may take a
while, as it can involve rewriting large amounts of data.

=head2 commit()

Commit any changes made to the index.  Until this is called, none of
the changes made during an indexing session are permanent.

Calling commit() invalidates the Indexer, so if you want to make more
changes you'll need a new one.

=head2 prepare_commit()

Perform the expensive setup for commit() in advance, so that commit()
completes quickly.  (If prepare_commit() is not called explicitly by
the user, commit() will call it internally.)

=head2 delete_by_term( I<[labeled params]> )

Mark documents which contain the supplied term as deleted, so that
they will be excluded from search results and eventually removed
altogether.  The change is not apparent to search apps until after
commit() succeeds.

=over

=item *

B<field> - The name of an indexed field. (If it is not spec'd as
C<< indexed >>, an error will occur.)

=item *

B<term> - The term which identifies docs to be marked as deleted.  If
C<< field >> is associated with an Analyzer, C<< term >>
will be processed automatically (so don't pre-process it yourself).

=back

=head2 delete_by_query(query)

Mark documents which match the supplied Query as deleted.

=over

=item *

B<query> - A L<Query|KinoSearch::Search::Query>.

=back



=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Index::Indexer isa L<KinoSearch::Object::Obj>.
