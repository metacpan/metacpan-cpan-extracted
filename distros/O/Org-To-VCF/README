     my $res = org_to_vcf(
         source_file   => 'addressbook.org', # or source_str
         #target_file  => 'addressbook.vcf', # defaults return the VCF in $res->[2]
         #include_tags => [...], # default exports all tags

DESCRIPTION
    Export contacts in Org document to VCF (vCard addressbook).

    My use case: I maintain my addressbook in an Org document
    "addressbook.org" which I regularly export to VCF and then import to
    Android phones.

    How contacts are found in an Org document: each contact is written in an
    Org headline (of whatever level) in a rather free-form format, e.g.:

     ** dad # [2014-01-25 Sat]  :remind_anniv:
     - fullname :: frasier crane
     - birthday :: [1900-01-02 ]
     - cell :: 0811 000 0001
     - some note
     *** TODO get dad's jakarta office number

    Todo items (headline with todo labels) are currently excluded.

    Contact fields are searched in list items. Currently Indonesian and
    English phrases are supported. If name field is not found, the title of
    the headline is used. I use timestamps a lot, so currently timestamps
    are stripped from headline titles.

    Perl-style comments (with "#" to the end of the line) are allowed.

    Org-contacts format is also supported, where fields are stored in a
    properties drawer:

     * Friends
     ** Dave Null
     :PROPERTIES:
     :EMAIL: dave@null.com
     :END:
     This is one of my friend.
     *** TODO Call him for the party

FUNCTIONS
  org_to_vcf
    Usage:

     org_to_vcf(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Export contacts in Org document to VCF (vCard addressbook).

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   default_country => *str*

        Specify default country code.

        Free-form phone numbers on phone fields are formatted by this
        function, e.g. "081 123 4567" becomes 0811234567. If default country
        is specified (e.g. "ID"), the number will be formatted as
        +62811234567. Setting this option is recommended so the phone
        numbers are nicely formatted as international number.

    *   exclude_tags => *array[str]*

        Exclude trees that carry one of these tags.

        If the whole document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole
        document will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of
        these tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the
        heading hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not
        the text below those headings.

        exclude_tags is evaluated after include_tags.

    *   export_notes => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to export note fields.

    *   include_tags => *array[str]*

        Include trees that carry one of these tags.

        Works like Org's 'org-export-select-tags' variable. If the whole
        document doesn't have any of these tags, then the whole document
        will be exported. Otherwise, trees that do not carry one of these
        tags will be excluded. If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading
        hierarchy above it will also be selected for export, but not the
        text below those headings.

    *   source_file => *str*

        Source Org file to export.

    *   source_str => *str*

        Alternatively you can specify Org string directly.

    *   target_file => *str*

        VCF file to write to.

        If not specified, VCF output string will be returned instead.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
