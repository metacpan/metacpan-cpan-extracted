NAME

    Alt::ExtUtils::PkgConfig::PLICEASE - Simplistic interface to pkgconf
    (like pkg-config)

VERSION

    version 1.15

SYNOPSIS

     env PERL_ALT_INSTALL=OVERWRITE cpanm Alt::ExtUtils::PkgConfig::PLICEASE

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides an alternative implementation of
    ExtUtils::PkgConfig which uses PkgConfig::LibPkgConf (itself using
    libpkgconf which is the C library interface to pkgconf) instead of
    pkg-config. It is unlikely to replace the original module, but is
    intended to gather reliability statistics for PkgConfig::LibPkgConf as
    compared with the original version and pkg-config.

    That being said, all effort has been made to make this module correct,
    and if you are in an environment where you have libpkgconf but not
    pkg-config, then this module may be of use to you. In order to get it
    to install you MUST set the environment variable PERL_ALT_INSTALL to
    OVERWRITE. For further rationale and details on this and other
    "Alternative" implementation modules see Alt.

    Here are some differences between my version and the original:

    no forking

      Because this implementation uses a library instead of a program to
      query the .pc file database, this version does not need to use fork
      or system.

    no AUTOLOAD

      This version doesn't use AUTOLOAD. As a result, dashed versions of
      the methods (cflags-only-I) are not supported. You must use the
      underscore methods (cflags_only_I). As the dashed versions were
      probably unintentional that is probably okay.
