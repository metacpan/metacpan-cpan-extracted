        - reworked initialization code so that a file can be sent in to replay
          past data and for testing on systems that don't have gpsd. (closes #4)
        - on() is now called by default in new() if in socket mode, and off() is
          likewise called in the destructor
        - new() now has a 'metric' option to convert to using imperial/standard
          measurements where applicable (closes #1)
        - added 'signed' option in new() to convert from signed lat/lon to alpha
          (eg: from -1.23 to 1.23S) (closes #3)
        - added direction(), converts from degree heading to compass direction
          (eg: NNE, SW etc) (closes #2)

        - first version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        - all current functionality has tests and documentation
        - new features will be added immediately (see issues), this is simply
          the first release to ensure all POD renders correctly on the CPAN
        - we dynaload JSON::XS, and if it fails, fall back to JSON::PP to avoid
          having to require non-core JSON in the Makefile.PL
