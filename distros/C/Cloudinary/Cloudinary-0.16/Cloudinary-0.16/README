    Cloudinary - Talk with cloudinary.com

VERSION
    0.15

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you interface to <http://cloudinary.com>.

SYNOPSIS
  Standalone
      my $delay = Mojo::IOLoop->delay;
      my $cloudinary = Cloudinary->new(cloud_name => "a", api_key => "b", api_secret => "c");

      $delay->begin;
      $cloudinary->upload({file => {file => $path_to_file}}, sub {
        my ($cloudinary, $res) = @_;
        # ...
        $delay->end;
      },
      });

      # let's you do multiple upload() in parallel
      # just call $delay->begin once pr upload()
      # and $delay->end in each callback given to upload()
      $delay->wait;

  Options
    As from 0.04 all methods support the short and long option, meaning the
    examples below work the same:

      $self->url_for('billclinton.jpg' => { w => 50 });
      $self->url_for('billclinton.jpg' => { width => 50 });

  url_for() examples
      $cloudinary->url_for('billclinton.jpg', { type => 'facebook' });
      $cloudinary->url_for('billclinton.jpg', { type => 'twitter_name', h => 70, w => 100 });
      $cloudinary->url_for('18913373.jpg', { type => 'twitter_name' });
      $cloudinary->url_for('my-uploaded-image.jpg', { h => 50, w => 50 });
      $cloudinary->url_for('myrawid', { resource_type => 'raw' });

  Aliases
    This module provides alias for the Cloudinary transformations:

      a = angle

      c = crop
      d = default_image
      e = effect
      f = fetch_format
      g = gravity
      h = height
      l = overlay
      p = prefix
      q = quality
      r = radius
      t = named_transformation
      w = width
      x = x

ATTRIBUTES
  cloud_name
    Your cloud name from <https://cloudinary.com/console>

  api_key
    Your API key from <https://cloudinary.com/console>

  api_secret
    Your API secret from <https://cloudinary.com/console>

  private_cdn

METHODS
  upload
      $self->upload(
        {
          file          => $binary_str | $url,    # required
          format        => $str,                  # optional
          public_id     => $str,                  # optional
          resource_type => $str,                  # image or raw. defaults to "image"
          tags          => ['foo', 'bar'],        # optional
          timestamp     => $epoch,                # time()
        },
        sub { my ($cloudinary, $res) = @_ }
      );

    Will upload a file to <http://cloudinary.com> using the parameters given
    "cloud_name", "api_key" and "api_secret". $res in the callback will be
    the json response from cloudinary:

      {
        url        => $str,
        secure_url => $str,
        public_id  => $str,
        version    => $str,
        width      => $int,    # only for images
        height     => $int,    # only for images
      }

    $res on error can be either "undef" if there was an issue
    connecting/communicating with cloudinary or a an error data structure:

      {error => {message: $str}}

    The "file" can be:

    *   A hash

          { file => 'path/to/image' }

    *   A Mojo::Upload object.

    *   A Mojo::Asset object.

    *   A URL

    "res" in callbacks will be the JSON response from
    <http://cloudinary.com> as a hash ref. It may also be "undef" if
    something went wrong with the actual HTTP POST.

    See also <https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images> and
    <http://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#raw_uploads>.

  destroy
      $self->destroy(
        {
          public_id     => $public_id,
          resource_type => $str,         # image or raw. defaults to "image"
        },
        sub { my ($cloudinary, $res) = @_; }
      );

    Will delete an image from cloudinary, identified by $public_id. The
    callback will be called when the image got deleted or if an error occur.

    On error, look for:

      {error => {message: $str}}

    See also
    <https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#deleting_images>.

  url_for
      $url_obj = $self->url_for("$public_id.$format", \%args);

    This method will return a public URL to the image at
    <http://cloudinary.com>. It will use "private_cdn" or the public CDN and
    "cloud_name" to construct the URL. The return value is a Mojo::URL
    object.

    Example %args:

      {
        h             => 150,      # height of image
        w             => 100,      # width of image
        resource_type => $str,     # image or raw. defaults to "image"
        secure        => $bool,    # use private_cdn or public cdn
        type          => $str,     # upload, facebook. defaults to "upload"
      }
