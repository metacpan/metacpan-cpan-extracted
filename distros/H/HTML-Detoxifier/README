NAME
	HTML::Detoxifier - practical module to strip harmful HTML

DESCRIPTION
	HTML::Detoxifier is a practical module to remove harmful tags from HTML
	input. It's intended to be used for web sites that accept user input in
	the form of HTML and then present that information in some form.

	Unlike other modules, HTML::Detoxifier is intended to be a practical
	solution that abstracts away all the specifics of whitelisting certain tags
	easily and securely. Tags are divided into functional groups, each of which
	can be disallowed or allowed as you wish. Additionally, HTML::Detoxifier
	knows how to clean inline CSS; with HTML::Detoxifier, you can securely
	allow users to use style sheets without allowing cross-site scripting
	vulnerabilities.

INSTALLATION
	The standard drill.

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES
	HTML::TokeParser
	HTML::Entities
	Exporter
