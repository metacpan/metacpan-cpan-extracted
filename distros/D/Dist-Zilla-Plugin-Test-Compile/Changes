2.057     2017-08-20 00:55:40Z
  - load optional modules in generated test in such a way that
    Perl::PrereqScanner doesn't think they are required dependencies
    (this is only significant on perl 5.7.2 and older)

2.056     2016-10-26 06:15:40Z
  - fix test failure on older perls

2.055     2016-10-24 01:39:56Z
  - verbose diagnostics can now be enabled in the test with
    the PERL_COMPILE_TEST_DEBUG environment variable.
  - added "switch" option, for passing additional command-line switches

2.054     2015-08-16 00:17:17Z
  - load blib as needed during tests, to check its $VERSION
  - use the :PerlExecFiles filefinder, when available (requires Dist::Zilla
    5.038)

2.053     2015-06-01 03:33:51Z
  - filter out "Using .../lib" warning emitted by older blib when checking for
    warnings (reported by preaction)

2.052     2015-03-28 06:09:55Z
 - always test for warnings if fail_on_warning=author and the generated test
   is in xt/author, without AUTHOR_TESTING having to be set

2.051     2014-10-18 01:51:02Z
 - fix needs_display tests failing on MSWin32 since 2.048

2.050     2014-10-15 23:57:04Z

   Test::More release

2.049     2014-10-14 04:46:44Z
 - use documented Test::Builder interface to examine test details

2.048     2014-10-11 21:54:16Z
 - make tests (and generated test) run when needs_display=1 and $DISPLAY is
   not set

 - avoid use of Test::More::explain in generated test when version is too old

2.046     2014-08-20 15:10:15Z
 - When warnings occur under fail_on_warning, diag them. (GH #9, Kent Fredric)

2.045     2014-08-07 04:25:14Z

2.043     2014-06-13 21:00:24Z
 - fix remaining failures on 5.10.0 (due to buggy -C flags) introduced in
   2.041

2.042     2014-06-04 02:28:25Z
 - fix test failures on older perls introduced in 2.041

2.041     2014-05-30 17:54:57Z

   extra whitespace, or comments (RT#95897)

2.040     2014-04-06 18:54:08Z
 - fix bad x_breaks metadata
 - line numbers in shipped code are now almost the same (within 3) as the
   repository source, for easier debugging

2.039     2013-12-02 05:23:01Z
 - fix bad handling of $stderr handle on win32 (from v2.038)

2.038     2013-11-29 18:20:37Z

 - now asserting minimum perl version required (5.6) in the generated test
 - new 'file' option, for adding extra files to be checked

2.037     2013-10-18 01:18:15Z

   Golden!)

2.034     2013-10-06 06:24:12Z

 - fixed incomplete prerequisite specification on Test::Warnings

2.033     2013-09-20 23:52:40Z
 - revert to IPC::Open3 implementation from v2.031 and earlier, but with
   waitpid ordering fixed so we never hang (thanks haarg!)
 - now bootstrapping ourselves so our own compile test is generated with the
   version of code we are shipping, rather than version N-1

2.032     2013-09-20 01:02:20Z
 - add missing prereq injection for File::Spec, when scripts are being tested
 - redo entire implementation, reverting from IPC::Open3 back to a capture{},
   using an inlined form of the guts of Capture::Tiny courtesy of David
   Golden, to address ongoing occasional hang issues on win32 (see RT#88783
   for the longer version)

2.031     2013-09-19 04:49:51Z
 - bypass cmd.exe on win32 to try to avoid occasional hang issue (RT#88783)

2.030     2013-09-11 05:01:26Z
 - depend on fixed Test::Warnings, where ':no_end_test' also covers the
   done_testing case (which turned out to be a red herring)

 - fix test failures for non-authors (oops)

2.028     2013-09-10 01:12:53Z
 - fix binmode issue on win32 (introduced in 2.026)
 - warnings tests bypassed during installation, to prevent installation issues
   in the presence of deprecation warnings from upstream dependencies (in this
   case, via Moose 2.1100)
 - new 'filename' option, for creating the compile test in a different
   location

2.027     2013-09-08 16:36:45Z
 - promise in documentation that the generated test requires no non-core
   modules, and is compatible with perl 5.6.2
 - re-release with properly encoded META.yml

2.026     2013-09-07 00:47:15Z
 - more fixes (hopefully the last) for script checking on win32

2.025     2013-09-04 01:32:34Z
 - more thoroughly test the generated test that no non-core modules are
   required, and syntax does not require a perl later than 5.8.8
 - fix use of regex syntax in script checking that required perl 5.9.5
 - properly screen out expected warnings from perl -c on older perls

2.024     2013-09-03 00:02:21Z
 - update warning regexp in test yet again, due to win32 failures (does not
   concern the generated test)

2.023     2013-08-30 01:27:54Z
 - now routing subprocesses' stdout to our stderr rather than throwing it
   away, for greater visibility into any side effects caused by loading
   modules
 - removed use of Test::Script entirely for testing scripts - now instead we
   call perl -c ourselves
 - we can now properly test scripts using special flags such as -T
 - now skipping non-perl scripts, by checking shebang lines
 - now any version of Test::More can be used (if the bail_out_on_fail option
   is not set)

2.022     2013-08-29 02:04:55Z
 - documentation fixes and cleanup
 - added missing test prereq on Test::Script (but still not injected into the
   built dist unless scripts are being shipped)
 - stop looking for newlines during install-time testing, to avoid needless
   failure on win32 (does not concern the generated test)

2.021     2013-08-27 00:59:49Z
 - fix incomplete prereq declaration on Test::Warnings
 - work around dubious install-time test failure on win32 with absolute
   filenames in tests (does not concern the generated test)

2.020     2013-08-24 18:06:49Z
 - fixed test prereq for Module::CoreList (thanks ambs!)
 - removed long-deprecated [CompileTests]

2.019     2013-08-24 04:09:07Z
 - now properly handling filenames with non-ascii characters
 - use IPC::Open3 for each subprocess, rather than Capture::Tiny; test added
   to confirm that no non-core prereqs are used (except sometimes
   Test::Script)

2.018     2013-08-04 02:25:37Z
 - delay inserting the list of modules to check until after all plugins have
   had an opportunity to add files (found via RT#87562)
 - fail_on_warning setting now also takes into consideration the results of
   script compilation checks

2.017     2013-08-03 18:06:44Z
 - fix conflicts metadata entry for Test::Kwalitee::Extra (I misinterpreted
   the metaspec as to what conflicts actually means!)

2.016     2013-08-02 18:48:44Z
 - convert Foo\Bar.pm to Foo/Bar.pm for proper %INC retrieval on win32
   (thanks, haarg!)

2.015     2013-08-02 18:22:28Z
 - fix double-quoting of file paths in require statement, introduced in v2.006
   (thanks, Peter Shangov!)

2.014     2013-08-01 02:37:00Z
 - fix install tests on win32, broken since 2.011 (RT#84781)
 - properly munge filenames on win32 (broken since 2.013)

2.013     2013-07-30 19:54:52Z
 - .pm files are tested with -Mblib again; 2.012 was a mistake.
 - now require()ing files without the leading lib/, to avoid potentially
   loading files twice (a problem since 2.009) - thanks dolmen and haarg!

2.012     2013-07-30 19:12:53Z
 - .pm files are once again tested with -Ilib, instead of -Mblib, to avoid
   potentially loading files twice (this was changed in 2.009).

2.011     2013-07-28 22:45:53Z
 - .pod files are now always omitted from the list of found modules in the
   dist (thanks for the report, Alberto Simões!)

2.010     2013-07-27 00:45:51Z
 - add conflicts metadata for Test::Kwalitee::Extra, which does not like the
   require() syntax we use
 - all changes since 2.002 now as a stable release:

   [FEATURES]
   - new fail_on_warning option
   - the 'skip' option can now be provided multiple times
   - calculate the list of files to check at build time, rather than using
     File::Find at runtime; the filefinders used are configurable.

   - include a comment in the generated test indicating how it was generated
   - modules used by the test are injected as test requires dependencies.
   - avoid trying to load Test::Script if there are no scripts to check
   - we now load the .pm file, rather than attempting to calculate the module
     name and then loading that
   - if there are scripts to be tested, Test::Script is now mandatory;
     accurate prerequisites are injected into the dist in all cases
   - properly inject all used modules as test prerequisites
   - now using Text::Template to generate the test, for simpler munging code
