=head1 NAME

grepurl - print links in HTML
=encoding utf8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	grepurl [-bdv] [-e extension[,extension] [-E extension[,extension]
		[-h host[,host]] [-H host[,host]] [-p regex] [-P regex]
		[-s scheme[,scheme]] [-s scheme[,scheme]] [-u URL]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the script interface to L<App::grepurl> which is a modulino.

The grepurl program searches through the URL specified in the -u
switch and prints the URLs that satisfies the given set of options.
It applies the options roughly in order of which part of the URL
the option affects (scheme, host, path, extension).

So far, grepurl expects to search through HTML, although I want to
add other content types, especially plain text, RSS feeds, and so on.
