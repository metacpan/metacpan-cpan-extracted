Devel::Modlist - Show the modules, with version number, used by a script

Version: 0.801 (see ChangeLog for full history)

WHAT IS IT

Devel::Modlist is a small tool that emits a list of files that were brought
into a script via 'require' or 'use'. It lists these to the STDOUT descriptor
at the end of the script's run. Each file is converted to class-like name,
e.g. IO/File.pm is displayed as IO::File, and the version number, if found,
is displayed. Files ending in .al (auto-loading routines) and .ix (indices
for auto-loading) are ignored. Optionally, one can request that files in
the Perl core library area not be listed (see the manual page).


USING Devel::Modlist

The module is designed to be used like most Devel::* packages:

        perl -d:Modlist script

It can also be used via -M:

        perl -MDevel::Modlist script


BUILDING/INSTALLING

The package is designed to configure and build like a typical Perl module.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

(at present, there are no tests defined for Devel::Modlist)

To install:

        make install

You may need super-user priviledges to install.
