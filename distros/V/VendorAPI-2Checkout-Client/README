VendorAPI-2Checkout-Client

This module is only useful to you if you have a vendor account at 2Checkout.com.
In order to test your ability to interact with the 2checkout Vendor API, you'll 
need to pass your vendor API username and password to 'make test' via environment
variables, so the test can use them when calling new().

If the preceeding paragraph does not make any sense to you, then this module
just might not be for you.

The two environment variables are:
  VAPI_2CO_UID=myapiuserid 
  VAPI_2CO_PWD=myapiuserpassword 

If you don't have a vendor account, or have not set up an API user yet, don't set the 
variables, and we'll skip the tests.

You may need to log into your 2checkout account and create a new user for API access. You can't
use your regular Vendor Area login for API access, as API access and Vendor Area 
are mutually exclusive.

This module uses Params::Validate which likes to die if the parameters do not pass validation, 
so wrap your calls in evals, etc.

If you have sales, set VAPI_HAS_SALES=1 - if you have none, unset it, or don't set it. 
If you have coupons, set VAPI_HAS_COUPONS=1 - if you have none, unset it, or don't set it. 
If you have payments, set VAPI_HAS_PAYMENTS=1 - if you have none, unset it, or don't set it. 
If you have products, set VAPI_HAS_PRODUCTS=1 - if you have none, unset it, or don't set it. 
If you have options, set VAPI_HAS_OPTIONS=1 - if you have none, unset it, or don't set it.
