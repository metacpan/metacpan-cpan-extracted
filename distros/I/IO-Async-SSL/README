DESCRIPTION

    This module extends existing IO::Async classes with extra methods to
    allow the use of SSL or TLS-based connections using IO::Socket::SSL. It
    does not directly provide any methods or functions of its own.

    Primarily, it provides SSL_connect and SSL_listen, which yield
    IO::Socket::SSL-upgraded socket handles or IO::Async::Stream instances,
    and two forms of SSL_upgrade to upgrade an existing TCP connection to
    use SSL.

    As an additional convenience, if the SSL_verify_mode and SSL_ca_*
    options are omitted, the module will attempt to provide them by quering
    the result of IO::Socket::SSL's default_ca function. Otherwise, the
    module will print a warning and set SSL_VERIFY_NONE instead.

LOOP METHODS

    The following extra methods are added to IO::Async::Loop.

 SSL_upgrade

       ( $stream or $socket ) = $loop->SSL_upgrade( %params )->get;

    This method upgrades a given stream filehandle into an SSL-wrapped
    stream, returning a future which will yield the given stream object or
    socket.

    Takes the following parameters:

    handle => IO::Async::Stream | IO

      The IO::Async::Stream object containing the IO handle of an
      already-established connection to act as the transport for SSL; or
      the plain IO socket handle itself.

      If an IO::Async::Stream is passed it will have the reader and writer
      functions set on it suitable for SSL use, and will be returned as the
      result from the future.

      If a plain socket handle is passed, that will be returned from the
      future instead.

    SSL_server => BOOL

      If true, indicates this is the server side of the connection.

    In addition, any parameter whose name starts SSL_ will be passed to the
    IO::Socket::SSL constructor.

    The following legacy callback arguments are also supported, in case the
    returned future is not used:

    on_upgraded => CODE

      A continuation that is invoked when the socket has been successfully
      upgraded to SSL. It will be passed an instance of an IO::Socket::SSL,
      which will have appropriate SSL-compatible reader/writer functions
      attached.

       $on_upgraded->( $sslsocket )

    on_error => CODE

      A continuation that is invoked if IO::Socket::SSL detects an error
      while negotiating the upgrade.

       $on_error->( $! )

 SSL_connect

       $stream = $loop->SSL_connect( %params )->get;

    This method performs a non-blocking connection to a given address or
    set of addresses, upgrades the socket to SSL, then yields a
    IO::Async::Stream object when the SSL handshake is complete.

    It takes all the same arguments as IO::Async::Loop::connect(). Any
    argument whose name starts SSL_ will be passed on to the
    IO::Socket::SSL constructor rather than the Loop's connect method. It
    is not required to pass the socktype option, as SSL implies this will
    be stream.

    This method can also upgrade an existing IO::Async::Stream or subclass
    instance given as the handle argument, by setting the reader and writer
    functions.

 SSL_connect (void)

       $loop->SSL_connect( %params,
          on_connected => sub { ... },
          on_stream => sub { ... },
       );

    When not returning a future, this method also supports the on_connected
    and on_stream continuations.

    In addition, the following arguments are then required:

    on_ssl_error => CODE

      A continuation that is invoked if IO::Socket::SSL detects an
      SSL-based error once the actual stream socket is connected.

    If the on_connected continuation is used, the socket handle it yields
    will be a IO::Socket::SSL, which must be wrapped in
    IO::Async::SSLStream to be used by IO::Async. The on_stream
    continuation will already yield such an instance.

 SSL_listen

       $loop->SSL_listen( %params )->get;

    This method sets up a listening socket using the addresses given, and
    will invoke the callback each time a new connection is accepted on the
    socket and the SSL handshake has been completed. This can be either the
    on_accept or on_stream continuation; on_socket is not supported.

    It takes all the same arguments as IO::Async::Loop::listen(). Any
    argument whose name starts SSL_ will be passed on to the
    IO::Socket::SSL constructor rather than the Loop's listen method. It is
    not required to pass the socktype option, as SSL implies this will be
    stream.

    In addition, the following arguments are rquired:

    on_ssl_error => CODE

      A continuation that is invoked if IO::Socket::SSL detects an
      SSL-based error once the actual stream socket is connected.

    The underlying IO::Socket::SSL socket will also require the server key
    and certificate for a server-mode socket. See its documentation for
    more details.

    If the on_accept continuation is used, the socket handle it yields will
    be a IO::Socket::SSL, which must be wrapped in IO::Async::SSLStream to
    be used by IO::Async. The on_stream continuation will already yield
    such an instance.

STREAM PROTOCOL METHODS

    The following extra methods are added to IO::Async::Protocol::Stream.

 SSL_upgrade

       $protocol->SSL_upgrade( %params )->get;

    A shortcut to calling $loop->SSL_upgrade. This method will unconfigure
    the transport of the Protocol, upgrade its underlying filehandle to
    SSL, then reconfigure it again with SSL reader and writer functions on
    it. It takes the same arguments as $loop->SSL_upgrade, except that the
    handle argument is not required as it's taken from the Protocol's
    transport.
