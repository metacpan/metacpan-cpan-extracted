Revision history for Perl extension Sub::Signatures.

0.21  2005-12-03
      - Switched from FILTER_ONLY to FILTER due to issues with
        Text:::Balanced.  Ultimately, this leads to more robust code (and
        slightly faster, too).
      - Allow private subs and methods to be "signified"
      - Fixed odd corner case where "substr" could confused filter if used
        with parens and embedded in an "if" statement.  Thanks to Jerry
        Sievert for the report.
      - Eliminated useless INIT block.

0.20  2005-10-06
      - Added Pod Tests
      - Converted to Module::Build
      - Removed broken "strict" mode
      - Added "fallback" method/subroutines
      - Thorough documentation update

0.11  Mon Dec 6, 2004
      - whoops!  Fixed serious bug where we did not allow classnames
        signatures to have colons.
      - improved debugging code.

0.1   Sun Dec 5, 2004
      - Updated the docs.
      - Made anonymous functions work.
      - Dies if you try to define a sub with a duplicate signature
