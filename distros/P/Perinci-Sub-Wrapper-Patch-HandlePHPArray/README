NAME
    Perinci::Sub::Wrapper::Patch::HandlePHPArray - Convert {} to [] or vice
    versa to match functions' expectations

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of
    Perinci::Sub::Wrapper::Patch::HandlePHPArray (from Perl distribution
    Perinci-Sub-Wrapper-Patch-HandlePHPArray), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
     use Perinci::Sub::Wrapper::HandlePHPArray;

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches Perinci::Sub::Wrapper so the generated function
    wrapper code can convert argument "{}" to "[]" when function expects
    argument to be an array, or vice versa "[]" to "{}" when function
    expects a hash argument. This can help if function is being called by
    PHP clients, because in PHP "Array()" is ambiguous, it can be an empty
    hash or an empty array.

    To make this work, you have to specify schema in your argument
    specification in your Rinci metadata, and the type must be hash or
    array.

    This is a temporary/stop-gap solution. The more "official" solution is
    to use Perinci::Access::HTTP::Server which has the
    "deconfuse_php_clients" option (by default turned on).
