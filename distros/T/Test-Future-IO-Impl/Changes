Revision history for Test-Future-IO-Impl

0.16    2026-01-07
        [BUGFIXES]
         * Be less sensitive to `->send` failure in peer-closed case, as OS
           behaviour differs here
         * sleep() unconditionally after closing listening server in connect
           test, as most OSes need it. 100msec is sufficient
