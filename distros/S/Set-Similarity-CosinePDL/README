NAME

    Set::Similarity::CosinePDL - Cosine similarity for sets PDL
    implementation

SYNOPSIS

     use Set::Similarity::CosinePDL;
    
     # object method
     my $cosine = Set::Similarity::CosinePDL->new;
     my $similarity = $cosine->similarity('Photographer','Fotograf');

DESCRIPTION

 Cosine similarity

    A intersection B / (sqrt(A) * sqrt(B))

METHODS

    Set::Similarity::CosinePDL inherits all methods from Set::Similarity
    and implements the following new ones.

 from_sets

      my $similarity = $object->from_sets(['a'],['b']);

    This method expects two arrayrefs of strings as parameters. The
    parameters are not checked, thus can lead to funny results or uncatched
    divisions by zero.

    If you want to use this method directly, you should take care that the
    elements are unique. Also you should catch the situation where one of
    the arrayrefs is empty (similarity is 0), or both are empty (similarity
    is 1).
