Revision history for Perl module 'again'

0.08 2014-09-27 NEILB
    - If you had use'd a module the regular way ("use <module>"),
      then reloaded it with "use again <Module>", you'd get a warning
      about an uninitialized value. RT#97789

0.07 2014-08-16 NEILB
    - Improved the abstract (NAME section in pod)
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla
    - Minor improvements to DESCRIPTION, particularly first paragraph.
    - Tweaked the SEE ALSO; removed the bit saying Module::Reload seems
      abandoned, since I've now adopted it as well.
