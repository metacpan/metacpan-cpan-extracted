NAME
     Net::SnoopLog - Read snoop network packet logs, from RFC1761
     snoop ver 2. Perl implementation (not an interface).


SYNOPSIS
     use Net::SnoopLog;

     $log = Net::SnoopLog->new(); 
     $log->read("/tmp/out01");

     @Indexes = $log->indexes;

     foreach $index (@Indexes) {
          ($length_orig,$length_incl,$drops,$secs,$msecs) =
                                      $log->header($index);
          $data = $log->data($index);

          # your code here
     }

DESCRIPTION
     This module can read the data and headers from snoop ver 2
     logs (those that obey RFC1761 - try "man snoop").

METHODS
     new ()
         Constructor, return a SnoopLog object.

     read (FILENAME)
         Read the snoop file indicated into memory.

     indexes ()
         Return an array of index numbers for the packet loaded
         from the snoop file. The indexes start at 0.

     maxindex ()
         Return the number of the last index. More memory
         efficient than indexes(). Add 1 to get the packet count.
         The indexes start at 0.

     header (INDEX)
         Takes an integer index number and returns the packet
         header. This is:
            Length of original packet,
            Length actually included in the snoop log,
            Cumulative drops (since the snoop log began),
            Packet arrival time as seconds since Jan 1st 1970,
            Microseconds

     data (INDEX)
         Takes an integer index number and returns the raw packet
         data. (This is usually Ethernet/IP/TCP data).

     version ()
         Returns a string containing the numeric snoop log
         version, which is expected to be "2".

     datalink ()
         Returns a strings containing the numeric datalink type,
         see RFC 1761 for a table of these. (4 is Ethernet).


INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

DEPENDENCIES
     ExtUtils::MakeMaker

EXAMPLES
     Once you can read the raw packet data, the next step is read
     through the protocol stack. An Ethernet/802.3 example is,

     ($ether_dest,$ether_src,$ether_type,$ether_data) =
      unpack('H12H12H4a*',$data);

     Keep an eye on CPAN for Ethernet, IP and TCP modules. 

LIMITATIONS
     This reads snoop version 2 logs (the most common). There
     could be a new version in the distant future with a move to
     64-bit timestamps - at which point this module will need
     updating.

TODO
     Future versions should include the ability to write as well
     as read snoop logs. Also a memory efficient technique to
     process very large snoop logs (where the log size is greater
     than available virtual memory).
