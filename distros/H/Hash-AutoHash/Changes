Revision history for Hash-AutoHash

1.17	2013-10-05
	No functional changes
	Updated depdendencies
        Fixed boilerplate & pod tests

1.16	2012-12-11
	Fixed more deprecated syntax: defined @array deprecated in 5.16 or so
	Fixed tests that were failing because of hash key randomization 
	introduced in 5.16

1.15	2012-09-18
	Changed version number in helper package for consistency with other
	AutoHash modules

1.14	2012-09-02
	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: no longer possible to use method notation for keys
   	with the same names as methods inherited from UNIVERSAL (the base class 
	of everything). These are  'can', 'isa', 'DOES', and 'VERSION'. The 
	reason is that as of Perl 5.9.3, calling UNIVERSAL methods as functions 
	is deprecated and developers are encouraged to use method form instead. 
	Previous versions of AutoHash are incompatible with CPAN modules that
	adopt this style.

1.13	2012-09-01
	Added test for version number in POD
	Changed tests to correct errors found by CPAN testers that look like
	'deprecated use of qw(...) as parentheses' although the actual error
	message is 'Global symbol "$test" requires explicit package name'
	Changes to Build.PL
	- Removed redundant 'dist_version_from' param
        - Added Module::Build to configure_requires
	- Changed create_makefile_pl from deprecated 'passthrough' to 'small'

1.12    2010-03-01
	Added perl 5.8.3 as prerequisite. needed by autohash_empty and 
	autohash_notempty when operating on a tied hash. these functions test
	for emptiness by referencing the hash in scalar context. this doesn't
	work in perls prior to 5.8.3. thanks to CPAN smoke testers for finding
	this!

1.11    2010-02-23
	Minor documentation cleanup and reformatting

1.10    2009-10-30
	This should be stable release assuming CPAN testers find no problems
        Refactored perl 5.10 dependent test code
	Reversed order of revisions in this file
	
1.02	2009-10-29
	Documentation changes only. 
	- Changed module names AVP_Single, AVP_Multi to AVPairsSingle, AVPairsMulti
          in SEE ALSO to better match CPAN naming style

1.01	2009-10-28
	Fixed 'make test' - bug found by CPAN testers
	Fixed version number failure in tests on perl 5.10 - bug found by CPAN 
	testers
	Added DOES to special methods delegated to base class. Needed for 
	perl 5.10, which added DOES to methods inherited from UNIVERSAL

1.00    2009-10-26
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
