=head1 DESCRIPTION

smokeinabox is a standalone boxed CPAN Tester smoke environment. Built on L<CPANPLUS>
and L<CPANPLUS::YACSmoke> it enables an individual to simply download this distribution, extract it
somewhere, add their email address and optionally an email gateway to use and start CPAN Testing
against an arbitary C<perl> executable without worrying about the toolchain dependencies.

It provides L<CPANPLUS> and bundled modules required to bootstrap the CPAN Testing process.

Included are:

  CPANPLUS + its prereqs

  CPANPLUS::YACSmoke

  YAML::Tiny

  Test::Reporter

  Sort::Versions

  Regexp::Assemble

  Config::IniFiles
