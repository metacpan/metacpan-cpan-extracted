* Make JavaServer into an Applet - I don't think this would be too hard to do.
* Maybe figure out a more generic way to implement event handling.
* Allow classes to reside on the front-end side of the world & be loaded
	back when requested.
* Was playing with allowing Perl to subclass Java classes but the implementation
	was getting too hairy so need to rethink it.
* Maybe use a multiplexed stream between client & JavaServer so I don't have to
	use to separate ports.
* Allow for other communication means between client & JavaServer - like
	named pipes or UNIX domain socket for local communications & maybe
	UDP &/or multicast.  That should not be too hard.
* See what's going on w/Beans & maybe allow Beans to be written in Perl.
* Allow for persistent object storage
* Allow multiple clients to hook into same JavaServer to share objects
	(rite now a new Thread is spawned for each connexion & they don't
	talk to each other).
* Maybe 'use overload' for equality check
* Fix stupid bug that doesn't allow a Java string to be an integer.
* Would be nice to make Java arrays tie'd Perl arrays.  Should't be very hard.

* Created primitive arrays!

* Am working on a C frontend - basically a glorified JNI.
* Would be nice to get handles to objects created by yer Java program 
	so the client side of JavaServer can play with them.

* DID 'use overload' for equality check!
* DID tie Java arrays to Perl arrays!
*	Cross 'em off!
