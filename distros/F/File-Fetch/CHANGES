0.19_01     Mon Feb  9 18:04:01 2009

* Address: #42268: Wishlist: slurp to scalar
  File::Fetch can now fetch to scalars as well

0.18        Wed Dec 17 14:00:40 2008

* Address #41412: User agent string contains uninterpolated 
  $VERSION.
* Use IPC::Cmd 0.42's supplied QUOTE constant, rather than 
  rolling our own

0.16        Fri Oct 10 13:54:40 2008

* Promote 0.15_04 to stable.

0.15_04     Mon Sep 22 15:08:49 2008

* Address: #37649: Feature request: Support lftp
  File::Fetch now supports lftp, with one minor caveat: it uses
  a temporary file to store the commands for lftp, as they are
  multiline commands. Without this, we run into portability issues
  with 'special' characters on various platforms, like ; and &.
  
0.15_03     Sun Jul 13 15:56:41 2008

* Add -q to curl, to inhibit the reading of .curlrc, 
  which may interfere with the options we pass ourselves.

0.15_02     Sun May 18 13:42:30 2008

* Address #35018: Treat HTTP 404 Message as fail with lynx
  lynx now does a -head request first to make sure the file
  exists before proceeding

0.15_01     Sun Apr  6 13:55:36 2008

* Address: #32755: File-Fetch tests cannot fail if 
  unable to connect to internet. Tests are now skipped
  if it looks as the failure is due to a lacking network
  connection.
* New IPC::Cmd (0.41) fixes an IPC::Open3 bug, which we
  now rely on.

0.14        Fri Dec 14 13:42:30 2007

* Promote 0.13_04 to stable.

0.13_04     Wed Nov 14 20:07:02 2007

* VMS patches for file:// uris by John M.

0.13_03         2007-11-04 21:32:40

* Restore OS specific file:// URI behaviour. The 
  RFC's specify that the url definition is host OS
  specific, so what a url means on one machine will
  mean something different on another.
  VMS is now treated according to RFC 1738 
  (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738).

0.13_02 Sun Nov  4 10:38:40 CET 2007

* Apply a perl 5.5.x compatibility fix. Users with
  perl 5.6.0 or higher do not need to upgrade.

0.13_01 Sat Nov  3 18:55:10 CET 2007

* Apply a modified version of dmq's patch to deal
  properly with file:// URIs on Win32. 
* Add test cases for Win32 file:// URIs

0.12    Mon Oct 15 14:32:23 CEST 2007

* Treat VMS like UNIX when dealing with file URIs

0.10    Fri Jan 26 13:51:19 CET 2007

* Promote 0.09_02 to stable.

0.09_02 Sun Jan  7 18:44:09 CET 2007

* The quotation as done in 0.09_01 doesn't play
  nicely with Win32 and IPC::Run. IPC::Run is
  therefor disabled during the fetch() call.
* Remove File::Fetch::Item as a class. All objects
  are now plain File::Fetch objects. This has no
  impact on user-end code, except code that checks
  the class of objects.
* URI encoding is not always clear or trivial. Add
  a FAQ entry about it.
* Add $ff->output_file as accessor, which is the 
  requested file, stripped from query parameters.
* Errors are now stored per object rather than 
  class wide.

0.09_01 Wed Jan  3 17:17:31 CET 2007

* address: #23864: File:Fetch does not use quotation 
    marks while using wget:
  * the handlers for lynx, wget, curl and rsync now
    quote their URIs.

0.08    Wed Jul  5 13:56:36 CEST 2006

* address: #18942: unproper handling of http errors 
  in external handlers:
  * the wget handler, on a failed attempt, now 
    unlinks its outputfile
  * the curl handler is updated to follow '302 moved' 
    and such like status messages
  * lynx use is further discouraged, as it doesn't 
    communicate http status messages back to the caller 
    at all.
* address #11483: File::Fetch 0.07 cannot do an FTP 
  fetch on Win32. FTP fetching using Net::FTP should
  now work properly on win32.
* update test suite so it runs safely under PERL_CORE

0.07    Thu Dec 23 09:31:00 PST 2004
