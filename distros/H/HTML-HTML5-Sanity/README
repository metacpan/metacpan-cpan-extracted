NAME
    HTML::HTML5::Sanity - make HTML5 DOM trees less insane

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::HTML5::Parser;
      use HTML::HTML5::Sanity;
  
      my $parser    = HTML::HTML5::Parser->new;
      my $html5_dom = $parser->parse_file('http://example.com/');
      my $sane_dom  = fix_document($html5_dom);

DESCRIPTION
    The Document Object Model (DOM) generated by HTML::HTML5::Parser meets the
    requirements of the HTML5 spec, but will probably catch a lot of people by
    surprise.

    The main oddity is that elements and attributes which appear to be
    namespaced are not really. For example, the following element:

      <div xml:lang="fr">...</div>

    Looks like it should be parsed so that it has an attribute "lang" in the
    XML namespace. Not so. It will really be parsed as having the attribute
    "xml:lang" in the null namespace.

    `fix_document($document)`
          $sane_dom = fix_document($html5_dom);

        Returns a modified copy of the DOM and leaving the original DOM
        unmodified.

    `fix_element($element_node, $new_document_node, \%namespaces)`
        Don't use this. Not exported.

    `fix_attribute($attribute_node, $new_element_node, \%namespaces)`
        Don't use this. Not exported.

    $HTML::HTML5::Sanity::FIX_LANG_ATTRIBUTES
          $HTML::HTML5::Sanity::FIX_LANG_ATTRIBUTES = 2;
          $sane_dom = fix_document($html5_dom);

        If set to 1 (the default), the package will detect invalid values in
        @lang and @xml:lang, and remove the attribute if it is invalid. If set
        to 2, it will also attempt to canonicalise the value (e.g. 'EN_GB'
        will be converted to to 'en-GB'). If set to 0, then the value of
        language attributes is not checked.
