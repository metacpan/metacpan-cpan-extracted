Revision history for Perl extension SVG::Grid.

1.12  2018-01-28T11:18:00
	- Switch from opening my own file handle to writing with File::Slurper. This is to address
		failure reports from CPAN testers on MS Win machines.
	- Fix minor typo in t/test.t.

1.11  2017-12-21T11:11:00
	- Use File::Slurper's read_binary() for testing rather than its read_text(). This should help
		with the test failures under MS Windows.

1.10  2017-12-19T09:52:00
	- Testing using the new SVG 2.82. All ok. So edit data/synopsis.svg to fiddle whitespace, and
		retest. All ok. Thanx to Mohammad S Anwar for the work on SVG.
	- Update pre-req of SVG from 2.64 to 2.82.

1.09  2017-12-18T15:40:00
	- Rework code in t/test.t which cleans up SVGs in preparation for comparing them.

1.08  2017-12-15T13:52:00
	- Replace the $options{target} parameter to image_link() with $options{show}. Likewise for
		rectangle_link() and text_link(). Fix and expand docs to match.

1.07  2019-09-09T23:59:59
	- Change heading from Copyright to Copyright and Licence.

1.06  2017-08-15T08:39:00
	- Patch scripts/generate.images.sh to remove the call to cell.sh. The latter file was deleted
		some time ago. Thanx to Kevin Mulholland for noticing.

1.05  2017-08-11T17:10:05
	- Add 'title' to the hash of options you can pass to image_link(), rectangle_line() and
		text_link(). Note: This module uses keys named 'target' and 'title'. It passes these to the
		SVG module as '-target' and '-title'.
	- Update the docs to include 'title'.
	- Update the FAQ to discuss Unicode and MouseOver. The latter is triggered by using 'title'.
 	- Chane the write() method to encode the output file as UTF-8. Then add 'use utf8' to
		synopsis.pl and test.t.
	- Update various demos to show the usage of 'title'.

1.04  2017-04-22T11:52:00
	- Patch t/test.t so that before comparing shipped SVG with generated one, zap within those
		2 files the versions #s of the SVG modules which created the files. This is necessary
		because I generated data/synopsis.svg with SVG V 2.64, but any version might be
		installed on another machine. See #RT212178. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for the report.

1.03  2016-08-14T11:33:00
	- Stop using Test::Stream. Use Test::More shipped in the Test::Simple distro.
		See RT#116932. Thanx to Chad Granum.
	- Update version #s in pre-reqs.
	- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
	- Update .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.
	- Move File::Spec, File::Temp, Test::Pod and Test::Simple to TEST_REQUIRES within Makefile.PL.
	- Change licence from Artistic to Perl.

1.02  2016-03-21T13:44:00
	- Patch image_link() to return the auto-generated id of the image element. Likewise,
		rectangle_link() returns the id of the rectangle element and text_link() returns the id
		of the text element.
	- Patch t/test.t to clean up the string name of the test.

1.01  2016-02-25T13:53:00
	- No code changes.
	- After I had a fight with github, git updated t/test.t to restore the obsolete name cell.svg
		instead of synopsis.svg as the file to be compared to the output of the test, so the test
		failed.

1.00  2016-02-21T15:05:00
	- Original version
