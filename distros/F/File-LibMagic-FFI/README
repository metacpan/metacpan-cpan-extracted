NAME

    File::LibMagic::FFI - Determine MIME types of data or files using
    libmagic

VERSION

    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

     use File::LibMagic;
     
     my $magic = File::LibMagic->new;
     
     # prints a description like "ASCII text"
     print $magic->describe_filename('path/to/file'), "\n";
     print $magic->describe_contents('this is some data'), "\n";
     
     # Prints a MIME type like "text/plain; charset=us-ascii"
     print $magic->checktype_filename('path/to/file'), "\n";
     print $magic->checktype_contents('this is some data'), "\n";

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a simple Perl interface to libmagic. It provides the
    same full undeprecated interface as File::LibMagic, but it uses
    FFI::Platypus instead of XS for its implementation, and thus can be
    installed without a compiler.

API

    This module provides an object-oriented API with the following methods:

 new

     my $magic = File::LibMagic->new;
     my $magic = File::LibMagic->new('/etc/magic');

    Creates a new File::LibMagic::FFI object.

    Using the object oriented interface provides an efficient way to
    repeatedly determine the magic of a file.

    This method takes an optional argument containing a path to the magic
    file. If the file doesn't exist, this will throw an exception.

    If you don't pass an argument, it will throw an exception if it can't
    find any magic files at all.

 checktype_contents

     my $mime_type = $magic->checktype_contents($data);

    Returns the MIME type of the data given as the first argument. The data
    can be passed as a plain scalar or as a reference to a scalar.

    This is the same value as would be returned by the file command with
    the -i option.

 checktype_filename

     my $mime_type = $magic->checktype_filename($filename);

    Returns the MIME type of the given file.

    This is the same value as would be returned by the file command with
    the -i option.

 describe_contents

     my $description = $magic->describe_contents($data);

    Returns a description (as a string) of the data given as the first
    argument. The data can be passed as a plain scalar or as a reference to
    a scalar.

    This is the same value as would be returned by the file command with no
    options.

 describe_filename

     my $description = $magic->describe_filename($filename);

    Returns a description (as a string) of the given file.

    This is the same value as would be returned by the file command with no
    options.

DEPRECATED APIS

    The FFI version does not support the deprecated APIs that
    File::LibMagic does.
