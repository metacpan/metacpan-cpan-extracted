=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Index::SegReader - Single-segment IndexReader.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $polyreader = KinoSearch::Index::IndexReader->open(
        index => '/path/to/index',
    );
    my $seg_readers = $polyreader->seg_readers;
    for my $seg_reader (@$seg_readers) {
        my $seg_name = $seg_reader->get_seg_name;
        my $num_docs = $seg_reader->doc_max;
        print "Segment $seg_name ($num_docs documents):\n";
        my $doc_reader = $seg_reader->obtain("KinoSearch::Index::DocReader");
        for my $doc_id ( 1 .. $num_docs ) {
            my $doc = $doc_reader->fetch_doc($doc_id);
            print "  $doc_id: $doc->{title}\n";
        }
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

SegReader interprets the data within a single segment of an index.

Generally speaking, only advanced users writing subclasses which manipulate
data at the segment level need to deal with the SegReader API directly.  

Nearly all of SegReader's functionality is implemented by pluggable
components spawned by L<Architecture|KinoSearch::Plan::Architecture>'s
factory methods.





=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_seg_name()

Return the name of the segment.

=head2 get_seg_num()

Return the number of the segment.



=head1 INHERITANCE

KinoSearch::Index::SegReader isa L<KinoSearch::Index::IndexReader> isa L<KinoSearch::Index::DataReader> isa L<KinoSearch::Object::Obj>.
