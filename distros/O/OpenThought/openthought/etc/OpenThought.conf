       The debug option allows you to enable a debugging frame, where all sorts
       of debugging information will be sent.  The frame will appear at the
       bottom of your browser, and in it contains instructions for it's use.
       Basically, you can resize it using the frame border, and you can scroll
       through the output using the scrollbar.  Simply enabling it here will
       cause it to appear along with all the debugging info.

       Aside from Netscape 4, all browsers which receive text into a select

       big, and can adversly affect other parts of your visual layout.
       This option allows us to modify the size of text going into a
       SelectBox, so the browser doesn't make the select box too big.
