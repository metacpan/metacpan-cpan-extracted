=head1 NAME

B<perlpoint> - a very general PerlPoint converter, using the generator interface

=head1 VERSION

This manual describes version B<0.03>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This general converter translates PerlPoint in any target language you have
PerlPoint::Generator subclasses installed for.

These classes can be installed in the usual Perl library pathes or in a
template. To get a list of available generators in the Perl path, call
this script with option "-generators". To see if a template provides an
additional generator, scan its "lib" subdirectory.

Usually, if you are working with a template, just start the converter as
described below. If there are libraries missing it will be notified.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perlpoint [<options>] <PerlPoint sources>

=head2 Options

All options can be abbreviated uniqly.

Please note that there are more options than described below. C<perlpoint>
just defines bootstrap options. For a complete option list please call
C<perlpoint> with C<-help> and the appropriate C<-target>, C<-formatter> and
C<-template> options, the help displayed will be adapted to this call.

=over 4

=item -help

displays a help and terminates. I<The help adapts itself to further options>, so
for best results it is recommended to enter all options that are intended to
used, and to add C<-help> additionally.

=item -target <format>

The format that should be produced. The argument is automatically uppercased.

To produce a format "FORMAT", C<PerlPoint::Generator::FORMAT> needs to be installed.

 Examples:

  -format sdf
  -format HTML

=item -formatter

The generator type to be used. This setting chooses a I<formatter> for the
target format.

 -formatter nice

Formatter names can be build hierarchically, delimiting hierarchy levels by double
colons:

 -formatter nice::impression

The arguments first letter of each hierarchy level is automatically uppercased.

 -formatter nice::impression is equivalent to
 -formatter Nice::Impression.

To produce a format "FORMAT" using a formatter "Nice", C<PerlPoint::Generator::FORMAT::Nice>
needs to be installed.

This option defaults to C<Default>. By convention there is a C<Default> formatter
for each supported target format.

=item -styledir

The directory to be searched for styles. Defaults to the start directory.

=item -style

The layout to be used. A layout defines the result format.

=item -version

displays the current program version and the versions of generator, formatter and template
modules that are loaded according to the remaining options.

=back

=head2 Option files

Options may be loaded from files where they are stored exactly as you write them in the
command line, but may be spread to several lines and extended by comment lines which start
with a "#" character. To mark an option file in the commandline, simply enter its (path and)
name prededed by a "@" character, for example

  perlpoint @myOptions ppfile

  where the file myOptions could look like

  # suppress infos
  -noinfo

Option files may be nested. To avoid endless recursion, every option file is resolved only
the first time it is detected.

  # this is an option file which
  # refers to another option file
  -noinfo @moreOptions

The script also takes care of I<default option files> which means that usual options can
be stored in files named C<.perlpoint>. If such a file is placed in the directory where the script itself
resides, options in the file are read in automatically by all perlpoint calls. These are global
settings. If you place such a file in your home directory, it is read automatically as well
but only if perlpoint is called under your account, so this is for personal preferences.

A personal default option file overwrites global settings, and all default options are
overwritten by options passed to the script call.
