NAME
    App::prowess - Watch files for changes and re-run prove

VERSION
    0.04

DESCRIPTION
    App::prowess is an application which will watch files for changes and
    the re-run "prove" on change.

SYNOPSIS
      # Watch default directories
      $ prowess -vl t/mytest.t

      # Watch just lib/ directory
      $ prowess -w lib -l -j6

      # Get debug information
      $ PROWESS_DEBUG=1 prowess -w lib t/mytest.t

    "-w" is used to watch directories or files for changes. "-w" without a
    following path will be passed on to "prove" as the "-w" flag. Any other
    option is passed directly to "prove".

SEE ALSO
    App::Prove::Watch is an alternative to "prowess". The main difference
    is:

    *   "prowess" will restart the test run on every file change. This means
        that if the test has not completed, "prove" will be "kill"ed and
        restarted. This is nice if you have tests that doesn't complete.
