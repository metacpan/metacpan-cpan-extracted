NAME
    Convert::Scalar - convert between different representations of perl
    scalars

SYNOPSIS
     use Convert::Scalar;

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports various internal perl methods that change the
    internal representation or state of a perl scalar. All of these work
    in-place, that is, they modify their scalar argument. No functions are
    exported by default.

    The following export tags exist:

     :utf8   all functions with utf8 in their name
     :taint  all functions with taint in their name
     :refcnt all functions with refcnt in their name
     :ok     all *ok-functions.

    utf8 scalar[, mode]
        Returns true when the given scalar is marked as utf8, false
        otherwise. If the optional mode argument is given, also forces the
        interpretation of the string to utf8 (mode true) or plain bytes
        (mode false). The actual (byte-) content is not changed. The return
        value always reflects the state before any modification is done.

        This function is useful when you "import" utf8-data into perl, or
        when some external function (e.g. storing/retrieving from a
        database) removes the utf8-flag.

    utf8_on scalar
        Similar to "utf8 scalar, 1", but additionally returns the scalar
        (the argument is still modified in-place).

    utf8_off scalar
        Similar to "utf8 scalar, 0", but additionally returns the scalar
        (the argument is still modified in-place).

    utf8_valid scalar [Perl 5.7]
        Returns true if the bytes inside the scalar form a valid utf8
        string, false otherwise (the check is independent of the actual
        encoding perl thinks the string is in).

    utf8_upgrade scalar
        Convert the string content of the scalar in-place to its
        UTF8-encoded form (and also returns it).

    utf8_downgrade scalar[, fail_ok=0]
        Attempt to convert the string content of the scalar from
        UTF8-encoded to ISO-8859-1. This may not be possible if the string
        contains characters that cannot be represented in a single byte; if
        this is the case, it leaves the scalar unchanged and either returns
        false or, if "fail_ok" is not true (the default), croaks.

    utf8_encode scalar
        Convert the string value of the scalar to UTF8-encoded, but then
        turn off the "SvUTF8" flag so that it looks like bytes to perl
        again. (Might be removed in future versions).

    utf8_length scalar
        Returns the number of characters in the string, counting wide UTF8
        characters as a single character, independent of wether the scalar
        is marked as containing bytes or mulitbyte characters.

    $old = readonly scalar[, $new]
        Returns whether the scalar is currently readonly, and sets or clears
        the readonly status if a new status is given.

    readonly_on scalar
        Sets the readonly flag on the scalar.

    readonly_off scalar
        Clears the readonly flag on the scalar.

    unmagic scalar, type
        Remove the specified magic from the scalar (DANGEROUS!).

    weaken scalar
        Weaken a reference. (See also WeakRef).

    taint scalar
        Taint the scalar.

    tainted scalar
        returns true when the scalar is tainted, false otherwise.

    untaint scalar
        Remove the tainted flag from the specified scalar.

    length = len scalar
        Returns SvLEN (scalar), that is, the actual number of bytes
        allocated to the string value, or "undef", is the scalar has no
        string value.

    scalar = grow scalar, newlen
        Sets the memory area used for the scalar to the given length, if the
        current length is less than the new value. This does not affect the
        contents of the scalar, but is only useful to "pre-allocate" memory
        space if you know the scalar will grow. The return value is the
        modified scalar (the scalar is modified in-place).

    scalar = extend scalar, addlen
        Reserves enough space in the scalar so that addlen bytes can be
        appended without reallocating it. The actual contents of the scalar
        will not be affected. The modified scalar will also be returned.

        This function is meant to make append workloads efficient - if you
        append a short string to a scalar many times (millions of times),
        then perl will have to reallocate and copy the scalar basically
        every time.

        If you instead use "extend $scalar, length $shortstring", then
        Convert::Scalar will use a "size to next power of two, roughly"
        algorithm, so as the scalar grows, perl will have to resize and copy
        it less and less often.

    refcnt scalar[, newrefcnt]
        Returns the current reference count of the given scalar and
        optionally sets it to the given reference count.

    refcnt_inc scalar
        Increments the reference count of the given scalar inplace.

    refcnt_dec scalar
        Decrements the reference count of the given scalar inplace. Use
        "weaken" instead if you understand what this function is fore.
        Better yet: don't use this module in this case.

    refcnt_rv scalar[, newrefcnt]
        Works like "refcnt", but dereferences the given reference first.
        This is useful to find the reference count of arrays or hashes,
        which cannot be passed directly. Remember that taking a reference of
        some object increases it's reference count, so the reference count
        used by the *_rv-functions tend to be one higher.

    refcnt_inc_rv scalar
        Works like "refcnt_inc", but dereferences the given reference first.

    refcnt_dec_rv scalar
        Works like "refcnt_dec", but dereferences the given reference first.

    ok scalar
    uok scalar
    rok scalar
    pok scalar
    nok scalar
    niok scalar
        Calls SvOK, SvUOK, SvROK, SvPOK, SvNOK or SvNIOK on the given
        scalar, respectively.

    inclusion in this module If you want them, write me.
