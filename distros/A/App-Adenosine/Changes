2.000001  2012-11-24 15:49:06 CST6CDT
 - Rename to Adenosine
 - Complete reimplementation in perl because this doesn't actually work in zsh
   at all
 - Removed the html filtering (and thus -Z) and converted it to just an
   separate command (h2t)
 - Remove pp (temporarily) due to name conflict

1.5  2011-03-20
 - Curl options can now be specified when calling the resty command to set
   the URI base. These options will be passed to curl for all subsequent
   requests, until the next time the resty command is called.

1.4  2011-03-08
 - Finalized bug fix for zsh users.

1.3  2011-03-04
 - Attempted bug fix for zsh users that prevented options from being passed
   correctly to curl.

1.2  2011-02-06
 - Data is now optional in PUT and POST requests. If the input is not a
   terminal and no data is specified on the command line, resty won't wait
   for data on stdin anymore. If you liked the old behavior you can always do
   something like `cat | POST /Somewhere` for the same effect.

1.1  2011-01-07
 - Fixed bug where -V option required input on stdin, and would block waiting
   for it.
