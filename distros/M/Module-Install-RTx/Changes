 - Backcompat workaround so you can ship static/css and static/js and on
   4.0 we copy to html/NoAuth/{css,js}.  Isn't a full win for images which
   needed a dhandler hack under 4.0.

0.33 2014-03-17
 - Better error message when requires_rt dies
 - Release a pent up set of changes now that they've been tested

0.32_02 2014-02-10
 - Avoid some false positives that would offer a make upgrade-database
   which cannot work.

0.32_01 2014-01-10
 - Now that we aren't packaging extensions against 3.6, we can use
   cmp_versions imported from RT core rather than copy/paste.
 - new rt_too_new which allows you to bail out before being installed on a
   version of RT which is too new for you to function normally on
   (corollary to requires_rt).
 - requires_rt now dies if your RT is too old rather than just warning.

0.32 2013-09-06

   4.0.14+ for maximum benefit, and is used in the RTIR 3.0 release
   series

 - Use the DatabaseAdmin configuration if supplied

 - Add support for a new 4.1 feature that records database changes made by
   the extension

0.29 2011-05-20

0.27 2010-12-16
 - Include RT's lib/ directory in INC so that requires() on RT::VERSION

   packages lurking in @INC

0.25 2009-10-08

 - delete VERSION from POD, we just always forget to update it

 - RT now respects the --datafile flag to rt-setup-database when used with
   --action acl or --action schema. Don't pass the initialdata file when
   we're doing schema changes

0.22 2008-03-25
 - Add local lib path to the @INC when we call any script that may load RT
   config.

0.21 2007-12-07

   now under the permissive "MIT" license.  See the COPYRIGHT section in
   README for the new terms.

 - Support for new RT 3.7 "RT Plugin" mechanism.
 - No longer tries to write to the global local perl man and site
   directories (packlists and manpages), instead installing them within the
   RT hierarchy.

0.11 2005-02-26
 - make initdb now prompts for dba password.

0.10 2004-09-09

 - Corrected the use of $ENV{RTHOME} and documented it.

   has its own initialdata and schema.
