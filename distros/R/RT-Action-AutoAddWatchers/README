NAME
    RT-Action-AutoAddWatchers - A more powerful $ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs

DESCRIPTION
    Automatically adds new watchers from the current transaction to the
    ticket, while trying to do so intelligently. The basic rules:

    *   Addresses are extracted from the To, Cc, and From headers.

    *   Any address matching a configured address for RT is discarded.

    *   Any address which is already a ticket watcher is discarded.

    *   If the address matches a privileged user, the user is added as a
        ticket AdminCc.

    *   Otherwise, the address is added as a ticket Cc.

    Notably, this does not skip addresses which are already queue watchers.
    The intent is to ensure that explicitly named people remain explicit on
    the ticket but don't receive duplicate mail. This is the reason for the
    distinction between ticket Cc/AdminCc, under the assumption that your
    queue watchers are AdminCcs. It also pairs nicely with a notification
    setup using RT::Extension::NotifyBasedOnOwnership and enables queue
    watchers to be looped into specific tickets via the initial email.

    The default installation does not create a scrip for you. You must do
    that for yourself using the new *Automatically add ticket watchers from
    new addresses* action. A suggested scrip is:

        Condition: On Create
        Action: Automatically add ticket watchers from new addresses
        Template: Blank
        Stage: Normal

    I strongly suggest only running this action *On Create* instead of on
    all correspondences (matching the behaviour of
    $ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs) so that watchers may not add themselves
    simply by replying to a ticket.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

    "make initdb"
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin("RT::Action::AutoAddWatchers");

        or add "RT::Action::AutoAddWatchers" to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
    Create a scrip (or scrips) as appropriate for your installation using
    the new action.
