Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Auth::Basic.

1.23 Wed Jan 21 00:46:28 2015
   => Fix for RT#100882.

1.22 Mon Aug 27 01:22:53 2012
   => Perl::Critic refactoring.
   => Distro fixes.

1.21 Wed Apr 22 04:30:21 2009
   => Update builder.

1.20 Sat Apr 18 05:27:47 2009
   => Updating distro.

1.11 Sun Dec 30 22:19:45 2007
   => Fixed RT#31947.
   => Fixed a security issue.

1.10 Sun Jun 18 04:07:02 2006
   => SIGNATURE sent to oblivion :p
   => Exit handler fix.
   => Oooh... I've just faced the infamous 
      "The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia"
      thing. Module now checks this error and enables 
      Crypt::UnixCrypt::crypt() if 'Crypt::UnixCrypt' exists, dies 
      otherwise.
   => Updated test suite.
   => Module::Build support.
   => Renamed some private methods to pass pod coverage test.

1.02 Sun Nov  7 05:27:49 2004
   => Changed default CHMOD value to 0777 (it was 0644).
      It must be 0666, but I think that 0777 is mostly 
      better for CGI apps.
   => Updated pod.
   => Fixed typo in error messages.
   => Added module version info to fatal html.

1.01 Tue Aug 31 16:14:39 2004
   => Added hidden option to new. You can now define 
      some hidden areas globally in the templates.
      They'll also be used in the query strings.
   => New method exit_code() to set the exit code.
      Default is CORE::exit.
1.0 Sat Feb 21 16:12:56 2004
   => First release.
