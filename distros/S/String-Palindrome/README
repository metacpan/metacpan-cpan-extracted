NAME
    String::Palindrome - Determine if a string is a palindrome

VERSION
    version 2.000001

SYNOPSIS
        use String::Palindrome qw/ is_palindrome /;


        #  Simple strings

        my $is     = 'abccba';
        my $is_not = 'abcdef';

        is_palindrome( $is      );  # 1

        is_palindrome( $is_not  );  # 0

        is_palindrome( {a => 1} );  # undef
        is_palindrome(          );  # undef



        #  Arrays

        my @is     = qw/ a ab cc ab a /;
        my @is_not = qw/ a ab cc a ba /;

        is_palindrome(  @is     );  # 1
        is_palindrome( \@is     );  # 1

        is_palindrome(  @is_not );  # 0
        is_palindrome( \@is_not );  # 0

        is_palindrome( []       );  # undef

EXPORTS
    *   is_palindrome

FUNCTIONS
  is_palindrome
    Returns true if the string, array, or array_ref is a palindrome. If more
    than one parameter is passed to the function, then it will blindly
    assume that you want to treat them as an array to be tested. This means
    that you could, theoretically, pass in a palindrome of array_refs and it
    would still pass.

    If only one arg is passed, then it is first checked to see if it is an
    array ref. If it is an array ref it is treated as a normal array. If it
    is a simple scalar, then it is treated as a string. If it is any other
    type of ref, then undef is returned. Additionally, a blank array ref
    also returns undef.
