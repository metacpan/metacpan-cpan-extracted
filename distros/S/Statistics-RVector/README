Statistics::RVector version 0.1
====================

Statistics::RVector, known in short as RVector, is a Perl module 
with the intent of providing somewhat of a compatibility layer between
the R Stats programming language and Perl.  That said, the basis of 
RVector is a vector library with vector math capabilities, and 
additionally supports statistical computation functions such as 
means, modes, standard deviation, and so forth.  However, as noted, 
the mechanics of this library are meant to mimic those of vectors 
in R.
