* support /a(1|0)+/ aka matching more than one time

* /(foo){1,2}/
* /(foo|bar){1,2}/
* /((foo|bar)){1,2}/

* Removing of always matching nodes should only be done on user request
  for a "simplified" graph:

* we could completely remove STAR() and anything below it:
  (it will always match)

	# perl -Mre=debug -e '/a1*/'
	Freeing REx: `","'
	Compiling REx `a1*'
	size 6 Got 52 bytes for offset annotations.
	first at 1
	rarest char a at 0
	   1: EXACT <a>(3)
	   3: STAR(6)
	   4:   EXACT <1>(0)
	   6: END(0)

* we could completely remove CURLYM where (left == 0) and anything below it:
  (it will always match)

	# perl -Mre=debug -e '/a(1|o)*/'
	Freeing REx: `","'
	Compiling REx `a(1|o)*'
	size 17 Got 140 bytes for offset annotations.
	first at 1
	rarest char a at 0
	   1: EXACT <a>(3)
	   3: CURLYM[1] {0,32767}(17)
	   7:   BRANCH(10)
	   8:     EXACT <1>(15)
	  10:   BRANCH(13)
	  11:     EXACT <o>(15)
	  15:   SUCCEED(0)
	  16:   NOTHING(17)
	  17: END(0)
