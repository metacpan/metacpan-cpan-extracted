NAME
    Locale::Tie - Get/set locale via (localizeable) variables

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of Locale::Tie (from Perl
    distribution Locale-Tie), released on 2014-10-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Locale::Tie qw($LANG $LC_ALL $LC_TIME); # ...
     say "Current locale is ", $LANG; # -> en_US.UTF-8
     {
         local $LANG = 'id_ID';
         printf "%.2f\n", 12.34;  # -> 12,34
     }
     printf "%.2f\n", 12.34; # -> 12.34

DESCRIPTION
    This module is inspired by File::chdir, using a tied scalar variable to
    get/set stuffs. One benefit of this is being able to use Perl's "local"
    with it, effectively setting something locally.

EXPORTS
    They are not exported by default, but exportable.

  $LANG => str
    Alias for $LC_ALL, but won't hashify.

  $LC_ALL => str | hash
    Return current locale as string. If different parts use different locale
    (e.g. LC_COLLATE uses one locale and LC_CTYPE uses another) will return
    a hash, e.g.:

     {
       LC_ADDRESS        => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_COLLATE        => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_CTYPE          => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_IDENTIFICATION => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_MEASUREMENT    => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_MESSAGES       => "id_ID.UTF-8",
       LC_MONETARY       => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_NAME           => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_NUMERIC        => "C",
       LC_PAPER          => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_TELEPHONE      => "en_US.UTF-8",
       LC_TIME           => "en_US.UTF-8",
     }
