NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::SubRequest - Make subrequests to actions in Catalyst

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst 'SubRequest';

        my $res_body = $c->subreq('/test/foo/bar', { template => 'magic.tt' });

        my $res_body = $c->subreq( {
           path            => '/test/foo/bar',
           body            => $body
        }, {
           template        => 'magic.tt'
        });

        # Get the full response object
        my $res = $c->subreq_res('/test/foo/bar', {
            template => 'mailz.tt'
        }, {
            param1   => 23
        });
        $c->log->warn( $res->content_type );

DESCRIPTION
    Make subrequests to actions in Catalyst. Uses the catalyst dispatcher,
    so it will work like an external url call. Methods are provided both to
    get the body of the response and the full response (Catalyst::Response)
    object.

METHODS
    subreq [path as string or hash ref], [stash as hash ref], [parameters as
    hash ref]
    subrequest
    sub_request
        Takes a full path to a path you'd like to dispatch to.

        If the path is passed as a hash ref then it can include body,
        action, match and path.

        An optional second argument as hashref can contain data to put into
        the stash of the subrequest.

        An optional third argument as hashref can contain data to pass as
        parameters to the subrequest.

        Returns the body of the response.

    subreq_res [path as string or hash ref], [stash as hash ref],
    [parameters as hash ref]
    subrequest_response
    sub_request_response
        Like "sub_request()", but returns a full Catalyst::Response object.
