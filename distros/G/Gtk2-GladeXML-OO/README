NAME
    Gtk2::GladeXML::OO - Drop-in replacement for Gtk2::GladeXML with object
    oriented interface to Glade.

SYNOPSIS
            use Gtk2::GladeXML::OO;
        
            # exactly as in Gtk2::GladeXML
            our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');
            $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_from_package('main');
            $gladexml->load_objects(qw/GUI_/);             # insert GUI objects to namespace
            $gladexml->debug(2);

            $::GUI_window->show;     # method "show" of widget with name "GUI_window"

            sub gtk_main_quit { Gtk2->main_quit; }

            # Object _MUST_ be declared as "our"
            our $myobject = MyObject->new();

            Gtk2->main;


            # ...and now callbacks in Glade can be:
            #
            #       myobject->method                <- Gtk2 will pass standard parameters to Your method
            #       myobject->method()              <- without any parameters, ie. window->hide()
            #       myobject->method("param0", "param1")    <- with Your parameters
            #       myobject->get_it()->do_sth("par0", "par1") <- multilevel call to Your object
            #       tree_view->get_selection->select_all()  <- multilevel call to Glade object!!
            #
            #       gtk_main_quit                   <- standard function interface, like before

            # See example.glade and example.pl in example directory!

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a clean and easy object-oriented interface in Glade
    callbacks (automagicaly loads objects and do all dirty work for you, no
    action is required on your part). Now You can use in callbacks: widgets,
    Your objects or standard functions like before. Callbacks can be even
    multilevel!

    Gtk2::GladeXML::OO is a drop-in replacement for Gtk2::GladeXML, so after
    a change from Gtk2::GladeXML to Gtk2::GladeXML::OO all Your applications
    will work fine and will have new functionality.

AUTOLOAD
    If You are using AUTOLOAD subroutine in main package, Gtk2::GladeXML::OO
    module will invoke it, when it cound'nt find any matching object in
    Glade file and Your code.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    new('/path/to/file.glade')
        This method should be called exactly as "new" in Gtk2::GladeXML. In
        example:

                # Gtk2::GladeXML::OO object
                our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');

    debug
        This method turns on/off debug. Three levels are acceptable.

                0  =>  turns OFF debug
                1  =>  turns ON debug (only important information/warnings), DEFAULT
                2  =>  turns ON debug in verbose mode, use this when You are in a trouble

        In example:

                # tunrs OFF debug
                $gladexml->debug(0);
        
                ...some code...

                # tunrs ON debug
                $gladexml->debug(1);
        
                ...some code...
                # turns ON debug in verbose mode
                $gledexml->debug(2);

    load_objects(qr/regexp/)
        This method loads to "main::" namespace all objects corresponding to
        widgets with names compatible with "regexp". Default "regexp" is set
        to "qr/^[A-Z]/".

    For all other methods see "Gtk2::GladeXML"!

DEPENDENCIES
    Carp (in standard Perl distribution)
    Gtk2::GladeXML

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None known. You can even use AUTOLOAD in Your application and all
    modules.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Limitation (will be resolved in a future): For now Your objects are
    loaded only from main package.
