Apache::PSP is a module which allows Perl Server Pages to be used within an
Apache/mod_perl environment. Perl Server Pages allow arbitrary Perl to be
embedded in HTML pages, which are compiled into Perl programs and executed
persistently. PSP pages can also define and use custom HTML-like tags which
provide shortcuts to program functions.

Perl Server Pages are explored in more detail in Chapter 12 of Perl for the Web
(New Riders 2001).
