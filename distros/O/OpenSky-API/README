NAME
    OpenSky::API - Perl interface to the OpenSky Network API

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
        use OpenSky::API;

        my $api = OpenSky::API->new(
            username => 'username',
            password => 'password',
        );

        my $states = $api->get_states;
        while ( my $vector = $states->next ) {
            say $vector->callsign;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: This module is deprecated in favor of WebService::OpenSky. This
    was an experiment to see how easy it would be to create this module
    using Github Copilot. It was a fun experiment, but there were some
    design flaws. Those are largely fixed in WebService::OpenSky.

    This is a Perl interface to the OpenSky Network API. It provides a
    simple, object-oriented interface, but also allows you to fetch raw
    results for performance.

    This is largely based on the official Python implementation
    <https://github.com/openskynetwork/opensky-api/blob/master/python/opensk
    y_api.py>, but with some changes to make it more user-friendly for Perl
    developers.

CONSTRUCTOR
    Basic usage:

        my $open_sky = OpenSky::API->new;

    This will create an instance of the API object with no authentication.
    This only allows you access to the "get_states" method.

    If you want to use the other methods, you will need to provide a
    username and password:

        my $open_sky = OpenSky::API->new(
            username => 'username',
            password => 'password',
        );

    You can get a username and password by registering for a free account on
    OpenSky Network <https://opensky-network.org>.

    Alternatively, you can set the "OPENSKY_USERNAME" and "OPENSKY_PASSWORD"
    environment variables, or create a ".openskyrc" file in your home
    directory with the following contents:

        [opensky]
        username = myusername
        password = s3cr3t

    If you'd like that file in another directory, just pass the "config"
    argument:

        my $open_sky = OpenSky::API->new(
            config => '/path/to/config',
        );

    By default, all methods return objects. If you want to get the raw
    results, you can set the "raw" attribute in the constructor:

        my $open_sky = OpenSky::API->new(
            raw => 1,
        );

    If you are debugging why something failed, pass the "debug" attribute to
    see a "STDERR" trace of the requests and responses:

        my $open_sky = OpenSky::API->new(
            debug => 1,
        );

METHODS
    For more insight to all methods, see the OpenSky API documentation
    <https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/>.

    Note a key difference between the Python implementation and this one:
    the Python implementation returns <None> if results are not found. For
    this module, you will still receive the iterator, but it won't have any
    results. This allows you to keep a consistent interface without having
    to check for "undef" everywhere.

  get_states
        my $states = $api->get_states;

    Returns an instance of OpenSky::API::States. if "raw => 1" was passed to
    the constructor, this will be the raw data structure instead.

    This API call can be used to retrieve any state vector of the OpenSky.
    Please note that rate limits apply for this call. For API calls without
    rate limitation, see "get_my_states".

    By default, the above fetches all current state vectors.

    You can (optionally) request state vectors for particular airplanes or
    times using the following request parameters:

        my $states = $api->get_states(
            icao24 => 'abc9f3',
            time   => 1517258400,
        );

    Both parameters are optional.

    *   "icao24"

        One or more ICAO24 transponder addresses represented by a hex string
        (e.g. abc9f3). To filter multiple ICAO24 append the property once
        for each address. If omitted, the state vectors of all aircraft are
        returned.

    *   "time"

        A Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). Only state vectors after
        this timestamp are returned.

    In addition to that, it is possible to query a certain area defined by a
    bounding box of WGS84 coordinates. For this purpose, add the following
    parameters:

        my $states = $api->get_states(
            bbox => {
                lomin => -0.5,     # lower bound for the longitude in decimal degrees
                lamin => 51.25,    # lower bound for the latitude in decimal degrees
                lomax => 0,        # upper bound for the longitude in decimal degrees
                lamax => 51.75,    # upper bound for the latitude in decimal degrees
            },
        );

    You can also request the category of aircraft by adding the following
    request parameter:

        my $states = $api->get_states(
            extended => 1,
        );

    Any and all of the above parameters can be combined.

        my $states = $api->get_states(
            icao24   => 'abc9f3',
            time     => 1517258400,
            bbox     => {
                lomin => -0.5,     # lower bound for the longitude in decimal degrees
                lamin => 51.25,    # lower bound for the latitude in decimal degrees
                lomax => 0,        # upper bound for the longitude in decimal degrees
                lamax => 51.75,    # upper bound for the latitude in decimal degrees
            },
            extended => 1,
        );

  get_my_states
        my $states = $api->get_my_states;

    Returns an instance of OpenSky::API::States. if "raw => 1" was passed,
    this will be the raw data structure instead.

    This API call can be used to retrieve state vectors for your own sensors
    without rate limitations. Note that authentication is required for this
    operation, otherwise you will get a 403 - Forbidden.

    By default, the above fetches all current state vectors for your states.
    However, you can also pass arguments to fine-tune this:

        my $states = $api->get_my_states(
            time    => 1517258400,
            icao24  => 'abc9f3',
            serials => [ 1234, 5678 ],
        );

    *   "time"

        The time in seconds since epoch (Unix timestamp to retrieve states
        for. Current time will be used if omitted.

    *   <icao24>

        One or more ICAO24 transponder addresses represented by a hex string
        (e.g. abc9f3). To filter multiple ICAO24 append the property once
        for each address. If omitted, the state vectors of all aircraft are
        returned.

    *   "serials"

        Retrieve only states of a subset of your receivers. You can pass
        this argument several time to filter state of more than one of your
        receivers. In this case, the API returns all states of aircraft that
        are visible to at least one of the given receivers.

  "get_arrivals_by_airport"
        my $arrivals = $api->get_arrivals_by_airport('KJFK', $start, $end);

    Returns an instance of OpenSky::API::Flights. if "raw => 1" was passed,
    you will get the raw data structure instead.

    Positional arguments:

    *   "airport"

        The ICAO code of the airport you want to get arrivals for.

    *   "start"

        The start time in seconds since epoch (Unix timestamp).

    *   "end"

        The end time in seconds since epoch (Unix timestamp).

    The interval between start and end time must be smaller than seven days.

  "get_departures_by_airport"
    Identical to "get_arrivals_by_airport", but returns departures instead
    of arrivals.

  "get_flights_by_aircraft"
        my $flights = $api->get_flights_by_aircraft('abc9f3', $start, $end);

    Returns an instance of OpenSky::API::Flights. if "raw => 1" was passed
    to the constructor, you will get the raw data structure instead.

    The first argument is the ICAO24 transponder address of the aircraft you
    want.

  "get_flights_from_interval"
        my $flights = $api->get_flights_from_interval($start, $end);

    Returns an instance of OpenSky::API::Flights. if "raw => 1" was passed
    to the constructor, you will get the raw data structure instead.

  "limit_remaining"
        my $limit = $api->limit_remaining;

    The methods to retrieve state vectors of sensors other than your own are
    rate limited. As of this writing, this is only "get_states". See
    limitations
    <https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#limitations> for
    more details.

EXAMPLES
    Perl Wikipedia, OpenSky Network
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSky_Network> is ...

        The OpenSky Network is a non-profit association based in Switzerland that
        provides open access of flight tracking control data. It was set up as
        a research project by several universities and government entities with
        the goal to improve the security, reliability and efficiency of the
        airspace. Its main function is to collect, process and store air traffic
        control data and provide open access to this data to the public. Similar
        to many existing flight trackers such as Flightradar24 and FlightAware,
        the OpenSky Network consists of a multitude of sensors (currently around
        1000, mostly concentrated in Europe and the US), which are connected to
        the Internet by volunteers, industrial supporters, academic, and
        governmental organizations. All collected raw data is archived in a
        large historical database, containing over 23 trillion air traffic control
        messages (November 2020). The database is primarily used by researchers
        from different areas to analyze and improve air traffic control
        technologies and processes

  Elon Musk's Jet
    However, this data can be used to track the movements of certain
    aircraft. For example, Elon Musk's primary private jet (he has three,
    but this is the one he mainly uses), has the ICAO24 transponder address
    "a835af". Running the following code ...

        use OpenSky::API;

        my $musks_jet = 'a835af';
        my $openapi   = OpenSky::API->new;

        my $days = 7;
        my $now  = time;
        my $then = $now - 86400 * 7;    # up to 7 days ago

        my $flight_data = $openapi->get_flights_by_aircraft( $musks_jet, $then, $now );
        say "Jet $musks_jet has " . $flight_data->count . " flights";

    As of this writing, that prints out:

        Jet a835af has 6 flights

ETHICS
    There are some ethical considerations to be made when using this module.
    I was ambivalent about writing it, but I decided to do so because I
    think it's important to be aware of the privacy implications. However,
    it's also important to be aware of the climate implications

    ollution-more-than-doubles-in-europe>.

    Others are using the OpenSky API to model the amount of carbon being
    released by the aviation industry, while others have used this public
    data to predict corporate mergers and acquisitions. There are a wealth
    of reasons why this data is useful, but not all of those reasons are
    good. Be good.

TODO
    *   Implement rate limits

    *   Add a "is_rate_limited" method to results

    *   Add Waypoints and Flight Routes
