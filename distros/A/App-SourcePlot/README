App::SourcePlot
===============

Source Plot was created to help observers decide which sources to observe
at particular times to optimize the observing time at the telescope.
The main purpose of this program is to plot the movement of a source
throughout the night.  The movement can be plotted by the source's
elevation, azimuth, parallactic angle, or by time.
