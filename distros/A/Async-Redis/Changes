    - New Feature: Enhanced Lua Script Helper API
        - define_command() for registering named scripts with metadata
        - run_script() for executing registered scripts by name
        - get_script(), list_scripts() for registry access
        - preload_scripts() for pipeline optimization
        - Automatic EVALSHA with EVAL fallback (NOSCRIPT handling)
        - Pipeline integration via $pipe->run_script()
        - Optional method installation (install => 1)
        - Support for fixed or dynamic key counts
    - Script.pm Enhancements:
        - New run() method with explicit keys/args arrays
        - New run_on() method for explicit connection targeting
        - Metadata fields: name, num_keys, description
    - Documentation:
        - New LUA SCRIPTING section in Async::Redis POD
        - Comprehensive examples for all script methods
        - Pipeline integration examples
    - Testing:

    - Bug Fix: Concurrent command response matching
        - Fixed race condition where multiple async commands on a single
          connection could receive mismatched responses
        - Implemented Response Queue pattern with FIFO ordering
        - Commands now register in inflight queue before sending
        - Single reader coroutine processes responses in order
    - New Features:
        - Added inflight_count() method to check pending commands
        - Added _wait_for_inflight_drain() for pipeline/PubSub synchronization
    - Documentation:
        - Added CONCURRENT COMMANDS section to POD
        - Documented Response Queue pattern and best practices
    - Testing:
        - Added t/92-concurrency/response-ordering.t test suite
        - Tests for concurrent SET, GET, mixed command types
        - Stress test with 100 concurrent commands
        - Inflight tracking verification
