NAME
    AnyEvent::AIO - truly asynchronous file and directory I/O

SYNOPSIS
       use AnyEvent::AIO;
       use IO::AIO;

       # can now use any of the aio requests your IO::AIO module supports
       # as long as you use an event loop supported by AnyEvent.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an AnyEvent user, you need to make sure that you use and
    run a supported event loop.

    Loading this module will install the necessary magic to seamlessly
    integrate IO::AIO into AnyEvent, i.e. you no longer need to concern
    yourself with calling "IO::AIO::poll_cb" or any of that stuff (you still
    can, but this module will do it in case you don't).

    The AnyEvent watcher can be disabled by executing "undef
    $AnyEvent::AIO::WATCHER". Please notify the author of when and why you
    think this was necessary.

SEE ALSO
    AnyEvent, Coro::AIO (for a more natural syntax).
