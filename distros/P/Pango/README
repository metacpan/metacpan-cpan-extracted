Pango
=====

Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an emphasis on
internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed,
but using Pango in conjunction with L<Cairo> and/or L<Gtk2> provides a complete
solution with high quality text handling and graphics rendering.

BUG REPORTS
-----------

For help with problems, please contact the mailing list (above).  If you
already know you have a bug, please file it with one of the bug trackers
below.  With any problems and/or bug reports, it's always helpful for the
developers to have the following information:

- A small script that demonstrates the problem; this is not required, however,
  it will get your issue looked at much faster than a description of the
  problem alone.
- Version of Perl (perl -v)
- Versions of Gtk2-Perl modules (Glib/Gtk2/Pango/Cairo)
- Optional, but nice to have: versions of GTK+ libraries on your system
  (libglib, libgtk+, libpango, libcairo, etc.)

There are multiple project bug trackers, please choose the one you are most
comfortable with using and/or already have an account for.

Request Tracker:
- submitting bugs via the Web (requires a PAUSE account/Bitcard):
  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=Pango
- submitting bugs via e-mail (open to anyone with e-mail):
  bug-Pango [at] rt.cpan.org

Gnome's bugtracker:

  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gnome-perl

PATCH SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------------

You can send us patches by...
- E-mailing it to the mailing list (above); please use a pastebin service of
  some kind for longer patchfiles (over say 20k in size).
- Those with gnome.org Git ID's can push trivial patches to git directly; if
  you're not sure what a trivial patch is, please ask first on the mailing
  list prior to pushing your commit.


OBTAINING SOURCE FROM THE GNOME.ORG GIT REPO
--------------------------------------------

Assuming you already have the 'git' command installed on your system, you can
use the 'git://' protocol:

 git clone git://git.gnome.org/perl-Pango

Or, read-only access via HTTP:

 git clone http://git.gnome.org/browse/perl-Pango

To update an existing clone of the source:

 git pull

Most Linux distros package the 'git' command in a package called either 'git'
or 'git-core'.
