Finance/Bank/Postbank_de version 0.20
==================================

This is a module faciliating access to the german
Postbank online banking website at https://banking.postbank.de.
It has been renamed from Finance::Bank::Postbank, as there
also is a netherlands Postbank at http://www.postbank.nl,
which is not related.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  WWW::Mechanize

  an SSL module for LWP

I tried hard to avoid the dependencies on Test::Inline, and I use
some cheap modified pod2test script to enable prerequisite checking
for my synopsis code - so if you rebuild the Test::Inline examples,
these tests might fail because of prerequisites not met.

The synopsis uses the following additional modules :

  Tie::File

  List::Sliding::Changes
