DESCRIPTION

The package enables you to automatically create screenshots of your web
server pages for the user guide or whatever you need it for. The best
part is that you don't bother yourself with scrolling and object
localization. Just tell the ID of the element and receive an
Image::Magick object. The package will do all the scrolling work, it
will take the screenshots and glue the parts together.
