HTML::CMTemplate

This package allows programmers to create templates using PHP-style tags.  The
template language is very powerful and expressive, and the interpreter is very
CPU and memory efficient.

It compiles the templates once during program execution and then leaves them
in memory for very fast realization.

No C compiler is required.  This is a pure, 100% Perl module.

Full documentation comes with it.  Simply type perldoc HTML::CMTemplate
(or man HTML::CMTemplate) after installation, and you are off and running.

ALSO: There is a VIM syntax file included.  It is in the 'contrib' directory.
If you don't know how to use it, just email me, and I'll give you details.
