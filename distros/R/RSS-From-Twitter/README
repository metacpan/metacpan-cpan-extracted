NAME
    RSS::From::Twitter - Convert Twitter page to RSS

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.08 of RSS::From::Twitter (from Perl
    distribution RSS-From-Twitter), released on 2017-07-10.

SYNOPSIS
     # Use command-line scripts get-rss-from-twitter{,-list,-search,-user}

FUNCTIONS
  get_rss_from_twitter
    Usage:

     get_rss_from_twitter(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

    Convert Twitter page to RSS.

    In June 2013, Twitter retired the RSS v1 API (e.g.
    http://search.twitter.com/search.rss?q=blah, etc). However, its
    replacement, the v1.1 API, is not as straightforward to use (e.g. needs
    auth). This function scrapes the Twitter search result page (e.g.
    https://twitter.com/search?q=blah) and converts it to RSS. I wrote this
    because I have other scripts expecting RSS input.

    Expect breakage from time to time though, as scraping method is rather
    fragile.

    This function is not exported by default, but exportable.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   title => *str*

        RSS title.

    *   ua => *obj*

        Supply a custom LWP::UserAgent object.

        If supplied, will be used instead of the default LWP::UserAgent
        object.

    *   url* => *str*

        URL, e.g. https://twitter.com/foo or file:/test.html.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
