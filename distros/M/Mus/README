NAME

    Mus - Mu but with slightly more typing and strict constructors

SYNOPSIS

      package Foo;
      use Mus;
    
      ro "hro";
      lazy hlazy => sub { 2 };
      rwp "hrwp";
      rw "hrw";
    
      my $foo = Foo->new(i_don_exist => 5, hro => "exists", hrwp => "exists", hrw => "exists");
    
      # Found unknown attribute(s) passed to the constructor: i_dont_exist at (eval 30) line 52.
      #     Foo::new("Foo", "i_dont_exist", 5, "hro", "exists", "hrwp", "exists", "hrw", ...) called at Foo.pl line 9

DESCRIPTION

    Mus imports both Mu and MooX::StrictConstructor making it even less
    work in typing and reading to set up an object with a strict
    constructor.

    Mu::Role should still be used for roles, as strict constructors don't
    apply to roles, so I did not duplicate this.
