0.07  2004-07-28
    - Changed ::TAI64, test scripts after a DateTime.pm change
      concerning leap seconds.

      +++ ATTENTION +++
      If you use an epoch before 1972, and you do not ignore leap
      seconds, you may see a 1 second difference in the results compared
      to the output of version 0.06 or earlier.

      If you use ::TAI64, the epoch has been corrected for this, and
      timestamps after 1972 are unchanged.

      If you use ::Unix or any of the other predefined epochs, you're
      safe; these ignore leap seconds
