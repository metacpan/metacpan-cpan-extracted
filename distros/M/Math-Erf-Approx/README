NAME
    Math::Erf::Approx - pure Perl approximate implementation of the error
    function

DESCRIPTION
    This is a pure Perl implementation of the error function (a.k.a. the Gauss
    error function). It gives an approximation with a maximum absolute
    difference of 0.0005 from the real value.

  Functions
    This module can export two functions. Neither is exported by default. This
    module uses Sub::Exporter, so the functions can be renamed:

     use Math::Erf::Approx -all => { -prefix => 'math_' };

    `erf($x)`
        Calculates the result of the error function for value $x.

    `erfc($x, \&erf)`
        Given a value $x and a code reference to an implementation of erf(),
        calculates the complement.

        If the code reference is ommitted (which I'd expect would be the most
        usual case), then the default is the `erf` function provided by this
        module.

  Testing
    It is possible to run a small test suite on this module using:

     use Math::Erf::Approx;
     Math::Erf::Approx->run_tests;

BENCHMARKS
    Benchmarking against Games::Go::Erf (on a fairly underpowered netbook)...

     Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of GGE, MEA...
       GGE:  6 wallclock secs ( 6.34 usr +  0.01 sys =  6.35 CPU) @ 15748.03/s (n=100000)
       MEA:  3 wallclock secs ( 2.71 usr +  0.00 sys =  2.71 CPU) @ 36900.37/s (n=100000)

    There are considerations other than raw speed though...

    *   Games::Go::Erf provides much more accurate results

    *   ... and it can calculate inverses

    *   ... but it has a dependency on Tk

    *   ... and it sets $[ to 1, which has been deprecated since Perl 5.12.
