	- brought commit() into line with Class::DBI (needs 0.35)

0.09  2001-10-05
	- tweaks to commit() to cope with overloaded values
		(temporary measure until this gets rolled into Ima::DBI)
		[commit() still doesn't work with the latest Class::DBI features]

0.08  2001-07-18
	- 'initials' method had problem with DISTINCT and ORDER BY in older
		MySQLs. Changed how it was implemented.

0.07  2001-07-18
	- added 'initials' method
	- Moved to Test::More

0.06  2001-07-08
	- reversed order of set-up in set_up_table to specify PRIMARY
		before ALL, to avoid bug in inheritance where it would add
		PRIMARY to ALL, even if you were just about to change PRIMARY.
	- fixed bug with those tighter restrictions!

0.05  2001-07-07
	- introduced tighter restrictions on tests for ORDER BY RAND
		and FULLTEXT searching, which weren't implemented until 3.23.02
	- added attributes() and search_range() [Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa]

	- first CPAN release
	- renamed to Class::DBI::mysql at the request of Michael Schwern

0.03  2001-06-23

		contained an underscore in its name, magically autoincrementing
		the name would fail to give a valid table name.

0.02  2001-06-14
	- added support for CURDATE(), NOW()

0.01  2001-05
	- original version (Class::DBI::MySQL)
