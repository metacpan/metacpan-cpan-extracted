NAME
    Text::Replace - replace variables from a hash

SYNOPSIS
     #######
     # Subroutine Interface
     #
     use Text::Replace qw(&replace_variables);
     $success = replace_variables(\$template, \%variable_hash, \@variable);

     ########
     # Class Interface
     #
     use Text::Replace;
     $success = Text::Replace->replace_variables(\$template, \%variable_hash, \@variable);

DESCRIPTION
    The "Text::Replace" program module is simple and plain by design. The
    "Text::Replace" program module mimics the built-in Perl double quote,
    '"', literal scalar that replaces Perl scalar variables named with a
    leading '$'. The "Text::Replace" program module stays in the background,
    just like John William's movie scores. There is no large manual thicker
    than the Bible with tricks and tips and gyrations to learn and to
    distract. The module is plain, simple with no expressiveness. The
    "Text::Replace" program module does only one thing: substitute a value
    for a variable. It is amazing how many times, just a simple double quote
    literal replacement in a small string or even a large text string gets
    the job done.

    Does "Text::Replace" solve all variable replacement, template problems?
    Definitely not. There is no capabilities for inserting graphs, text wrap
    plug-ins, GD interface. If an application needs something this
    sophisticated, there are many fine template program modules in CPAN such
    as the highly rated "Template" program module.

SUBROUTINES
  replace_variables

    The "replace_variables" subroutine, takes a "\$template" reference
    containing Perl scalar variables, always named the leading *funny
    character* '$', and recursively looks up the value for the scalar
    variables in the "\%variable_hash" and replaces the value in the
    "\$template". The "replace_variables" subroutine only replaces those
    variables in the "\@variable" list.

REQUIREMENTS
    Some day.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script "Replace.t" verifies the requirements for this
    module. The "tmake.pl" cover script for Test::STDmaker automatically
    generated the "Replace.t" test script, "Replace.d" demo script, and
    "t::Text::Replace" program module POD, from the "t::Text::Replace"
    program module contents. The "tmake.pl" cover script automatically ran
    the "Replace.d" demo script and inserted the results into the
    'DEMONSTRATION' section above. The "t::Text::Replace" program module is
    in the distribution file Text-Replace-$VERSION.tar.gz.

    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Text::Replace" program module is simple and plain. This is
    intentional. The "Text::Replace" mimics the built-in Perl double quote,
    '"', literal scalar that replaces Perl scalar variables named with a
    leading '$'. The "Text::Replace" program module foregoes expressiveness
    for convenience and performance. Like a movie score, it stays in the
    background. There is no large manual thicker than the Bible with tricks
    and tips and gyrations to learn and to distract. It is amazing how many
    times, just a simple double quote literal replacement in a small text
    string or even a large text string gets the job done.

    Does "Text::Replace" solve all variable replacement, template problems?
    Definitely not. There is no capabilities for inserting graphs, text wrap

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    Test-STD-STDutil-0.01
        Rename Module
            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: A second thing
            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away the template and table routines from Test::TestUtil
            created this module Test::STD::STDutil.

    Test-STD-STDutil-0.02
        Use the new modules from the break-up of the "File::FileUtil" module

    Text-Replace-0.01
        Broke up the "Test::STD::STDutil" module and moved it to more
        appropriate places in the high level directory tree.

    Text-Replace-0.02
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Text-Replace-0.03
        Recreate distribution file with Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode
        777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get emails from Unix
        installers about untar not being able to change to a directory with
        mode of 666.

    Text-Replace-0.04
        Add the module 'Data::Secs2' in the tlib that provides 'stringify'
        support for the 'Test::Tech' module.

    Text-Replace-0.05
        The lastest build of "Test::STDmaker" expects the test library in
        the same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/Text, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        "File::TestPath" program module, adding the "Data::SecsPack" and
        "Data::Startup" to the test library.

        Added Description, Subroutines, See Also headers. Clean up the
        Quality Assurance and Notes.

    Text-Replace-0.06
        Broken POD link cause big problems with pod2html. Fixed and run
        throught podchecker.

    Text-Replace-0.07
        Had the wrong name in POD NAME section. Fixed.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.
