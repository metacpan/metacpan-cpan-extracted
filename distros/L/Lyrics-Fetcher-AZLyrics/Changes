Revision history for Perl extension Lyrics::Fetcher::AZLyrics.

0.05 - 2010-04-15
    Handle changes to AZLyrics site
    Improve test script.
    This gets things working again at least, although this module could use
    some TLC.

0.04  (2008/09/11)
    AZLyrics.com changed their HTML slightly, adding ringtones adverts.

0.03
    fix comments in test scripts (thanks to James Ronan)

0.02 - 2007-02-05 
    Er... the test script tested calling this module via
    Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch(), which isn't a good idea since we don't
    have a dependency on Lyrics::Fetcher.
    Changed to call L:F:A->fetch() directly to avoid test failures.
    
0.01 - 2007-02-03
