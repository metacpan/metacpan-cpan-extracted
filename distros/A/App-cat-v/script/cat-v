Version 1.05

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<cat -v> command is often used to display characters that cannot
be displayed, but is not always suitable for viewing the output of
modern applications because it converts all non-ASCII characters.

The C<cat-v> command visualizes whitespace and control characters
while preserving the display of displayable graphic characters.

=end html

Also, by default, escape characters are not converted, so decorations
by ANSI escape sequences are retained.

=end html

Sometimes it is desirable to visualize whitespace characters.  The
C<cat -t> command can visualize tab characters, but the problem is
that it breaks the visual format.  We may want to see which parts are
tabs and which parts are space characters while preserving the format.
Extra whitespace characters at the end of a line can also be noticed
by visualizing them.

Using C<cat-v>, tab characters are visualized in such a way that the
space on the display does not change.

Control characters can be displayed in control format and Unicode
symbol characters.  By default, control characters other than newline
and escape characters are displayed as corresponding Unicode symbols.

The second field is the default action. C<s> stands for symbol, C<m>
for Unicode mark, and C<0> for no conversion.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 7

=item B<-n>, B<--reset>

Disables all character conversions and tab expansion, and resets
repeat characters.  Therefore, the C<cat-v -n> effectively does
nothing, just like the C<cat> command.

Once the default behavior is reset, only options specified after it
will have any effect.  For example, the following command will only
visualize tab characters.

    cat-v -nt

=item B<-c>, B<--visible> I<name>=I<flag>,...

Give the character type and flags as parameters to specify the
character to be visualized and the conversion format.

    c  control style
    e  escape style
    s  symbol style
    m  Unicode mark (if exists)
    0  do not convert
    *  non-alphanumeric char is used as a replacement

Option C<-c nl=1> can also be used to visualize newline characters.
For newline characters only, after displaying the result of the
conversion, the original character is output at the same time.

Use the names in the list above to specify by character type.  If you
want to convert escapes without converting tabs, use the following

    cat-v -c tab=0 -c esc=s

Multiple items can be specified at the same time.  The following
example sets C<tab> and C<bel> to 0 and C<esc> to C<s>.

    cat-v -c tab=bel=0,esc=s

If C<all> is specified for the name, the value applies to all
character types.  The following command sets all characters to C<s>,
then sets C<nl>, C<nl>, C<np>, and C<sp> to C<m> and disables C<esc>.
This is the default state.

    cat-v -c all=s,nul=nl=np=sp=m,esc=0

If none of the name labels are specified, it is assumed that C<all> is
given.  The following command prints all control characters except
newlines in escaped form, which is compatible with the Perl's string
literal.

    cat-v -n -ce,nl=0

The above command is identical to this.

    cat-v --reset --visible all=e,nl=0

=item B<-->I<name>[=I<replacement>]

All control characters can also be accessed by an option with their
name.  For example, option C<--nl> is defined for the newline
character.

Used alone, it activates the visibility of the character.

    cat-v --nl

To disable, give the value 0.

    cat-v --nl=0

If a letter other than an alphabet or a number is given, it will be
replaced by that letter.

    cat-v --nl='$'

If a string of two or more characters is given, it is interpreted as a
Unicode character name.

    cat-v --nl='RETURN SYMBOL' --sp='MIDDLE DOT'

If flag begins with C<+>, that character is added to the repeat list.

    cat-v --esc=+s

So the above command will have the same meaning as if you had written
as following.

    cat-v --esc=s --repeat +esc

=item B<--repeat>=I<name>[,I<name>...]

Specifies the character type for outputting the original character at
the same time as the converted character.  The default setting is
C<nl,np>.  The following will correctly output the original ANSI
sequence with the escape character visualized.

    cat-v -c esc --repeat esc,nl

If I<name> begins with C<+>, add that character in addition to the
existing configuration.

    cat-v -c esc --repeat +esc

=item B<-o>, B<-oo>, B<--original>

If the converted string is different from the original string, the
original string is output before the converted string is output.  If
specified twice, the original string is always printed.

You can use this output with L<App::cdif>'s C<--line-by-line>
(C<--lxl>) option.

=item B<-t>[I<n>], B<--expand>[=I<n>]

=item B<-T>, B<--no-expand>

Tab characters are expanded by default.  To explicitly disable it, use
the B<-T> or B<--no-expand> option.

If an optional number is given for the B<-t> option, it is treated as
a tab width.  The following two commands are equivalent:

    cat-v -t4
    cat-v -t --tabstop=4

By default, the style C<needle> is applied, which can be changed with
C<--tabstyle>. If the C<--tabstyle> option is specified with no
arguments, a list of available styles is displayed.

You can disable tab expansion by default by putting the following
setting in your C<~/.cat-vrc> file.

    option default --no-expand

In such cases, tab expansion can be temporarily enabled by the C<-t>
option.

=item B<--tabstop>=# (DEFAULT: 8)

Set tab width.

=item B<--tabhead>=#

=item B<--tabspace>=#

Set tab head and following space characters.  If the option value is
longer than single character, it is evaluated as unicode name.

=item B<--tabstyle>, B<--ts>

=item B<--tabstyle>=I<style>, B<--ts>=...

=item B<--tabstyle>=I<head-style>,I<space-style> B<--ts>=...

Set the style how tab is expanded.  Select C<symbol> or C<shade> for
example.  If two style names are combined, like
C<squat-arrow,middle-dot>, use C<squat-arrow> for tabhead and
C<middle-dot> for tabspace.

Show available style list if called without parameter.  Styles are
defined in L<Text::ANSI::Fold> library.

=item B<-C>=I<color>, B<--color>=I<color>

Replaced characters are displayed in the color specified by the
I<color>.  This option is not suitable for output containing ANSI
color sequences.

=item B<-E>, B<--escape-backslash>

Convert backslash character to the escaped form C<\\>.

Although backslash is not a control character, this way the result of
converting other control characters to escape expressions can be fully
interpreted as string literal of various programming language.

The following command reproduces the complete contents of the original
file.

    echo -ne "$(cat-v -Ence FILE)"
