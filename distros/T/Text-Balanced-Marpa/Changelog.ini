Comments= <<EOT
- Remove redundant code.
- Greatly expand docs (e.g. FAQ) re differences between this module and its companion
Text::Delimited::Marpa.
- Make some sample code match that of Text::Delimited::Marpa, so the outputs of the 2 modules
can be quoted in the docs.

[V 1.06]
Date=2015-01-19T09:39:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Warning: Incompatible change. The method parse() now takes a hash, whose keys can be any of
of these: length, options, pos and text.
- Warning: Incompatible change. The constant debug is now called print_debugs. This makes it
less likely the name will clash with your pre-existing code.
- Warning: Incompatible change. Add the new constant print_errors. Since this constant is off by
default, errors are not printed until you use this constant. This means the code is quieter.
- Patch the docs to match.
- Patch the sample code and test code to match.

Comments= <<EOT
- Move tree2string(), and all the methods it uses - node2string(), format_node() and
hashref2string() -, into the Tree V 1.06 class. This means that all the code which used to
use $parser -> tree2string now needs to use $parser -> tree -> tree2string.

[V 1.02]
Date=2014-12-31T11:10:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change the default value for text() from '' to \''. That was a typo fix.
- Add the length() and pos() mutators, to allow the user to control the call to the recognizer's
read() method. See the FAQ.
- Add the exhaustion_is_fatal option. See error_number() == 6 for details.
- Add t/skip.prefix.t to demonstrate pos() and length().
- Add scripts/tiny.pl for quick tests without Test::More.
- Add the escape_char() mutator, to allow the user to overrider the default escape char.
- Add t/non.default.escapes.t to demonstrate escape_char().
- Add more error numbers, corresponding the 'die's which were not previously consistent with the
way error_numbers and error_messages should be set.
- Comment explicitly all 'die's within the scope of try{} catch{}, and visa versa. This affects
how 'Error: ' is only added once to error messages being printed.

Date=2014-12-29T08:41:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Stop including the string 'Error: ' twice in error messages.
- Stop the option print_warnings from printing the tree. Leave that to the caller.
- Change docs to match.
- Change scripts/*.pl and t/*.t to match.
- Change the output of tree2string() where there was an extra vertical dash at the start of the
last line in some cases (which the original code in Tree::DAG_Node did not print).
- Clean up the docs.
- Rename t/parenthises.t to t/parentheses.t.
