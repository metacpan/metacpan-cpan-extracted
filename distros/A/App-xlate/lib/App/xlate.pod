=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<XLATE> is a versatile command-line tool designed as a user-friendly
frontend for the B<greple> C<-Mxlate> module, simplifying the process
of multilingual automatic translation using various API services.  It
streamlines the interaction with the underlying module, making it
easier for users to handle diverse translation needs across multiple
file formats and languages.

A key feature of B<xlate> is its seamless integration with Docker
environments, allowing users to quickly set up and use the tool
without complex environment configurations.  This Docker support
ensures consistency across different systems and simplifies
deployment, benefiting both individual users and teams working on
translation projects.

B<xlate> supports various document formats, including C<.docx>,
C<.pptx>, and C<.md> files, and offers multiple output formats to suit
different requirements.  By combining Docker capabilities with
built-in make functionality, B<xlate> enables powerful automation of
translation workflows.  This combination facilitates efficient batch
processing of multiple files, streamlined project management, and easy
integration into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
pipelines, significantly enhancing productivity in large-scale
localization efforts.

=head2 Basic Usage

To translate a file, use the following command:

    xlate -t <target_language> <file>

For example, to translate a file from English to Japanese:

    xlate -t JA example.txt

=head2 Translation Engines

xlate supports multiple translation engines.  Use the -e option to
specify the engine:

    xlate -e deepl -t JA example.txt

Available engines: deepl, gpt3, gpt4, gpt4o

=head2 Output Formats

Various output formats are supported. Use the -o option to specify the format:

    xlate -o cm -t JA example.txt

Available formats: xtxt, cm, ifdef, space, space+, colon

=head2 Docker Support

B<xlate> offers seamless integration with Docker, providing a powerful
and flexible environment for translation tasks.  This approach
combines the strengths of xlate's translation capabilities with
Docker's containerization benefits.

=head3 Key Concepts

=over 4

=item B<Git Friendly>

If you are working in a git environment, the git top directory is
automatically mounted, which works seamlessly with git commands.
Otherwise the current directory is mounted.

=item B<Containerized Environment>

By running xlate in a Docker container, you ensure a consistent and
isolated environment for all translation tasks.  This eliminates
issues related to system dependencies or conflicting software
versions.

=item B<Integration with Make>

The Docker functionality can be combined with xlate's B<make> feature,
allowing for complex, multi-file translation projects to be managed
efficiently within a containerized environment. For example:

    xlate -DM -t 'EN FR DE' project_files/*.docx

This command runs B<xlate> in a Docker container, utilizing make to
process multiple files with specified target languages.

=item B<Environment Variable Handling>

With the ability to pass specific environment variables into the
container (C<-E>), you can easily manage API keys and other
configuration settings without modifying the container itself.

=back

=head2 Make Support

xlate utilizes GNU Make for automating and managing translation tasks.
This feature is particularly useful for handling translations of
multiple files or to different languages.

To use the make feature:

    xlate -M [options] [target]

xlate provides a specialized Makefile (F<XLATE.mk>) that defines
translation tasks and rules.  This file is located in the xlate
library directory and is automatically used when the -M option is
specified.

Example usage:

    xlate -M -t 'EN FR DE' document.docx

This command will use make to translate document.docx to English,
French, and German, following the rules defined in XLATE.mk.

The C<-n> option can be used with C<-M> for a dry-run, showing what
actions would be taken without actually performing the translations:

    xlate -M -n -t 'EN FR DE' document.docx

Users can customize the translation process using parameter files:

=over 4

=item F<*.LANG>:

Specifies target languages for a specific file

=item F<*.FORMAT>:

Defines output formats for a specific file

=item F<*.ENGINE>:

Selects the translation engine for a specific file

=back

For more detailed information on the make functionality and available
rules, refer to the F<XLATE.mk> file in the xlate library directory.

=head2 XLATERC File

The F<.xlaterc> file allows you to set default options for the
C<xlate> command.  This file is searched in the Git top directory and
the current directory.  If found, its contents are applied before any
command-line options.

Each line in the C<.xlaterc> file should contain a valid C<xlate>
command option.  Lines starting with C<#> are treated as comments and
ignored.

For example, if the following line is set in F<.xlaterc>, C<xlate>
will use the specified container image when docker is run.

    -I tecolicom/texlive-groff-ja:v1.35

=back

=head2 MAKE OPTIONS

=over 7

=item B<-M>

Run make.

=item B<-n>

Dry run.

=back

=head2 DOCKER OPTIONS

Docker feature is invoked by the C<-D>, C<-C> or C<-L> option.
Once any of these options appear, subsequent options are not
interpreted, so it should always be the last of Docker related
options.

=over 7

=item B<-D> I<options>

Run B<xlate> scirpt on the Docker container with the rest of the
parameters.

=item B<-C> [ I<command> ]

Execute the following command on the Docker container, or run a shell
if no command is provided.

=item B<-L> [ I<command> ]

When executed without arguments, option C<-L> attaches to a running
container (performs C<docker attach>).  If the container does not
exist, a new container is created, and if there is a stopped
container, it is restarted before attaching.

If executed with command arguments, the command is executed on the
running container (performs C<docker exec>).  If the container does
not exist, it creates a new container executing the given command.
Therefore, the next time it attaches, it connects to the container
that executes that command.

Target container is distinguished by name.  The default container name
is C<xlate>.  The last portion of the Docker image to run is given as
the name of the container.  If a directory to mount is specified, the
name of that directory is added after dot (C<.>).  For example, if you
run C<ubuntu:latest> image with mounting home directory (C<-H>), the
container name will be C<ubuntu.yourname>.

=begin comment

Naturally, the other docker options only apply the first time the
container is launched.  Use the C<-K> option to remove the existing
container before starting.  The C<-KA> option can be used to restart
the container.

=end comment

=back

When running in a docker environment, the L<git(1)> top directory is
mounted if you are in a directory under git, otherwise current
directory is mounted.  Working directory will still be moved to the
current location within that tree.

=over 7

=item B<-W>

Mount current working directory.

=item B<-H>

Mount user's home directory.  The environment variable C<HOME> is set
to the mount point.

=begin comment

=item B<-G>

Mount L<git(1)> top-level directory.  This is the default behavior, so
it does virtually nothing.

=end comment

=item B<-U>

Do not mount any directory.

=item B<-R>

Mount directory as read-only.

=item B<-V> I<from>:I<to>

Specify the additional directory to be mounted.
Repeatable.

=item B<-E> I<name>[=I<value>]

Specify environment variable to be inherited in Docker.
Repeatable.

=item B<-I> I<image>

Specify Docker image name.  If it begins with a colon (C<:>), it is
treated as a version of the default image.

=item B<-B>

Run the container in batch mode.  Specifically, run C<docker> command
without the C<--interactive> and C<--tty> options.

=item B<-N>

Specifies the name of the live container explicitly.  Once you have
created a container named C<xlate>, you can connect to it with just
the C<-A> option.

=item B<-K>

Kill and remove the existing live container.  If a container with the
specified name (default is C<xlate>) exists, it will be stopped and
removed.

=begin comment

If specified as C<-KL>, then a new container is launched after the
existing container is removed.
