  - Now overloading
      -X file tests
      atan2 cos sin exp abs log sqrt int
      readline
      ~~
      ++ --
      =
      neg ! ~
  - Shortcutting some execution by also overloading
    += -= *= /= %= **= <<= >>= x= .=
  - Maybe now works for REF, LVALUE, REGEXP, VSTRING, BIND references too
