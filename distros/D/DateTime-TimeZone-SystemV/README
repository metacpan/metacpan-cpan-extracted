NAME

DateTime::TimeZone::SystemV - System V and POSIX timezone strings

DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class represents a timezone that was specified by
means of a System V timezone recipe or the POSIX extended form of the
same syntax.  These can express a plain offset from Universal Time, or
a system of two offsets (standard and daylight saving time) switching
on a yearly cycle according to certain types of rule.

This class implements the DateTime::TimeZone interface, so that its
instances can be used with DateTime objects.
