NAME

    Clustericious - (Deprecated) A framework for RESTful processing
    systems.

VERSION

    version 1.29

SYNOPSIS

    Generate a new Clustericious application:

     % clustericious generate app MyApp

    Basic application layout:

     package MyApp;
     
     use Mojo::Base qw( Clustericious::App );
     
     sub startup
     {
       my($self) = @_;
       $self->SUPER::startup;
       # app startup
     }
     
     package MyApp::Routes;
     
     use Clustericious::RouteBuilder;
     
     # Mojolicious::Lite style routing
     get '/' => sub { shift->render(text => 'welcome to myapp') };

    Basic testing for Clustericious application:

     use Test::Clustericious::Cluster;
     use Test::More tests => 4;
     
     # see Test::Clustericious::Cluster for more details
     # and examples.
     my $cluster = Test::Clustericious::Cluster->new;
     $cluster->create_cluster_ok('MyApp');    # 1
     
     my $url = $cluster->url;
     my $t   = $cluster->t;   # Test::Mojo object
     
     $t->get_ok("$url/")                      # 2
       ->status_is(200)                       # 3
       ->content_is('welcome to myapp');      # 4
     
     __DATA__
     
     @ etc/MyApp.conf
     ---
     url: <%= cluster->url %>

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: This module has been deprecated, and may be removed on or after
    31 December 2018. Please see
    https://github.com/clustericious/Clustericious/issues/46.

    Clustericious is a web application framework designed to create
    HTTP/RESTful web services that operate on a cluster, where each service
    does one thing and ideally does it well. The design goal is to allow
    for easy deployment of applications. Clustericious is based on the
    Mojolicious and borrows some ideas from Mojolicious::Lite
    (Clustericious::RouteBuilder is based on Mojolicious::Lite routing).

    Two examples of Clustericious applications on CPAN are Yars the archive
    server and PlugAuth the authentication server.

FEATURES

    Here are some of the distinctive aspects of Clustericious :

      * Simplified route builder based on Mojolicious::Lite (see
      Clustericious::RouteBuilder).

      * Provides a set of default routes (e.g. /status, /version, /api) for
      consistent interaction with Clustericious services (see
      Clustericious::Plugin::CommonRoutes).

      * Introspects the routes available and publishes the API as /api.

      * Automatically handle different formats (YAML or JSON) depending on
      request (see Clustericious::Plugin::AutodataHandler).

      * Interfaces with Clustericious::Client to allow easy creation of
      clients.

      * Uses Clustericious::Config for configuration.

      * Uses Clustericious::Log for logging.

      * Integrates with Module::Build::Database and Rose::Planter to
      provide a basic RESTful CRUD interface to a database.

      * Provides 'stop' and 'start' commands, and high-level configuration
      facilities for a variety of deployment options.
