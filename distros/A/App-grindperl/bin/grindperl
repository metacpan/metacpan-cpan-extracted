=head1 NAME

grindperl - Command-line tool to help build and test bleadperl

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

These commands are intended to be run from within a clone of
the Perl git repository.

  # Configure && make && make test (in parallel)
  $ grindperl

  # Configure && make && make test_porting (in parallel)
  $ grindperl --porting

  # Same as first example, but without threads
  $ grindperl --no-threads

  # Configure/make/test and install
  $ grindperl --prefix=/opt/perl/blead --install

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hacking on the Perl source tree requires one to regularly build and test.  The
C<< grindperl >> tool helps automate some common configuration, build and test
tasks.  Most Perl 5 porters have written something like this and I'm putting
mine on CPAN to help new (or less automated) contributors.

Instead of typing this:

  $ ./Configure -des -Dusedevel -Dcc='ccache=gcc' \
    -Dprefix=/tmp/blead-$(git describe) -DDEBUGGING \
    -Dusethreads
  $ make -j 9 test_prep
  $ TEST_JOBS=9 make test_harness

You can just type this:

  $ grindperl

If you want to run C<< make test_porting >> before committing or before
merging a submitted patch -- which is strongly encouraged -- that is
as easy as:

  $ grindperl --porting

Generally, the following steps are taken (unless modified by options):

=over 4

=item *

clean the source directory, with C<< git clean -dxf >> or C<< make distclean >>

as necessary

=item *

run C<< Configure >> with desired options

=item *

run either C<< make test_harness >> or C<< make test_porting >> or C<< make test_prep >>

depending on various options

=back

If anything fails along the way, C<< grindperl >> will stop with an error message.

=head1 OPTIONS

Any boolean options that default to true may be negated by prefixing their long
form with C<< no- >>, e.g. C<< --no-threads >>.

=head2 --config

Boolean flag.  When set, C<< grindperl >> will halt after running C<< Configure >>.
Default is false.

=head2 --jobs=N or -j N

Controls how many parallel make jobs to run.  Defaults to 9.

=head2 --testjobs=N or -t N

Controls the number of parallel test jobs to run.  Defaults to 9.
Setting this to 0 will run C<< make test_prep >> but will not run tests.

=head2 --porting

Boolean flag.  When set, C<< make test_porting >> will be run instead
of C<< make test_harness >>.  The number of jobs to run in parallel
will still be based on the C<< --testjobs >> option.  Default is false.

=head2 --install

Boolean flag.  When set, C<< grindperl >> will run C<< make install >> after all
other steps.  Be sure to set C<< --prefix >> to a writeable destination.  Default
is false.

=head2 --output FILE or -o FILE

Instructs C<< grindperl >> to merge STDERR and STDOUT and redirect output
to the given file to capture build/test results.

=head2 --prefix PATH

Sets an explicit installation path via C<< -Dprefix=... >>.

If not set, a default prefix will be calculated relative to C<< --install_root >>.

If a C<< .git >> directory exists, the prefix will resemble C<< ROOT/BRANCH-DESCRIBE >>
if a branch can be determined or C<< ROOT/fromgit-DESCRIBE >> if the branch cannot
be determined (as from a detached HEAD).  E.g. given the default C<< --install_root >>
of C<< /tmp >>, the prefix for the blead branch might resemble this:

  /tmp/blead-v5.15.1-22-g5213914

This ensures the the prefix is different for different places in the
commit history.

If there is no C<< .git >> directory, then the prefix will resemble
C<< ROOT/DIRNAME-EPOCH >> where DIRNAME is the name of the current directory
and EPOCH is the number of epoch seconds.

  /tmp/perl-5.15.1-1311278560

These prefix choices ensure that installing different grindperl runs
will generally not clobber each other.

=head2 --install_root

A base path for a generated default C<< --prefix >>. The default install root
is C<< /tmp >>.  This needs to be a directory for which you have write
permissions.

=head2 --debugging

Boolean flag.  Sets C<< -DDEBUGGING >>.  Default is true.

=head2 --threads

Boolean flag.  Sets C<< -Dusethreads >>.  Default is true.

=head2 --cache

Boolean flag.  When true, C<< grindperl >> will save your C<< config.sh >>
and C<< Policy.sh >> files to a hidden cache file.  If these files
exist, it will restore them and run C<< Configure >> with the C<< -r >> option.

Using cached config files from a different commit can break things
and is not recommended.

Defaults to false.

=head2 --man

Boolean flag.  When false, C<< grindperl >> will disable man directories
and man files will not be generated or installed.  Defaults to false.

=head2 --verbose or -v

Outputs some extra progress messages and warnings.

=head2 --define KEY=VALUE or -D KEY=VALUE

=head2 --undefine KEY or -U KEY

=head2 --additions KEY=VALUE or -A KEY=VALUE

May be specified multiple times with different values of KEY.  These set
the C<< -D >>, C<< -U >> and C<< -A >> options for C<< Configure >>.  Note
that unlike C<< Configure >>, these require a space between the option and
the key or key/value pair.

=head2 --32 (EXPERIMENTAL)

This experimental flag tries to force as much 32-bitness as possible, even on
a 64 bit operating system.  It's very hacky, messes with compiler and linker
flags and is not guaranteed on all platforms.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

You can put command line options into a configuration file, one per line,
and they will be prepended to C<< @ARGV >> before options are processed.  For
example, here is what I have in my config file.

    --install_root=/opt/perl
    -D cc='ccache gcc'
    -D cf_by=dagolden
    -D cf_email='dagolden@cpan.org'
    -D perladmin='dagolden@cpan.org'
    -D optimize=-g
    -A ccflags=-DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV

To edit the config file, be sure your C<< EDITOR >> environment variable is set
and then run C<< grindperl --edit >>.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item *

You must have git installed and in your path

=item *

This depends on certain shell redirection constructs and is unlikely to work on non-POSIX systems
