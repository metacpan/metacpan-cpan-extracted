    - "When connecting to the server and enabling passive mode, the port
       returned to the client reports the upper 8 bits of the 2-byte port range
       as a 16-bit number." -Eric Rybski, Thanks Eric!

0.06 Sun Apr 18 19:56:25 2004
	- Fixed bug that killed the server if a datasession connection wasn't made and _drop was called
	- Now we depend on v0.04 of Filesys::Virtual

0.05 Sun Apr 18 13:57:50 2004
	- Fixed a bug related to using PASV and bandwidth limiting
	- Added version to example server.pl
	- XSEN command support added, calls xsen event, return undef if not allowed
	- Fixed a bug that didn't flush the response before disconnecting,
		via a timeout or a QUIT
	- Sending data via the control connection is more reliable, and
		won't kill the server when the connection is dropped unexpectedly
	- Forking doesn't look feasable right now, suggestions welcome...
	- Changed all events dispatched to the registered session, so they will have
		ftpd_ in front
	- added ftpd_write_log, see examples
	- Started a Curses::UI::POE client/server example, currently it doesn't have
		authentication or anything to connect to the server_daemon.pl server.
		I'm using this as a basis of what I should add to the component to function
		as a great ftpd :) Run server_daemon.pl then as many server_manager.pl as you
		like. Theres chat too.
	- I started to add a virus checking routine, ignore it. its going to be a post
		processor.  Optional of course.
