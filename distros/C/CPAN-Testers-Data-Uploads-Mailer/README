CPAN-Testers-Data-Uploads-Mailer
================================

This distribution is part of the CPAN Testers tools that provides verification
of CPAN uploads and mails reports to authors where uploads would fail to be 
tested by CPAN Testers, and thus don't typically conform to the standard
package format that most modern CPAN distributions use.

CPAN TESTERS FUND

  CPAN Testers wouldn't exist without the help and support of the Perl 
  community. However, since 2008 CPAN Testers has grown far beyond the 
  expectations of it's original creators. As a consequence it now requires
  considerable funding to help support the infrastructure.

  In early 2012 the Enlightened Perl Organisation very kindly set-up a
  CPAN Testers Fund within their donatation structure, to help the project
  cover the costs of servers and services.

  If you would like to donate to the CPAN Testers Fund, please follow the link
  below to the Enlightened Perl Organisation's donation site.

    https://members.enlightenedperl.org/drupal/donate-cpan-testers

  If your company would like to support us, you can donate financially via the
  fund link above, or if you have servers or services that we might use, please
  send an email to admin@cpantesters.org with details.

  Our full list of current sponsors can be found at our I <3 CPAN Testers site.

  There are no known bugs at the time of this release. However, if you spot a

  help greatly if you are able to pinpoint problems or even supply a patch.
