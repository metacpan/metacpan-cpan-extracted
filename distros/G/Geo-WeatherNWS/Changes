    - Address bug 27513 (Geo-WeatherNWS returns wrong station code) from Guenter Knauf.
    - Changes to deal with undefined values used for calculations to avoid warnings.
      To make it easier to check for undefined values, some calculations were moved
      into functions.
    - Windchill is now returned as undefined for temperatures above 50 F or
      wind speeds below 4 mph.
    - The knots to mph conversion is slightly different.
    - The distance conversion is slightly different.
    - We now round results instead of truncating them to integers, which
      will provide slightly different answers in some cases.
    - The value "ptemerature" is now spelled "ptemperature"
      Added wind speed in kmh
    - Fix bug for handling conditions without modifiers
    - Relax rules for ICAO names to allow numbers as well as letters for the last 3 characters
    - Change ICAO website
