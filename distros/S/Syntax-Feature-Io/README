NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Io - Provides IO::All

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use syntax qw( io );

        my @own_lines = io(__FILE__)->getlines;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a syntax feature extension for syntax providing IO::All.

    Not much additional use is provided, besides much easier access if you
    are already using syntax in one way or another.

METHODS
  install
        $class->install( %arguments )

    Used by syntax to install the extension in the requesting namespace.
    Only the arguments "into" and "options" are recognized.

OPTIONS
  -import
        use syntax io => { -import => [-strict] };

    You can use this option to pass import flags to IO::All. Since this is
    the option you'll most likely use, if any, you can skip the hash
    reference and provide the import list directly if you wish:

        use syntax io => [-strict];

    Please see "USAGE" in IO::All for documentation on the import arguments.

  -as
        use syntax io => { -as => 'IO' };

        my @own_lines = IO(__FILE)->getlines;

    Set the name of the import.
