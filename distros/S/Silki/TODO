* Print-friendly stylesheet

* Table layout can overlap tags box and other parts of page

* Export
    * set of HTML pages
    * pdf

* Inline feed - {{feed: http://.../foo.rss}}

* Inline internal and external (Google) search

* Backlinks for attachments?
    * wikipedia implements attachments & images as special types of pages, I think

* Determine wiki by path or hostname (dev.wiki.company.com or wiki.company.com/wiki/dev)?

* AJAX suggestions for tags

* FT search for attachment content

* Make per-wiki user lists sortable on something besides name.

* Move/copy pages between wikis

* Gardening features - mass tag/untag, mass delete, mass move, mass rename via
  regex, ...

* Proper WYSIWYG editor

* Image gallery like MojoMojo?

= Reporting

* Logins?
* Attachment views, edits?

= Archiving feature

* auto-archiving of unread content somehow
    * only shows up in search when explicitly asked for

= Users

* allow email aliases for purposes of logging in

= Other

* Remove all monkey-patching (Session plugin, ErrorHandling, HTTP::Body
  filename preservation hack)
    * session unhacking would ideally involve building an alternate, much simpler
      session mechanism
