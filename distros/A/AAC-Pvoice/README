AAC::Pvoice README

As of version 0.5, these modules should be able to run on all platforms
supported by Device::ParallelPort. This dependency has to do with AAC::Pvoice::Input, which
needs to be able to poll the parallel port in case it needs to communicate
with the 'Adremo' electrical wheelchair. For this I'm  using
Device::ParallelPort, which has drivers for Linux and Win32.

As of version 0.6 the modules allow you to use your application in
One or Two-button mode. See the documentation of AAC::Pvoice::Input for details.

As of version 0.9 you need Image::Magick.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
