Regexp::English 
---------------

Perl module to create regular expressions more verbosely

INSTALLATION

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ perl ./Build
	$ perl ./Build test
	# perl ./Build install

There's also a Makefile.PL file, but I don't use it.

DESCRIPTION

    Regexp::English provides an alternate regular expression syntax, one
    that is slightly more verbose than the standard mechanisms. In addition,
    it adds a few convenient features, like incremental expression building
    and bound captures.
