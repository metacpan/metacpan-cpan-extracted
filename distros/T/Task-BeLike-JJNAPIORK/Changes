    - New copyright date and minor increases to the dependency versions

0.08 2010-12-30

    - Removed unused dependencies
    - changed Makefile setup to reflect my modern practice
    - documented above

0.05 2010-09-22
    - Removed App::Ack, since its not someone you need to do the most basic
      deployment stuff that is the goal of this distribution.
    - Clean up of the Makefil.PL to be more explicit in what it needs

0.04 2010-09-17

    - Swapped MI::ReadmePodFromPod to MI::ReadMeMarkdownFromPod.
    - Added MI::Homepage and MI::License for more automation.
    - Added a Module::Setup custom flavor (the one I like :) )
    - Changed Makefile.PL to reflect and test above.  Addes docs as well.

0.03 2010-09-15
    - took out CARP::REPL since it's a debugging tool, not something that fits
      the role of this module which is intended to be a sort of personal SDK,
      not a catchall of everything I use all the time.
    - Add Module::Install::ManifestSkip since I hate having to copy this around
      and have it clutter up my repo.
    - Added MI:ReadmeFromPOD since sometimes we want a text only README.
