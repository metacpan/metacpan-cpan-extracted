0.50 Thu Oct 28 23:02:19 BST 2010

  - Explicitly set the location of cpanp-run-perl when under PERL_CORE
    in t/inc/conf.pl

0.46 Sat Jan 23 07:52:19 GMT 2010

0.38 Mon Aug 24 13:59:11 BST 2009
  - Cosmetic change to the test output message so it
    matches CPANPLUS::Dist::MM (bingos)

0.36 Sat Jul  4 14:51:42 BST 2009

    absence spotted by Matt Trout

0.35_03 Tue Jun 30 22:48:57 BST 2009

0.35_02 Sat Jun 27 09:35:55 BST 2009

  - Fixed the 02packages.details.txt.gz file in our fake CPAN
      CPANPLUS-0.87_01 now checks this file for sanity. Ours

    loading. Reported by Andy Dougherty

0.28 Fri May  8 10:58:42 BST 2009
  - Add the CPANPLUS bin/ dir to $ENV{PATH} if we are running
    under PERL_CORE. This fixes warnings during 'make test' in
    the core. No need for other users to upgrade.

0.26 Thu May  7 16:40:26 BST 2009
  - Integrated the t/inc/conf.pl and dummy-CPAN/ structure from
    CPANPLUS into the testsuite. This resolves the issue where

    Spotted by Steve Hay, fixed with help from Jos Boumans.

0.24 Mon Apr 27 16:55:37 BST 2009

0.06_03	Mon Feb  9 16:31:10 GMT 2009

 - process separation for Build.PL, Build, test and install actions, 
   using IPC::Cmd (bingos)
 - If M::B is version 0.31_03 or greater use 'Build prereq_data' to
   work out prereqs, otherwise fallback on poking around in _build/
   like CPAN.pm does. (bingos)
 - Resolved issues with test reports for FAILs being misgraded as UKNOWN. (bingos)

   changes in this release; users need not upgrade.

0.04  Wed Aug 16 22:00:18 CDT 2006

 - Address RT #13926: build_requires not included in prerequisites

 - Address RT #14240 Why does it say "Params::Check" in the README 
   Description?

 - Address RT #13937 Won't install without force because newer 
   version installed (from CPANPLUS 0.055?)

 - Update dependency versions in Makefile.PL
  
 - We were sending cpantesters 'pass' reports whenever --force was in
   effect, which is probably not the right thing to do. [Jos Boumans]
