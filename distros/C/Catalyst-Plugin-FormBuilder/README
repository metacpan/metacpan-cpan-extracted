NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::FormBuilder - (DEPRECATED) Catalyst FormBuilder Plugin

SYNOPSIS
        # Please see Catalyst::Controller::FormBuilder instead

        package MyApp;
        use Catalyst qw/FormBuilder/;

        package MyApp::Controller::Example;
        use base 'Catalyst::Controller';

        #
        # The simplest example looks for edit.fb to create
        # a form, based on the presence of the ":Form" attribute.
        # Use Local/Global/Private/etc to scope methods like normal.
        #
        sub edit : Local Form {
            my ($self, $c, @args) = @_;
            $c->form->field(name => 'email', validate => 'EMAIL');
            $c->form->messages('/locale/messages.fr');
        }

        #
        # This example references edit still, since we are 
        # just switching to a readonly view. The layout will be
        # the same, but fields are rendered as static HTML.
        # Note that the Catalyst action URL remains /books/view
        #
        sub view : Local Form('/books/edit') {
            my ($self, $c) = @_;
            $c->form->static(1);      # set form to readonly
        }

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    This module has been deprecated in favor of
    Catalyst::Controller::FormBuilder. Please do not use it in new code. It
    has known compatibility issues and is absolutely not supported by
    anyone. It remains only in case you have existing code that relies on
    it.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin merges the functionality of CGI::FormBuilder with Catalyst
    and Template Toolkit. This gives you access to all of FormBuilder's
    niceties, such as controllable field stickiness, multilingual support,
    and Javascript generation. For more details, see CGI::FormBuilder or the
    website at:

        http://www.formbuilder.org

    FormBuilder usage within Catalyst is straightforward. Since Catalyst
    handles page rendering, you don't call FormBuilder's "render()" method,
    as you would normally. Instead, you simply add a ":Form" attribute to
    each method that you want to associate with a form. This will give you
    access to a FormBuilder "$c->form" object within that controller method:

        # An editing screen for books
        sub edit : Local Form {
            # The file books/edit.fb is loaded automatically
            $c->form->method('post');   # set form method
        }

    The out-of-the-box setup is to look for a form configuration file that
    follows the CGI::FormBuilder::Source::File format (essentially YAML),
    named for the current action url. So, if you were serving "/books/edit",
    this plugin would look for:

        root/forms/books/edit.fb

    (The path is configurable.) If no source file is found, then it is
    assumed you'll be setting up your fields manually. In your controller,
    you will have to use the "$c->form" object to create your fields,
    validation, and so on.

    Here is an example "edit.fb" file:

        # Form config file root/forms/books/edit.fb
        name: books_edit
        method: post
        fields:
            title:
                label: Book Title
                type:  text
                size:  40
                required: 1
            author:
                label: Author's Name
                type:  text
                size:  80
                validate: NAME
                required: 1
            isbn:
                label: ISBN#
                type:  text
                size:  20
                validate: /^(\d{10}|\d{13})$/
                required: 1
            desc:
                label: Description
                type:  textarea
                cols:  80
                rows:  5
            country:
                label: Country of Origin
                type:  select
                required: 1

        submit: Save New Book

    This will automatically create a complete form for you, using the
    specified fields. Note that the "root/forms" path is configurable; this
    path is used by default to integrate with the "TTSite" helper.

    Within your controller, you can call any method that you would on a
    normal "CGI::FormBuilder" object on the "$c->form" object. To manipulate
    the field named "desc", simply call the "field()" method:

        # Change our desc field dynamically
        $c->form->field(name  => 'desc',
                        label => 'Book Description',
                        required => 1);

    To populate field options for "country", you might use something like
    this to iterate through the database:

        $c->form->field(name    => 'country',
                        options => [ map { [$_->id, $_->name] }
                                     $c->model('MyApp::Country')->all ],
                        other   => 1,   # create "Other:" box
                        );

    This would create a select list with the last element as "Other:" to
    allow the addition of more countries. See CGI::FormBuilder for methods
    available to the form object.

    The FormBuilder methodolody is to handle both rendering and validation
    of the form. As such, the form will "loop back" onto the same controller
    method. Within your controller, you would then use the standard
    FormBuilder submit/validate check:

        if ($c->form->submitted && $c->form->validate) {
            $c->forward('/books/save');
        }

    This would forward to "/books/save" if the form was submitted and passed
    field validation. Otherwise, it would automatically re-render the form
    with invalid fields highlighted, leaving the database unchanged.

    To render the form in your template, you can use "render" to get a
    default table-based form:

        <!-- root/src/books/edit.tt -->
        [% form.render %]

    You can also get fine-tuned control over your form layout from within
    your template.

TEMPLATES
    The simplest way to get your form into HTML is to reference the
    "form.render" method, as shown above. However, frequently you want more
    control.

    From within your template, you can reference any of FormBuilder's
    methods to manipulate form HTML, JavaScript, and so forth. For example,
    you might want exact control over fields, rendering them in a "<div>"
    instead of a table. You could do something like this:

        <!-- root/src/books/edit.tt -->
        <head>
          <title>[% form.title %]</title>
          [% form.jshead %]<!-- javascript -->
        </head>
        <body>
          [% form.start %]
          <div id="form">
            [% FOREACH field IN form.fields %]
            <div id="[%- field.name -%]">
              <div class="label">
                [% field.required
                      ? qq(<span class="required">$field.label</span>)
                      : field.label
                %]
              </div>
              <div class="field">
                [% field.tag %]
                [% IF field.invalid %]
                    <span class="error">
                        Missing or invalid entry, please try again.
                    </error>
                [% END %]
              </div>
            </div>
            [% END %]
            <div id="submit">[% form.submit %]</div>
            <div id="reset">[% form.reset %]</div>
            <div id="state">
              [% # The following two tags include state information %]
              [% form.statetags  %]
              [% form.keepextras %]
              [% form.end        %]
            </div>
          </div><!-- form -->
        </body>

    In this case, you would not call "form.render", since that would only
    result in a duplicate form (once using the above expansion, and a second
    time using FormBuilder's default rendering).

    Note that the above form could become a generic "form.tt" template which
    you simply included in all your files, since there is nothing specific
    to a given form hardcoded in (that's the idea, after all).

    You can also get some ideas based on FormBuilder's native Template
    Toolkit support at CGI::FormBuilder::Template::TT2.

CONFIGURATION
    You can set defaults for your forms using Catalyst's config method:

        MyApp->config(form => {
            method     => 'post',
            stylesheet => 1,
            messages   => '/locale/fr_FR/form_messages.txt',
        });

    This accepts the exact same options as FormBuilder's "new()" method
    (which is alot). See CGI::FormBuilder for a full list of options.

    Two special configuration parameters control how this plugin resolves
    form config files:

    form_path
        The path to configuration files. This should be set to an absolute
        path to prevent problems. Within this plugin, it is set to:

            form_path => File::Spec->catfile($c->config->{home}, 'root', 'forms');

        This can be a colon-separated list of directories, if you want to
        specify multiple paths (ie, "/templates1:/template2").

    form_suffix
        The suffix that configuration files have. By default, it is "fb".

    In addition, the following FormBuilder options are automatically set for
    you:

    action
        This is set to the URL for the current action. FormBuilder is
        designed to handle a full request cycle, meaning both rendering and
        submission. If you want to override this, simply use the "$c->form"
        object:

            $c->form->action('/action/url');

        The default setting is "$c->req->path".

    cookies
        Handling these are disabled (use Catalyst).

    debug
        This is set to correspond with Catalyst's debug setting.

    header
        This is disabled. Instead, use Catalyst's header routines.

    params
        This is set to get parameters from Catalyst, using "$c->req". To
        override this, use the "$c->form" object:

            $c->form->params(\%param_hashref);

        Overriding this is not recommended.

    source
        This determines which source file is loaded, to setup your form. By
        default, this is set to the name of the action URL, with ".fb"
        appended. For example, "edit_form()" would be associated with an
        "edit_form.fb" source file.

        To override this, include the path as the argument to the method
        attribute:

            sub edit : Local Form('/books/myEditForm') { }

        If no source file is found, then it is assumed you'll be setting up
        your fields manually. In your controller, you will have to use the
        "$c->form" object to create your fields, validation, and so on.
