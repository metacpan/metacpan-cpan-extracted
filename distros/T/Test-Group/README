DESCRIPTION

This is Test::Group, a companion module to Test::Builder.  It allows
to lump tests and fixture into groups that make sense together.  For
example:

    use Test::More tests => 1;
    use Test::Group;
   
    test "hammering the server" => sub {
        ok(I_can_connect);
        for(1..1000) {
           ok(I_can_make_a_request);
        }
    };

produces

 1..1
 ok 1 - hammering the server

Diagnostics of failed subtests are shown, but successful subtests are
muted. This makes the test output very legible even to the naked eye.

Test::Group has no dependencies besides what is provided in stock Perl
5.8.8. It also works under Perl 5.6.1 and 5.8.x (with dependencies).

Test::Group has been in use in my shop under a different name for
years, and has provided significant productivity improvements over
plain Test::More in test-driven development.

Note that you may want to investigate another CPAN module, Test::Class
by Adrian Howard, which is older and offers a similar feature.  But
being a full-fledged test framework it is also a little bit more
cumbersome to use if all you want to do is to group tests.

INSTALLATION
