Revision history for X11-Muralis
================================

0.10 Sun  6 December 2009
-------------------------
  * Revamp; displayng is done with backends.

0.03 Tue 28 August 2007
-----------------------

  * (28 Aug 2007) feh
  	Re-added in the options for feh.

  * (25 Aug 2007) hsetroot not feh
  	Removed the custom stuff for feh and put in hsetroot stuff instead.
  I didn't like feh, it didn't scale properly.

  * (21 Aug 2007) enable use of feh
  	Because xloadimage doesn't work well with XRender, I added some
  code to enable feh as an alternative displayer.

  * (5 Apr 2007) no todo
  	Removed the TODO file since I am using a different system
  for TODO stuff.

0.02 Sat 11 March 2006
----------------------

  * (11 Mar 2006) unseen option
  	* (11 Mar 2006) the 'unseen' option enables files to be displayed without
  repeat, as it maintains a list of files that have not yet been seen,
  in the ~/.muralis/unseen file.

  * (11 Mar 2006) exclude option
  	* (11 Mar 2006) added 'exclude' option, for excluding matches
  	* (11 Mar 2006) changed 'image_match" to 'is_image' because it was confusing.

  * (11 Mar 2006) match options
  	Replaced the 'dir_match' option with 'match' which will match
  anything; there's now a different way of gettting the list of files.
  Also if you give a filename it will display the first file matching
  that filename string.
  	Added the 'nth' option, which will display the nth matching image.

  * (11 Mar 2006) new list options
  	* (11 Mar 2006) listformat allows the default directories + files listing,
  or if 'fullname' will give just a list of the full names of the image
  files.
  	* (11 Mar 2006) outfile gives the name of an output file for the image listing.
  If none is given, will print the list to STDOUT as usual.

  * (11 Mar 2006) tweaking arguments
  	Moved stuff around so that only global things are set in the "new"
  method, and everything else is properly passed around.
  	Also enabled the muralis script to override the config_dir
  and the regular expression used to decide what is an image file.

  * (11 Mar 2006) removed dependency on ls
  	Used opendir/readdir/closedir instead, keeping this more perl.

  * (11 Mar 2006) improved documentation
  	I'd forgotten how woeful it was.  Now all the options are
  actually described.

0.01 Sun 04 September 2005
--------------------------

  * (4 Sep 2005) tweaking documentation

  * (12 Jul 2005) renamed the module X11:Muralis

  * (12 Jul 2005) workaround Image::Info bug
  	It seems that with some JPEG files, the Image::Info module
  can't cope with them, even though xloadimage can display them
  perfectly well.  So, if Image::Info crashes, this now simply goes
  on to the display part.  This means that for those particular files,
  no smart guessing of the appropriate options will happen, but the
  user can still set their wanted options from the command line.

  * (9 May 2005) fixed tiling options

  * (9 May 2005) initial checkin
