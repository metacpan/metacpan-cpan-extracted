    Mojolicious::Plugin::PDFRenderer - Uses wkhtmltopdf via PDF::WebKit to
    render your app exactly as it looks in Chrome/WebKit but vector
    scalable and in PDF.

VERSION

SYNOPSIS

        package App;
        use Mojo::Base 'Mojolicious';
    
        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;
    
            $self->plugin( 'Mojolicious::Plugin::PDFRenderer', {
                javascript_delay => 1000
                , load_error_handling => 'ignore'
                , page_height => '5in'
                , page_width => '10.5in'
                # options that would otherwise be passed to PDF::WebKit,
                # see `wkhtmltopdf --extended-help` for more (replace dashes w/ underscores)
            } );
            # ...
        }

    Then go to http://yourapp:3000/any/route, take a good look, then go to
