NAME

    Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket - Simple socket transport for
    Test::Reporter

VERSION

    version 1.02

SYNOPSIS

        my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
            transport => 'Socket',
            transport_args => [
              host     => 'metabase.relay.example.com',
              port     => 58008,
            ],
        );
    
        # use space-separated in a CPAN::Reporter config.ini
        transport = Socket host metabase.relay.example.com ...

DESCRIPTION

    This is a Test::Reporter::Transport that sends test report data
    serialised over a TCP socket.

    The idea is to keep dependencies in the tester perl to a bare minimum
    and offload the bulk of submission to a Metabase instance to a relay.

USAGE

    See Test::Reporter and Test::Reporter::Transport for general usage
    information.

 Transport arguments

    Unlike most other Transport classes, this class requires transport
    arguments to be provided as key-value pairs:

        my $report = Test::Reporter->new(
            transport => 'Socket',
            transport_args => [
              host     => 'metabase.relay.example.com',
              port     => 58008,
            ],
        );

    Arguments include:

    host (required)

      The name or IP address of a host where we want to send our serialised
      data.

      This may also be an arrayref of the above. A connection will be
      attempted to each item in turn until a successful connection is made.

    port

      The TCP port on the above host to send our serialised data.

METHODS

    These methods are only for internal use by Test::Reporter.

 new

        my $sender = Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket->new( %params );

    The new method is the object constructor.

 send

        $sender->send( $report );

    The send method transmits the report.
