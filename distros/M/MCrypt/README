This is MCrypt, an XS-based perl interface to the popular mcrypt crypto
library.

MCrypt supports a wide variety of block algorithms such as DES, TripleDES,
Blowfish (default), 3-WAY, SAFER-SK64, SAFER-SK128, TWOFISH, TEA, RC2,
GOST, LOKI, SERPENT, CAST and RIJNDAEL in CBC, OFB, CFB and ECB cipher
modes.


Prerequisites
--------------

In addition to this module, you must install the libmcrypt library. 

Please download and install the latest libmcrypt-2.2.x.tar.gz at
ftp://argeas.cs-net.gr/pub/unix/mcrypt.  At the time of this writing, the
latest 2.2.x release was 2.2.7.

Additional information about the mcrypt library can be found at
http://mcrypt.hellug.gr.

The mcrypt library MUST be found in your library path when using
this module.  In Linux, libmcrypt is defaultly installed in /usr/local/lib
-- be sure that the /usr/local/lib path is in your /etc/ld.so.conf.


Installing MCrypt
-----------------

standard issue:

	1. perl Makefile.PL
	2. make
	3. make test
	4. make install


Notes & Caveats
-----------------

I have only tested this module with Linux only.  I would imagine it will
work on *BSD systems also, as long as libmcrypt is in your library search
path.  Please report any other successful OS/Platform combinations to me.
Thanks.

There may be bugs; please report them to the below address.  I would like 
feedback from users of this module - I may change some things around 
depending on how people plan on using this module.  Constructive criticism 
always welcome from seasoned perl module writers.

This interface is used with the 2.2.x tree of the mcrypt library ONLY!
The newer 2.5.x API is not supported yet; I don't use it myself, but I may
add it in if there is some demand.
