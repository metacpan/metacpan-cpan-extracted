NAME
    Net::TiVo - Perl interface to TiVo.

INSTALLATION
    % perl Makefile.PL 
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

REQUIREMENTS
    XML::Simple
    Log::Log4perl
    LWP::UserAgent

PLATFORMS
    I have tested it on the following platforms, but it should work on any platform
    that runs Perl, and meets the above requirements.
    
    FreeBSD v6.1

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::TiVo;

        my $tivo = Net::TiVo->new(
            host => '192.168.1.25', 
            mac  => 'MEDIA_ACCESS_KEY'
        );

        for ($tivo->folders()) {
            print $_->as_string(), "\n";
        }   

ABSTRACT
    "Net::TiVo" provides an object-oriented interface to TiVo's REST
    interface. This makes it possible to enumerate the folders and shows,
    and dump their meta-data.

DESCRIPTION
    "Net::TiVo" has a very simple interface, and currently only supports the
    enumeration of folder and shows using the REST interface. The main
    purpose of this module was to provide access to the TiVo
    programmatically to automate the process of downloading shows from a
    TiVo.

    "Net::TiVo" does not provide support for downloading from TiVo. There
    are several options available, including LWP, wget, and curl. Note: I
    have used wget version >= 1.10 with success. wget version 1.09 appeared
    to have an issue with TiVo's cookie.

CACHING
    "Net::TiVo" is slow due to the amount of time it takes to fetch data
    from TiVo. This is greatly sped up by using a cache. "Net::TiVo"'s "new"
    method accepts a reference to a "Cache" object. Any type of caching
    object may be supported as long as it meets the requirements below.
    There are several cache implementations available on CPAN, such as
    "Cache::Cache".

    The following example creates a cache that lasts for 600 seconds.

        use Cache::FileCache;
    
        my $cache = Cache::FileCache->new(
             namespace          => 'TiVo',
             default_expires_in => 600,
        }

        my $tivo = Net::TiVo->new(
             host  => '192.168.1.25',
             mac   => 'MEDIA_ACCESS_KEY',
             cache => $cache,
        }

    "Net::TiVo" uses *positive* caching, errors are not stored in the cache.

    Any "Cache" class may be used as long as it supports the following
    method signatures.

        # Set a cache value
        $cache->set($key, $value);

        # Get a cache value
        $cache->get($key);

  METHODS
    folders()
        Returns an array in list context or array reference in scalar
        context containing a list of Net::TiVo::Folder objects.
