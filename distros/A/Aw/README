SPECIAL NOTICE
==============
0.16.0 offers compatibility with Perl 5.6 - 5.8.  The package builds and
the bin/ scripts pass with Perl 5.8 but it is not optimized for 5.8.  Mostly
this impacts better Unicode support in Perl 5.6 and later.  This enhanced
support is not yet taken advantage of in the Aw package.

0.15 introduces the setting and getting event type definitions as hashes.

See bin/typedef-test1.pl and bin/typedef-test2.pl for examples of hash
and typedef usage.  bin/eod-autotest.pl has become a "tour de force" of
sorts of what the package is capable of admin wise and for basic client use.
bin/index.html provides a summary of what each script does.

The mod_perl TicTacToe example is again a part of the distribution, found
in the bin/apache directory.


INTRODUCTION
============
The Aw.pm module provides a Perl interface to the ActiveWorks libraries.
The Perl script writer may instantiate new Perl objects for ActiveWorks
adapters, broker clients, server clients, events, event types, type defs,
etc, with a class hierarchy nearly identical to that of the Java API while
maintaining the expected norms and conveniences of Perl.


Changes
=======
See the "Changes" file provided with each release.


INSTALLATION
============
See the "INSTALL" file.


DOCUMENTATION
=============
POD is forthcoming, see the doc/index.html file for a class and method list.
See also the Java and C CADK manuals of ActiveWorks.


LICENSE
=======
GNU GPL version 2.0 or later.


DISCLAIMERS
===========
In addition to the disclaimers in the GPL: this interface to the ActiveWorks
libraries is NOT in any way endorsed by ActiveSoft or WebMethods.


FEATURES
========
"Events are Hashes, Hashes are Events"

No need to fuss with adapter config files unless you really want to (I don't).


What it Can Do..
--------------
The provided classes and their methods are sufficient to run simple
clients and adapters.  See the scripts in the bin/ directory for examples.

The Aw:: package should be compatible with any Perl system, no limitations
have been encountered.  The package embeds readily in Apache with mod_perl.
See the bin/apache directory for examples.

Works with either ActiveWorks 3.0 or 4.x libraries.  Comment/Uncomment the
appropriate lines in the Makefile.PL.  The package has only been used under
Solaris 2.6 and 8.0 with Perl versions 5.004_04, 5.005_03, 5.6 and 5.8.
Reliability on other systems is unkown.  Please submit any success stories
on other systems.


What it Can't Do..
----------------
Multiple adapters running simultaneously (threaded) in a single script are
not guaranteed to operate sanely.

Not every API that has been mapped into Perl has actually been used.
There will likely be bugs waiting to snip at the first person to invoke
said methods.

Has not been tested against the ActiveWorks 3.1 libraries.


TODO
====

 *  Make sure that it is thread safe when multiple adapters live
    in a single script.
 *  Update for newer breeds of Perl and WebMethods Enterprise Server.


AUTHOR'S COMMENTS
=================
As the Perl slogan goes: "There is more than one way to do it!".
I have certainly found this to be true when working with Perl
primitives for object design.  The initial approach in this
release is to follow the Java API which has the conveniences
of:

  1) Is presumably a well thought out object interface.
  2) Having a design.
  3) It's already documented ;-)
  4) Will look familiar to Java converts.

However the Java API is not always going to be the most natural
to Perl developers and some Perlisms may occasionally be in 
order.  When a Perl shortcut is taken the rule followed is to
provide the shortcut in addition to the Java analog.  This rule
is broken when for how error handling is treated.  No BrokerError
objects are provided.  Instead the Mysql package model is applied.

Finally, the AdapterUtil class is still mysterious in purpose to
me.  In C they seem to be a way to work with callback data
("handles").  In Java there seems to be a bit more to it.  I have
converted some of the routines that expect handles into adapters
methods so the programmer isn't burdened with making implicit
data explicit.  The AdapterUtil class with the same methods is
however provided.


Error Policy
------------
Superimposing the Java API on a Perl API using a C API bore
at least one casualty.  Or enhancement depending on your point
of view.

Like C, Perl does not support the concept of thrown exceptions.
Every Aw Perl method will record broker errors by pointing to
( obj->err ) BrokerErrors returned by the underlying C APIs.
These BrokerError data types are not the default return types
into Perl space.  $! will be set to the value of
awErrorToCompleString starting from the v0.13 release.

Many of the Java methods were "void" in return type while leaving
errors to be detected in the thrown exception.  In such instances
the Perl method will return a boolean  (the "awaBool" type
specifically mapped onto Perl's T_BOOL) to indicate the presence
of errors.  This would be in keeping with other methods that in
both the C and Java APIs do return booleans for success or failure.

Other methods that might return strings or integers likewise set
up error results in the objects error pointer.  In cases where a
new object was the expected return type, an "undef" is returned
on failure.  The cause of the failure may be analyzed by invoking
Aw::Error methods as functions (e.g. $ec = Aw::Error::getCode(); )
or by instantiating a new error object using "last" (vs "new")
$err = last Aw::Error;   In both cases an internal global error
pointer is applied that always points to the last error created
in the XS layer.  Or just check $! as of v0.13.

Classes derived from the Aw::Basic class will have these error
methods available:

	::err  		returns a boolean to indicate the presence of an error.

	::errmsg	returns a string describing the error message equivalent
			to "awErrorToCompleteString".

	::error		returns a Aw::Error object from which addition
			details about the error can be garnered.
