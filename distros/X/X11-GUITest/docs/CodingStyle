This is a short list of coding style guidelines to be used when
developing for this project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
- Utilize language idioms for aspects not covered below.
- Be consistent.
- Write the code for people first, computers second.
- If you are just adding enhancements to an existing
  module and not rewriting it, you should maintain the
  existing coding styles that are in place.

Indentation:
- 4 character indents

Braces/Spacing:

	int func(void)
	{
	}

	if (var) {
		printf("Hello\n");
	}

	while (true) {
	}

Variables:
- Descriptive names for globals or ones that are file scoped.  Mixed
  case is also prefered for these.
- Shorter names can be used for locals.
- Use static and const when appropriate.
- Perl variables should be scoped appropriately.

Functions/Subroutines:
- Utilize mixed case, first character of each word capitalized
- Noun, Verb, etc. ordering of function names should be consistent 
  (i.e., GetThis, SetThat)

Commenting:
- Don't try to explain HOW your code works, rather explain WHY it is
  doing what it does.
- And if you have to explain a lot about your code, consider rewriting
  your code to be easier to follow.
