Text-Sass - A Naieve Perl implementation of Sass & SCSS http://sass-lang.com/
=============================================================================

https://github.com/rmp/libtext-sass-perl

This is most definitely a work-in-progress. It only implements a
subset of the specification but it's being actively developed so if
there's functionality missing, drop me a line at rmp@psyphi.net and
send me patches and tests.

And yes, this should all really be done with a proper language tools,
i.e. grammar, parser, tokeniser etc.

Bugs & Limitations
 - Compound class/id/element are unreliable:
   .element1, .element2
     ...

 - Variables are currently global. This can be quite unpleasant.
 - There is no support for colorfunctions. 
 - There is no support for @extends.
 - No support of default for values.
 - No support for #{} interpolation.
 - No support for @import of sass and scss.
 - No support for @debug.
 - No support for @warn.
 - No support for @if.
 - No support for @for.
 - No support for @while.

Other than that, you're good to go.

Thanks to Bjørn-Olav Strand, Andreas König, Dan Markham, Konstantin Tokarev and others for patches.
