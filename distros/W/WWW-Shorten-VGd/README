NAME

    WWW::Shorten::VGd - Shorten URLs using https://v.gd/

SYNOPSIS

      use strict;
      use warnings;
    
      use WWW::Shorten::VGd;
      # use WWW::Shorten 'VGd';  # or, this way
    
      my $short_url = makeashorterlink('http://www.foo.com/some/long/url');
      my $long_url  = makealongerlink($short_url);

DESCRIPTION

    A Perl interface to the web site https://v.gd/. The service simply
    maintains a database of long URLs, each of which has a unique
    identifier.

    By default, this URL shortening service will show you a preview page
    before redirecting you. This can be turned off by setting a cookie at
    https://v.gd/previews.php.

FUNCTIONS

 makeashorterlink

    The function makeashorterlink will call the https://v.gd/ web site
    passing it your long URL and will return the shorter version.

 makealongerlink

    The function makealongerlink does the reverse. makealongerlink will
    accept as an argument either the full URL or just the identifier.

    If anything goes wrong, then either function will return undef.
