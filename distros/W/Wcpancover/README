SYNOPSIS
     $ wcpancover setup
     $ wcpancover daemon

DESCRIPTION
    Wcpancover is a Perl web apllication.

INSTALLATION
    Wcpancover uses well-tested and widely-used CPAN modules, so
    installation should be as simple as

        $ cpanm Wcpancover

    when using App::cpanminus. Of course you can use your favorite CPAN
    client or install manually by cloning the "SOURCE REPOSITORY".

SETUP
  Environment
    Although most of Wcpancover is controlled by a configuration file, a few
    properties must be set before that file can be read. These properties
    are controlled by the following environment variables.

    "WCPANCOVER_HOME"
        This is the directory where WCpanCover expects additional files.
        These include the configuration file and log files. The default
        value is the current working directory ("cwd").

    "WCPANCOVER_CONFIG"
        This is the full path to a configuration file. The default is a file
        named wcpancover.conf in the "WCPANCOVER_HOME" path, however this
        file need not actually exist, defaults may be used instead. This
        file need not be written by hand, it may be generated by the
        "wcpancover config" command.

  The wcpancover command line application
    WCpanCover installs a command line application, "wcpancover". It
    inherits from the mojo command, but it provides extra functions
    specifically for use with Wcpancover.

   config
     $ wcpancover config [options]

    This command writes a configuration file in your "WCPANCOVER_HOME" path.
    It uses the preset defaults for all values, except that it prompts for a
    secret. This can be any string, however stronger is better. You do not
    need to memorize it or remember it. This secret protects the cookies
    employed by Wcpancover from being tampered with on the client side.

    WCpanCover does not need to be configured, however it is recommended to
    do so to set your application's secret.

    The "--force" option may be passed to overwrite any configuration file
    in the current working directory. The default is to die if such a
    configuration file is found.

   setup
     $ wcpancover setup

    This step is required. Run "wcpancover setup" to setup a database. It
    will use the default DBI settings (SQLite) or whatever is setup in the
    "WCPANCOVER_CONFIG" configuration file.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
     $ wcpancover daemon

    After the database is has been setup, you can run "wcpancover daemon" to
    start the server.

    You may also use morbo (Mojolicious' development server) or hypnotoad
    (Mojolicious' production server). You may even use any other server that
    Mojolicious supports, however for full functionality it must support
    websockets. When doing so you will need to know the full path to the
    "wcpancover" application. A useful recipe might be

     $ hypnotoad `which wcpancover`

    where you may replace "hypnotoad" with your server of choice.

  Logging
    Logging in WCpanCover is the same as in Mojolicious. Messages will be
    printed to "STDERR" unless a directory named log exists in the
    "WCPANCOVER_HOME" path, in which case messages will be logged to a file
    in that directory.
