Amazon::SQS::ProducerConsumer

This module makes it easy to use Amazon's Simple Queue Service to coordinate
worker processes using a producer/consumer pattern in which each process
loops while reading messages from a queues, processes them, and publishes new
messages in other queues to drive the workflow along to other workers.


INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
