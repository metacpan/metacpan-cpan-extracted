OPTIONS

 -remove

    This option can be used to remove specific plugins from the bundle. It
    can be used multiple times.

    Obviously, the default is not to remove any plugins.

    Example:

        ; Remove these two plugins from the bundle
        -remove = CriticTests
        -remove = SynopsisTests

 copy_file, move_file

    If you want to copy or move files out of the build dir and into the
    distribution dir, use these two options to specify those files. Both of
    these options can be specified multiple times.

    The most common reason to use this would be to put automatically
    generated files under version control. For example, Github likes to see
    a README file in your distribution, but if your README file is
    auto-generated during the build, you need to copy each newly-generated
    README file out of its build directory in order for Github to see it.

    If you want to include an auto-generated file in your distribution but
    you don't want to include it in the build, use move_file instead of
    copy_file.

    Example:

        copy_file = README
        move_file = README.pod
        copy_file = README.txt

 release

    This option chooses the type of release to do. The default is 'real,'
    which means "really upload the release to CPAN" (i.e. load the
    UploadToCPAN plugin). You can set it to 'fake,' in which case the
    FakeRelease plugin will be loaded, which simulates the release process
    without actually doing anything. You can also set it to 'none' if you
    do not want this module to load any release plugin, in which case your
    dist.ini file should load a release plugin directly. Any other value
    for this option will be interpreted as a release plugin name to be
    loaded.

    Examples:

        ; Release to CPAN for real (default)
        release = real
        ; For testing, you can do fake releases
        release = fake
        ; Or you can choose no release plugin
        release = none
        ; Or you can specify a specific release plugin.
        release = OtherReleasePlugin

 archive, archive_directory

    If set to true, the archive option copies each released version of the
    module to an archive directory, using the ArchiveRelease plugin. This
    is the default. The name of the archive directory is specified using
    archive_directory, which is releases by default.

    Examples:

        ; archive each release to the "releases" directory
        archive = true
        archive_directory = releases
        ; Or don't archive
        archive = false

 include_dotfiles

    If this is set to true (not the default), then any file that includes a
    leading '.' will be included in the package

    Example:

        include_dotfiles = true

 compile_synopsis

    If this is set to true (the default), then the SynopsisTests plugin
    will be enabled. This plugin checks the perl syntax of the SYNOPSIS
    sections of your modules. Obviously, if your SYNOPSIS section is not
    perl code (case in point: this module), you should set this to false.

    Example:

        compile_synopsis = false

 add_meta

    If this is set to true (the default), then the AutoMetaResources and
    Authority plugins will be enabled. These plugins adds various metatdata
    such as the github repo, cpan links, etc to the metadata of the plugin.

    Example:

        add_meta = false
