NAME
    Algorithm::EquivalenceSets - Group sets transitively

VERSION
    version 1.101420

SYNOPSIS
        use Algorithm::EquivalenceSets;

        my @sets = (
            [ 'a', 1, 2 ],
            [ 'b', 3, 4 ],
            [ 'c', 5    ],
            [ 'd', 1, 6 ],
            [ 'e', 3, 6 ],
            [ 'f', 5, 7 ],
        );

        my @equiv_sets = equivalence_sets(@sets);

        # @equiv_sets is ([ qw(c f 5 7) ], [ qw(a b d e 1 2 3 4 6) ])

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports one function, "equivalence_sets()", which takes a
    list of sets and returns another list of sets whose contents are
    transitively grouped from the input sets.

    Imagine the input sets to be "[ 1, 2 ]", "[ 3, 4 ]", "[ 5, 6 ]" and "[
    1, 3, 7 ]". The returned sets would be "[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]" and "[ 5, 6
    ]", because "[ 1, 2 ]" and "[ 3, 4 ]" are tied together by "[ 1, 3, 7
    ]", but "[ 5, 6 ]" stands on its own. So you could say the returned sets
    represent a kind of transitive union. (Real mathematicians may now flame
    me about the misuse of terminology.)

    Each set is an array reference. The return sets are given as an array in
    list context, or as a reference to that array in scalar context.
