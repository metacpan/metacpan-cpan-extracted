DESCRIPTION
    PseudoPOD is an extended set of POD tags for book manuscripts.
    Standard POD doesn't have all the markup options you might want for
    marking up files for publishing production. PseudoPOD adds a few extra
    tags for footnotes and tables, and has extended uses of "=begin" 
    elements. See Pod::PseudoPod::Tutorial.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

    # or

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
   

USAGE
    The standard installation includes ppod2html and ppod2txt converters
    and a ppodchecker script.

      $ ppod2html filename.pod

    If you copy the sample style.css from the "examples/" directory into
    the same directory as the html files you generate, the output is a
    tolerable simulation of O'Reilly's animal book format.
