=head1 NAME

KinoSearch::Search::Span - An offset, a length, and a weight.

=head1 DEPRECATED

The KinoSearch code base has been assimilated by the Apache L<Lucy> project.
The "KinoSearch" namespace has been deprecated, but development continues
under our new name at our new home: L<http://lucy.apache.org/>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $combined_length = $upper_span->get_length
        + ( $upper_span->get_offset - $lower_span->get_offset );
    my $combined_span = KinoSearch::Search::Span->new(
        offset => $lower_span->get_offset,
        length => $combined_length,
    );
    ...



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Span objects store information about a span across an array of...
something. The unit is context-dependent.

Text is one possibility, in which case offset and length might be measured
in Unicode code points.  However, the Span could also refer to a span
within an array of tokens, for example -- in which case the start and
offset might be measured in token positions.

        weight => 1.0,    # default 0.0
