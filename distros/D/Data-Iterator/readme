	Iterator.pm - shows paths/values of complex data structures

DESCRIPTION

	Iterator.pm is an object orientated (plain) Perl module to
	iterate over complex data structures (LoL, LoH, HoL, HoH etc.).

	While Perl's built-in functions foreach(), each(), keys() and
	values() handle just a given level of a structure, Iterator digs
	deeper - handling a structure like an one-dimensional hash.

	For each element of a nested data structure the symbolic name
	("data path"), The Value - as is! - plus some additional
	information are retrieved.

	That is, Iterator provides an unified syntax for simple handling
	of data sources of different types.

	Iterator does not alter the referenced structure, though values
	may be explicitly modified by the user.

	Iterator does not export any variables or functions. You /can/
	call arbitrary packet subs via &Packetname::subname(), but you
	/might/ be surprised of the results :-)


INSTALLATION

	- Just copy/move Iterator.pm into your Perl's [/site]/lib/Data-
	directory. In your script,

		use Data::Iterator;

	- If you want to keep Iterator.pm in any directory not in @INC,
	BEGIN unshift()ing this dir to @INC or

		use lib 'your/dir/here';

	In your script,

		use Iterator;


METHODS

	(see Iterator's documentation for details.)

	- Data::Iterator->new(\data_structure)

	Takes the reference to a structure (Hash, Array, Scalar, Glob,
	FileHandle, '-File:path/to/file.ext') and returns a blessed hash
	reference (further on known as "$obj"). Returns undef on failure.

	- $obj->cfg()              # (1)
	- Data::Iterator->cfg()    # (2)
	- Data::Iterator::cfg()    # (2)

	Gets/sets the object's configuration (1) or the modules defaults
	(2). The latter will affect new() objects.

	- $obj->element('data path')

	returns information (data path, The Value, plus some more stuff)
	about the current element. Can be used to iterate over the data
	structure passed to new(), or to iterate over a sub-structure (if
	parameter 'data path' is provided)

	Data paths are strings in the form '[1]{key1}{key2}[0]'. Kind of
	stringified Perl data indices.

	- $obj->keys('data path')

	returns an array with all keys (no 'data path' provided) of the
	structure, those of a sub-structure, if 'data path' is present
	(and valid).

	- $obj->values('data path')

	returns an array with all values (no 'data path' provided) of the
	structure, those of a sub-structure, if 'data path' is present
	(and valid).

	- $obj->reset('data path')

	prepares for a new $obj->element()-iteration, if a previous loop
	(e.g. while...) was left before the last element of the structure
	(no data path provided) or of a substructure (data path provided)
	had been reached.
