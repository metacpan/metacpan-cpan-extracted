NAME

    Date::Holidays::TW - Determine whether it is Taiwan Holidays or not.

SYNOPSIS

    This module can be used by itself:

        use Date::Holidays::TW qw(is_tw_holiday);
        if ( is_tw_holiday(2020, 6, 25) ) {
            ...
        }

    Or via Date::Holidays

        my $dh = Date::Holidays->new( countrycode => 'TW' );
        if ($dh->is_holiday( 2020, 6, 25 )) {
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides functions to look into Taiwan holiday calendars
    for known holidays. It could be used by itself, or under via
    Date::Holidays module.

    Caveat: Due to the rule of weekend-compensation and the fact that the
    majority of holidays are defined by Chinese calendar (Lunar), it
    requires some non-trivial amount of computation to correctly determine
    whether the given date is an holiday or not -- which is not implemented
    at this version.

    The current implementation includes all known holidays from year 2013
    and 2024 in a lookup table and should therefore correctly determine
    holidays in those years. It should also determine most of the future
    holidays correctly with some basic compuation, except for the ones
    generated by the weekend-compensation rules, which is somewhat
    ambiguous.

    Conventionally the holiday calendar for the next year is announcend at
    the end of June and we could start to mix the new information into the
    lookup table in this module.

    Generally speaking, queries for far future should be avoided.

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

 is_tw_holiday

    Usage:

        my $holiday_name = is_tw_holiday( $year, $month, $day );

    This subroutine returns the name of the holiday for the given day if it
    is a holiday. Otherwise it returns undef.

 tw_holidays

    Usage:

        my $holidays = tw_holidays( $year );

    This retrieve all Taiwan holidays of given year as a HashRef. With keys
    being Month + Day as 4-digit string and values being the name of the
    corresponding holiday.

METHODS

 is_holiday

    Usage:

        $o = Date::Holidays::TW->new();
        $res = $o->is_holiday( $year, $month, $day );

    This does the same thing as function is_tw_holiday.

 holidays

    Usage:

        $o = Date::Holidays::TW->new();
        $res = $o->holidays( $year );

    This does the same thing as function tw_holidays.
