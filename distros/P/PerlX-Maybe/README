NAME
    PerlX::Maybe - return a pair only if they are both defined

SYNOPSIS
    You once wrote:

     my $bob = Person->new(
        defined $name ? (name => $name) : (),
        defined $age ? (age => $age) : (),
     );

    Now you can write:

     my $bob = Person->new(
        maybe name => $name,
        maybe age  => $age,
     );

DESCRIPTION
    Moose classes (and some other classes) distinguish between an attribute
    being unset and the attribute being set to undef. Supplying a constructor
    arguments like this:

     my $bob = Person->new(
        name => $name,
        age => $age,
     );

    Will result in the `name` and `age` attributes possibly being set to undef
    (if the corresponding $name and $age variables are not defined), which may
    violate the Person class' type constraints.

    (Note: if you are the *author* of the class in question, you can solve
    this using MooseX::UndefTolerant. However, some of us are stuck using
    non-UndefTolerant classes written by third parties.)

    To ensure that the Person constructor does not try to set a name or age at
    all when they are undefined, ugly looking code like this is often used:

     my $bob = Person->new(
        defined $name ? (name => $name) : (),
        defined $age ? (age => $age) : (),
     );

    or:

     my $bob = Person->new(
        (name => $name) x!!(defined $name),
        (age  => $age)  x!!(defined $age),
     );

    A slightly more elegant solution is the `maybe` function.

  Functions
    `maybe $x => $y, @rest`
        This function checks that $x and $y are both defined. If they are, it
        returns them both as a list; otherwise it returns the empty list.

        If @rest is provided, it is unconditionally appended to the end of
        whatever list is returned.

        The combination of these behaviours allows the following very sugary
        syntax to "just work".

         my $bob = Person->new(
                 name      => $name,
                 address   => $addr,
           maybe phone     => $tel,
           maybe email     => $email,
                 unique_id => $id,
         );

        This function is exported by default.

    `provided $condition, $x => $y, @rest`
        Like `maybe` but allows you to use a custom condition expression:

         my $bob = Person->new(
                                     name      => $name,
                                     address   => $addr,
           provided length($tel),    phone     => $tel,
           provided $email =~ /\@/,  email     => $email,
                                     unique_id => $id,
         );

        This function is not exported by default.

    `PerlX::Maybe::IMPLEMENTATION`
        Indicates whether the XS backend PerlX::Maybe::XS was loaded.

  XS Backend
    If you install PerlX::Maybe::XS, a faster XS-based implementation will be
    used instead of the pure Perl functions. My basic benchmarking experiments
    seem to show this to be around 30% faster.

  Environment
    The environment variable `PERLX_MAYBE_IMPLEMENTATION` may be set to "PP"
    to prevent the XS backend from loading.
