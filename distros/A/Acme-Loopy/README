NAME
    Acme::Loopy - loop keyword

SYNOPSIS
            loop {
                    my @row = get_data() or last;
                
                    # First iteration only
                    print table_headers(\@row) unless ${^LOOP};
                
                    # All iterations
                    print table_row(\@row);
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This is really just a test/experiment with Keyword::Simple. It gives you a
    keyword `loop` which acts like a while(1) loop - that is, it loops
    infinitely until an explicit `last`. This is quite similar to ikegami's
    Syntax::Feature::Loop.

    Within the loop, the variable `${^LOOP}` can be used to obtain the current
    iteration count. This is a zero-based count, so is zero (false) on the
    first journey around the loop.

    Keyword::Simple made defining the `loop` keyword itself so easy that
    `${^LOOP}` became the tricky part. (Or rather making it work with nested
    loops did!)
