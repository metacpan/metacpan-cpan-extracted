=head1 NAME

qmail-dmarc - verify using DMARC and queue a mail message for delivery

=head1 DESCRIPTION

qmail-dmarc is designed to be called by qmail-smtpd instead of qmail-queue
and will verify if incoming e-mail conforms to the DMARC policy of its
sender domain.

If it does not and the environment variable DMARC_REJECT is set to a true
value, it will reject the message.

The check will be skipped if the message comes from a relay client.

For further details, see L<Mail::Qmail::Filter::DMARC>.
