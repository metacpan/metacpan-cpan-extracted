ROADMAP Where is Glade::PerlGenerate going?

0.62  Implement any new Glade widgets (eg GnomeDb)

0.64  Glade::Helper GUI options editor and generation control

0.70  Use libxml? Use XML streams or SAX parser ??
0.71  Some communication with Glade and editor (possibly include a builtin)
        This depends on Glade offering the control mechanisms

This is only a rough plan so if you have any good ideas or urgent 
requirements please tell me.
