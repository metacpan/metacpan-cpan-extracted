   in Mesa 9.2.0.  Thanks to Colin Watson for reporting and fixing
   the problem.

Highlights:

  * Tolerate absence of several extensions removed in Mesa 9.2.0

0.6702 2013-10-02

General Notes:

 * This release fixes some minor build issures for Strawberry Perl 32bit
   where the wrong FreeGLUT library would be linked in---this failed at
   runtime during the 'perl Makefile.PL' step.

Highlights:

  * Clean up INSTALL, README, and bring more up-to-date.

  * Put util/strawberry.bat under git configuration management.

  * glutCloseFunc() feature has been disabled.  A warning is given
    the first time the close handler is called.

  * Strawberry perl builds are now detected and the build configuration
    is corrected.  This should allow for automated builds.

0.6701 2013-09-29

General Notes:

 * This is a work-around release to work around a problem with
   segfaults during the glutCloseFunc() processing.  Until a
   real fix is found, the feature has been disabled.

Highlights:

  * glutCloseFunc() feature has been disabled.  A warning is given
    the first time the close handler is called.

  * Strawberry perl builds are now detected and the build configuration
    is corrected.  This should allow for automated builds.

0.67 2013-07-22

General Notes:

 * This is a quick bugfix release to work around a build
   problem for Debian sid on AMD platforms.

Highlights:

  * Comment out failing tests in t/10_opengl_array.t.  Ideally,
    we could replace this implementation with something using
    pdls instead.

  * Some GLUT cleanup for POGL

  * Remove GL_TYPE_RGBA_FLOAT_ATI support.  The sid debian build
    for AMD has problems with this.

0.66_001 2013-06-04
- New example/glxgears.pl ported by Brian Medley (thanks!)
- Removed OS/2 support code (no longer supported)

0.66 2011-07-29

General Notes:

- This test adds skips for some tests from OpenGL::RPN
   under current development avoiding FAILs in automated
   builds due to known problems.

- It is compatible with the Prima GUI toolkit and the
   Prima::OpenGL module.

0.65 2011-07-22

General Notes:

- This is a point release for the Perl OpenGL module (POGL)
   with new features, bugs fixed and improved documentation.

- OS/2 is no longer supported by POGL directly.


Highlights:

- Paul Seamons contributed full tessellation support,
    documentation for OpenGL::Tessellation, and a *major* set
    of fixes and POD for the existing OpenGL::Array module.

- The cygwin build of POGL now supports either the native
    win32 platform drivers or the X11/GLX bindings (default).
    Use interface=w32api or interface=wgl as args to the
    perl Makefile.PL to select.  NOTE: you have to pick one
    or the other.  If you change, any dependencies such as
    PDL::Graphics::TriD will need to be recompiled.

- The included FreeGLUT DLL has been upgraded to 2.6.0
    thanks to Rob/sisyphus.

- Prima::OpenGL has been released by Dmitry Karasik which
    adds support for Perl OpenGL to his cross-platform GUI
    toolkit in addition to bug fixes and code cleanup.
    Thanks, Dmitry!  See http://search.cpan.org/~karasik/Prima-1.30/
    for details.

0.64_004 2011-07-18

General Notes:

- This is a CPAN developers release for the OpenGL module.

   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

   - These release notes may not be fully complete.  Please
     see the git log for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in KNOWN_PROBLEMS.

  Highlights:

- Add META.yml information to the build process

- Fix bug in test.pl

- First POGL code to be placed on new sf.net site.

0.64_003 2011-07-11

  This is a CPAN developers release for the Perl OpenGL module with
  some minor fixes to improve buildability and updates and bug
  fixes to check.

  Highlights:

- Fix interface=w32api to work for cygwin again.  Requires a
    current cygwin install---greater than 1.7.x.

- Minor cleanup in Makefile.PL and documentation/readme updates
    reflecting the newly set up Perl OpenGL project at sf.net:

      http://sourceforge.net/projects/pogl/

0.64_002 2011-03-19

  This is a CPAN developers release for the Perl OpenGL module with
  some minor fixes to improve buildability and updates and bug
  fixes to check.

  Highlights:

- win32 freeglut.dll has been updated to 2.6.0, the
    current stable release.

- Many fixes to OpenGL::Array and new tests for the
    functionality.  Still in progress but more complete
    and correct nonetheless.

0.64_001 2011-03-05

  This is a point release for the Perl OpenGL module with
  some minor fixes to improve buildability.

  Highlights:

- Newly revised GLU tesselation support provided
    by Paul Seamons.  See examples/tesselation.pl
    if you wish to test drive the functionality.

0.64 2010-09-14

- This is a point release for the Perl OpenGL module with
  some minor fixes to improve buildability.

- Add Test::More as a prerequisite for OpenGL
    (it is used by the tests)

- Work around a gcc 3.2.3 optimizer bug which caused
    build failures on some linux systems.

0.63 2010-07-10

- Make glpDisplay() handle all XOpenDisplay input
    argument and return the Display structure pointer.
    This allows glpDisplay to be used to check for
    the ability to open the X display avoiding a
    problem with glutInit exiting when no display
    is found.

- Remove use Math::Trig from test.pl

- Fix typo reported in OpenGL.pod

- Add /usr/local/freeglut/* to Makefile.PL location

0.62 2009-12-27

  Highlights:

- Improved build support for Solaris OpenGL and FreeGLUT libraries.

- Corrected install for win32 DLL.

- Fixed build for AGL to only use AGL, not X11 on Mac OS X.

- Fixed _have_freeglut() checks in test.pl and elsewhere.

- Fix glut_const.h typos that broke some GLUT macros.  Exiting
    the FreeGLUT event loop should work.

0.61_001 2009-11-16

- Developers release to check out fix for FreeGLUT constants
    definitions and some include typos that caused them.  If this
    tests ok on CPAN Testers, it will become the stable release.

- The fix means that exiting the FreeGLUT event loop should work.

0.61 2009-11-09

- FreeGLUT detection has been improved when both glut.h and freeglut.h
    are present on a system.

- Fixed include path problems for glversion on Mac OS X.

- Now builds out of the box on many linux, PC, and Mac OS X systems
    as a result of the move to FreeGLUT/GLUT for GUI operations.

- This is the base release for the upcoming PDL-2.4.5 release with
    refactored 3D graphics using the Perl OpenGL module.

- Improved Mac OS X build support, especially with GLUT (not FreeGLUT)
    and no X11 installed or server running.

- Improved FreeGLUT binding and support for FreeGLUT vs GLUT.
    A number of bugs stomped.

- Improved linux/GLX+X11 build support control although FreeGLUT or
    GLUT(on Mac OS X) is preferred for full functionality.

- Fixed MinGW detection logic for ActivePerl configurations

- Code clean up and bugs fixed.  Many were discovered as a result of
    the reconcilliation with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL requirements.

- A few glp*() functions from PDL were added to POGL and confirmed
    consistent API with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL

- glpcOpenWindow() is deprecated as an external, user visible function.
    The use of glpOpenWindow() is recommended.  It provides the exact
    same set of options and control.

- Various documentation updates.

- The test.pl demo program now works more robustly.

- The mysterious freeglut font ... not found bug has been fixed!
