2.25 2022-08-20
- unchanged from 2.24 which appears to have been deleted from CPAN

2.24  2016-12-27T10:58:00
	- Test with Test::More V 1.001002 rather than V 1.302019, and all tests still pass.
		See RT#115236. Thanx to Kent Fredric for again (sorry!) prompting me over this.
		Lowering the version of Test::More in Makefile.PL is the only change in this version.

2.23  2016-12-21T08:00:00
	- Add no_xxe to XML::Twig instantiation. See RT#118972. Many thanx to Lisa Hare for a
		very well-crafted set of patches provided via github.

2.22  2016-07-19T09:24:00
	- Revert change so we use Test::More instead of Test2::Bundle::Extended.
		See RT#115236. Thanx to ribasushi for this report, and my apologies for not acting sooner.

2.21  2016-05-22T09:21:00
	- Escape a '{' in a regexp in t/foo.t. See RT#114551. Thanx to Slaven Rezic.
	- Fix a typo in a comment, as provided by Gregor Herrmann in RT#111385.
	- See http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html for notes on the
		modernization of the repo.
		This includes updating Makefile.PL and removing Build.PL, MANIFEST and *META.*.
	- Bail out cleanly if 'dot' is not installed. See RT#105575. Thanx Karen Etheridge.
	- Update docs to point to a copy of the Perl licence.
	- Update docs in GraphViz.pm to point to the github repo.
	- Move t/pod.t into xt/author/.

2.20  2015-12-29T08:13:00
	- Merge patch from ntyni via github. This concerned use of defined(@some_array). With thanx.

2.19  2015-11-13T08:30:00
	- No code changes.
	- Accept pull request from Patrice Clement to add the x_deprecated flag to both META.json and
		META.yml. The docs already had various references to 'deprecated', including directing users
		to GraphViz2, so no change is needed there. Thanx Patrice.
	- Add .gitignore to MANIFEST.SKIP.

2.18  2015-05-28T08:43:00
	- All patches to this version are from chrony, via a github pull request. With thanx.
	- Use File::Which on Windows to detect if Graphviz is present.
	- Clean up the code, including Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

2.17  2015-03-30T08:56:00
	- No code changes.
	- Create github repo. This has been done because ribasushi (Peter Rabbitson) has kindly offered
		some patches. Hence I've reversed my policy of encouraging this module to die :-).
	- Update Build.PL and Makefile.PL to point to the repo. None of the pre-reqs were updated.

2.16  2014-08-30T08:25:00
	- Update docs on how to download AT&T's Graphviz.
		Thanx to Alex Becker (see RT#98405).

2.15  2013-11-28T11:23:00
	- Fix double-quote escaping bug in GraphViz's _attributes() method. See RT#90528.
		Many thanx to Smylers for the report.
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

2.14  2012-11-09T16:06:00
	- No code changes.
	- Patch t/foo.t to not assume text appears on specific lines of the output test files.

2.13  2012-11-09T08:27:00
	- No code changes.
	- Re-package distro because users get errors during testing. See RT#80709.
		Since I had this same error during my testing, I assume the uploaded version contains un-patched
		code. The errors are not in GraphViz, they are in the test code which has hard-coded line numbers
		where it looks for strings in the output. The output has been reformatted recently, and no longer
		matches those assumptions. See t/foo.t for details. Note: I did not write those tests :-).

2.12  2012-11-08T12:38:00
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.

2.11  2012-09-18T08:22:00
	- Add VDX as an output format.

2.10  2012-03-26T10:11:00
	- Accept a patch kindly supplied by Alexander Kriegisch, to change handling of the rankdir attribute.
		The valid values are BT, LR, RL or TB, or their lower-case equivalents.
		Previously, only a true value was accepted, which meant LR. Now, any value not in that list defaults to LR.
		Files changed: README, CHANGES, Changelog.ini, GraphViz.pm, GraphViz/Regex.pm and simple.t.
	- Patch this file to replace BST with GMT, since both DateTime::Format::HTTP and DateTime::Format::Strptime
		fail to recognize BST.
		These modules are used by Module::Metadata::Changes to transform this file into Changelog.ini.

2.09  2011-12-15T11:08:00
	  - Adopt Flavio Poletti's suggestion of trying to pipe to dot, in Build.PL/Makefile.PL, rather than using File::Which,
	  	to see if dot (Graphviz) is installed. This (hopefully) solves the problem of using File::Which on systems where it is
		not installed, before Build.PL/Makefile.PL has a chance to tell the user that File::Which is required. See: RT#73077.

2.08 Tue Nov  1 10:55:00 2011
	 - Wind back pre-reqs for various modules to match what was shipped with Perl V 5.8.1.
	   Many thanx to Brian Cassidy for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72068.

2.07 Sun Oct 30 16:08:00 2011
	 - Rewrite Build.PL and Makefile.PL to try loading File::Which rather than assuming it is installed.
	   This avoids the chicken-and-egg problem whereby these 2 programs need File::Which::which to find 'dot'.
	   Many thanx to Richard Clamp for the error report: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71971.

2.06 Tue Oct 25 08:09:00 2011
	 - Add File::Which to the pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

2.05 Thu Oct 20 10:52:00 2011
	 - Add 'Deprecated. See GraphViz2' to the docs.
	 - Add Build.PL.
	 - Add ability to set ORIENTATION. Thanx to Christian Lackas for the patch. See RT#71787.
	 - Add Changelog.ini.
	 - Add META.json, MYMETA.json and MYMETA.yml.
	 - Add MANIFEST.SKIP.
	 - Ensure all modules contain a version number.
	 - Update the docs regarding the list of modules shipped in this distro.
	 - Remove examples/remote.pl because GraphViz::Remote is no longer shipped.
	 - Clean up examples/clusters2.pl.
	 - Clean up Makefile.PL.

        - thanks to Ron Savage, patched to work under systems
          which have an executable extension, such as Windows

1.9 Tue Aug 24 15:30:31 GMT 2004
	- check for "dot" in the Makefile.PL instead of a test, as
	  suggested by Autrijus Tang
	- renamed Changes to CHANGES
	- clusters can now take attributes as a hashref, thanks to
	  patch from Richard A.Wells (see clusters2.pl)
	- fix docbug in GraphViz::Parse::Yapp (spotted by Mark Fowler)
	- better quoting (patch by Barrie Slaymaker)
	- document as_debug (suggested by Richard Clamp)

1.4 Wed Oct  3 07:57:42 GMT 2001
	- added new filehandle, scalar reference, and code reference
	  scheme to as_* to allow streaming of data, rather than
	  accumulating potentially very large output in memory (based
	  on patch by Dave Rolsky)
	- new pagewidth and pageheight graph attributes for creating
	  PostScript mosaics of large graphs (idea by Nelson Loyola)

1.3 Sun Aug 19 15:43:02 GMT 2001
	- labels can now contain quotes
	- fixed bug: labels can now start with a number
	- fixed bug in Devel::GraphVizProf so that packages
	  are now grouped seperately (lines with the same text used to
	  be grouped together)
	- fixed undefined warning in GraphViz::Parse::RecDescent
	- increased coverage of tests
	- new 'rank' node attribute allows nodes to be ranked
          at the same level

	  Devel::GraphVizProf
	- put the entire Perl regular expression test suite through
	  GraphViz::Regex and fixed all the bugs
        - no longer sort nodes by default (idea by Stephen Riehm),
          which makes graphs just work better. Not documented, do
          you want it to be?

0.14 Thu May  3 17:57:57 GMT 2001
	- added support for InterpLit node in RecDescent grammars
	- added cumulative effect for node attributes (patch by Diego
	  Zamboni)
	- changed the quoting rules again to make it easier to read

          no longer require Perl 5.6
	- moved all modules into a new 'lib' directory (and updated
	  examples) so that Devel::GraphVizProf gets installed
	- new 'concentrate' graph attribute to merge edges in
	  cluttered directed graphs
	- new 'random_start' graph attribute, which requests an
	  initial random placement for the graph
	- new 'epsilon' graph attribute, which decides how long the
	  graph solver tries before finding a graph layout, requested
	  by Pierre-Yves Genot
	- an empty cluster now means not clustered
	- added GraphViz::Regex and example regexp.pl which visualises
	  a regular expression
	- now an award-winning module!

0.12 Tue Mar  6 17:37:21 GMT 2001
	- fixed bug in redcarpet.pl example
	- new rankdir graph attribute, which controls the direction
	  the nodes are linked together (patch by Mark Fowler)

	- new module Data::GraphViz (and example) for graphing data
	  structures
	- new example ppmgraph.pl by Marcel Grunauer which graphs CPAN
	  tarball dependencies using ActiveState's package list (thanks
	  to Brian Ingerson too ;-)
	- new, better, testsuite
	- better quoting (especially in ports) to allow a greater range
	  of characters

	really wierd names)
	- new examples directory with xref.pl: "graphing subroutine
	cross-reference reports for Perl modules" and example graph to
	see what kind of things it can do

0.05 Wed Aug 18 13:12:25 2000
	- now use dotneato to layout the graphs and can now ouput in a
	variety of file formats
