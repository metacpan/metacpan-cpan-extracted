NAME
    DBIx::Iterator - Query your database using iterators and save memory

VERSION
    version 0.0.2

SYNOPSIS
        # Create an iterator for a simple DBI query
        my $db = DBIx::Iterator->new( DBI->connect('...') );
        my $it = $db->query("SELECT id, name FROM person");
        while ( my $row = $it->() ) {
            say $row->{'id'} . ": " . $row->{'name'};
            # Do something with $row...
        }

        # We have a basic class here that knows nothing about iterators
        package Person;
        use Moose;

        has 'id'   => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Int' );
        has 'name' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str' );

        sub label {
            my ($self) = @_;
            return $self->id . ": " . $self->name;
        }

        # Then we have a role that knows how to create instances
        # from iterators
        package FromIterator;
        use Moose::Role;

        sub new_from_iterator {
            my ($self, $it) = @_;
            return sub {
                my $row = $it->();
                return unless defined $row;
                return $self->new($row);
            }
        }

        # Then we apply the role to the Person class and use
        # our plain database iterator that produces hashes to
        # now create Person instances instead.

        package main;
        use Moose::util qw(apply_all_roles);
        my $p = apply_all_roles('Person', 'FromIterator');
        my $it = $p->new_from_iterator(
            $db->query("SELECT * FROM person")
        );
        while ( my $person = $it->() ) {
            say $person->label;
            # Do something with $person...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Iterators are a nice way to perform operations on large datasets without
    having to keep all of the data you're working on in memory at the same
    time. Most people have experience with iterators already from working
    with filehandles. They are basically iterators hidden behind a somewhat
    odd syntax. This module gives you the same way of executing database
    queries.

    The trivial example at the start of the synopsis is not very different
    from using "fetchrow_hashref" in DBI directly to retrieve your database
    rows. But when we look at the second example we can start to see how it
    allows much cleaner separation of concerns without having to modify the
    core class (Person) to support iterators or database interaction at all.

    For more information about iterators and how they can work for you, have
    a look at chapter 4 in the book Higher-Order Perl mentioned below. It is
    free to download and highly recommended.

METHODS
  new($dbh)
    Creates a new iterator factory connected to the specified database
    handle.

  dbh
    Returns the database handle provided to new().

  prepare($query)
    Asks the database engine to parse the query and return a statement
    object that can be used to execute the query with optional parameters.

  query($query, @placeholder_values)
    Executes the query with the optional placeholder values. Returns a code
    reference you can execute until it is exhausted. If called in list
    context, it will also return a reference to the statement object itself.
    The iterator returns exactly what "fetchrow_hashref" in DBI returns.
    When the iterator is exhausted it will return undef.
