NAME
    App::MultiModule - Framework to intelligently manage many parallel tasks

WARNING
    This is a very early release. That means it has a whole pile of
    technical debt. One clear example is that, at this point, this
    distribution doesn't even try to function on any OS except Linux.

    rare to use this module directly.

            $self->{my_counter}++;
            open my $fh, '>>', '/tmp/my_logf';
            print $fh $args{module} . ':' . $self->{my_counter}, "\n";
            close $fh;
            exit if $self->{my_counter} > 60;
