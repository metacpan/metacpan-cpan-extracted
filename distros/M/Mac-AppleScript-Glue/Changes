        - removed usage of osascript(1) and replaced it with Dan
          Sugalski's Mac::AppleScript, which does the same thing but
          better and faster (you'll need to install Mac::AppleScript
          first, from CPAN)

        - simplified the notation of constants and simple
          object-references -- instead of passing a reference to a
          string (\'true'), now you can pass a string enclosed in
          angle-brackets ('<true>') and it will be passed along
          verbatim to AppleScript

        - added an alternate calling form to
          Mac::AppleScript::Object->objref(), in which you can pass
          a pair of class and parameters (file => "foo") instead of
          having to clump it all into one string ("file => \"foo\"")

        - added the option to specify a remote machine when creating a
          Mac::AppleScript::Application object (uses an "eppc:" URL)

        - removed the SCRIPT_RESULT and EXEC debugging tags; now the
          SCRIPT tag debugs both the script and the result, and EXEC
          is unneeded since we don't exec osascript(1) anymore

        - tried to make the AppleScript a little less verbose, since
          it seems that Adobe InDesign has problems with
          object-references that are too complicated

        - fixed the internal number-recognizer so that "5.5.5" isn't
          thought to be a valid number ;)

        - cleaned up a bunch of the examples in "scripts/"

        - added a pod-tester to the test suite, as seen in brian d
          foy's Mac::iTunes

        - added pre-requisites to the Makefile

        - added copyright info

        - various fixes to the POD documentation for clarity, etc.

        - renamed to Mac::AppleScript::Glue, so as play nicely with
          other modules being written
