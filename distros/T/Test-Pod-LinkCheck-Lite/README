Test-Pod-LinkCheck-Lite is Copyright (C) 2019-2022 by Thomas R. Wyant, III

DESCRIPTION

This Perl module tests POD links. A given file generates one failure for
each broken link found. If no broken links are found, one passing test
is done.

INSTALLATION

This module is best installed using your favorite CPAN client: cpan,
cpanp, or cpanm. ActivePerl users can try their ppm.

Failing that, you can use one of the two usual incantations:

    gunzip Test-Pod-LinkCheck-Lite-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Test-Pod-LinkCheck-Lite-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    gunzip Test-Pod-LinkCheck-Lite-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Test-Pod-LinkCheck-Lite-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
SpaceTrack.pm and the SpaceTrack folder into the Astro directory
(creating it if necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC
directories.
