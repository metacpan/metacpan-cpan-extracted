AlignmentSet version 1.1
========================

    This module is a Tools Library to manage an Alignment Set, i.e. a set of sentences aligned at the word (or phrase) level. It provides methods to display the links, to apply a function to each alignment of the set, to evaluate the alignments against a reference, and more. One of the objectives of the module is to allow the user to perform all these operations without bothering with the particular physical format of the Alignment Set. Anyway it also provides format conversion methods.

PREREQUISITES

- Perl 5.005 (or a more recent version)
- The following CPAN modules and libraries (available from www.cpan.org):
   * Pod::Usage (included in the Perl library, in the recent Perl versions) 

INSTALLATION

Extract the tar ball (or copy the extracted Lingua-AlignmentSet-xx directory) where you want to keep the reference pdf file, the sample code file and the command-line tools.

Then to install the library modules go into the Lingua-AlignmentSet-xx directory and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To install the modules in a custom directory add the PREFIX and/or LIB tags. For example:

   perl Makefile.PL LIB=/your/lib/path 

will specify '/your/lib/path' as the installation directory for the modules
(to use the modules, make sure you have this path in your PERL5LIB environment variable).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

See the detailed documentation in docs/reference.pdf (out of date:  Read the ./bin/*.pl manuals instead, with -man option).

You may use the command-line utilities in the bin/ directory or include directly the library calls in a perl script. Look at code examples in the bin/sampleCode.pl program (out of date: instead, look at the examples in the ./bin/*.pl manuals with -man option).
