NAME

    sshss - Use your preferred shell and own home directory for shared SSH
    accounts

VERSION

    Version 0.006

SYNOPSIS

    sshss [shell]

DESCRIPTION

    sshss adds support to ease the pain of these dreadful shared accounts
    prevalent at some organizations. All you have to do is add sshss to the
    command string of the authorized_keys file. sshss lets you define a
    different shell then the one defined in the passwd database for the
    shared account and lets you define a different directory as your home
    directory. You are most likely going to use a subdirectory of the
    shared accounts home directory.

    Both features, the personal home directory and the shell change, can be
    used independently without using the other.

    If you specify a new shell the shell is not only used as the
    interactive shell but also if you directly run a command. This includes
    commands that run over SSH like scp(1) and rsync(1). It's your
    responsibility to not use an overly obscure shell that breaks these
    commands.

    The used shell must support the -c flag to run a command, which is used
    if you run a command directly over SSH, including scp(1) and rsync(1).
    This is the default used by SSH itself. If your shell would work with
    plain SSH, it should also work with sshss.

    sshss tries to behave as much as possible like the do_child function
    from session.c from OpenSSH portable.

    sshss uses no non-core modules.

OPTIONS

    shell

      Specifies the shell to be used instead of the one specified in the
      passwd database.

      This can be used to overwrite the shell configured for a shared
      account. It can also be used to change the shell for your personal
      account if your organization does not have a supported way to change
      your shell.

      If the shell is omitted, sshss uses the default shell for the account
      from the passwd database.

      If the specified shell is not an absolute path, sshss uses the
      default shell for the account from the passwd database.

EXIT STATUS

    sshss exits 1 if an error occurs until it can exec the shell. After the
    exec the exit status depends on the executed shell or the command run
    in this shell.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Change the shell to ksh93 and use a custom home directory

    Create a directory to contain your own home directory. We create the
    directory ~/.ryah in this example. Create a .ssh directory in your new
    custom home directory and add the sshss script to this directory. Add
    the following command string in front of your SSH key in the
    ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

      command=".ryah/.ssh/sshss /usr/bin/ksh93"

    When you login over SSH with your key to the admin account,

      * your shell will be /usr/bin/ksh93, started as login shell

      * the SHELL environment variable will be set to /usr/bin/ksh93

      * the HOME environment variable will be set to /home/admin/.ryah (The
      shared accounts home directory is /home/admin in this example)

      * the working directory will be /home/admin/.ryah (The shared
      accounts home directory is /home/admin in this example)

 Example 2 Change the shell to ksh93 without changing the home directory

    Add the sshss script to e.g. the ~/.ssh directory or any other
    directory. sshss only changes the home directory if it is run from
    inside a .ssh directory outside of the current home directory.

    Add the following command string in front of your SSH key in the
    ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

      command=".ssh/sshss /usr/bin/ksh93"

    When you login over SSH with your key to the admin account,

      * your shell will be /usr/bin/ksh93, started as login shell

      * the SHELL environment variable will be set to /usr/bin/ksh93

 Example 3 Use a custom home directory

    Create a directory to contain your own home directory. We create the
    directory ~/.ryah in this example. Create a .ssh directory in your new
    custom home directory and add the sshss script to this directory. Add
    the following command string in front of your SSH key in the
    ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

      command=".ryah/.ssh/sshss"

    When you login over SSH with your key to the admin account,

      * your shell will be the shell defined in the passwd database,
      started as login shell. If the shell specified in the passwd database
      is empty or invalid, /bin/sh is used instead.

      * the SHELL environment variable will be set to the shell defined in
      the passwd database. If the shell specified in the passwd database is
      empty or invalid, the SHELL environment variable is set to /bin/sh
      instead.

      * the HOME environment variable will be set to /home/admin/.ryah (The
      shared accounts home directory is /home/admin in this example)

      * the working directory will be /home/admin/.ryah (The shared
      accounts home directory is /home/admin in this example)

ENVIRONMENT

    HOME

      If sshss is placed in an .ssh directory, the HOME environment
      variable is set to the parent directory of this .ssh directory. Then,
      the working directory is changed to this new home directory.

      Otherwise the HOME environment variable is not used, nor is the
      working directory changed.

    SHELL

      The environment variable SHELL is set to the shell that is either
      used as interactive shell or that is used to execute the command.
