NAME
    Minion::Backend::Pg91 - PostgreSQL 9.1 backend

SYNOPSIS
      use Minion::Backend::Pg91;

      my $backend = Minion::Backend::Pg91->new('postgresql://postgres@/test');

DESCRIPTION
    Minion::Backend::Pg91 is a backend for Minion based on
    Minion::Backend::Pg . All necessary tables will be created automatically
    with a set of migrations named `minion'. Note that this backend only
    supports PostgreSQL 9.1.

ATTRIBUTES
    Minion::Backend::Pg91 inherits all attributes from Minion::Backend and
    implements the following new ones.

  pg
      my $pg   = $backend->pg;
      $backend = $backend->pg(Mojo::Pg->new);

    Mojo::Pg object used to store all data.

METHODS
    Minion::Backend::Pg91 inherits all methods from Minion::Backend and
    implements the following new ones.
