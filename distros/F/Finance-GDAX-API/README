The module Finance::GDAX::API attempts to implement the crypto
currency trading API of the GDAX exhange as published at

https://docs.gdax.com/

At the time of writing on 24-Jun-2017 all documented REST points have
been implemented.

This is a very low level implementation of the API, just to get the
structure in place.

OVERVIEW
========

The Finance::GDAX::API modules all match up to the sections in the
GDAX API documentation.

The only exceptions are Finance::GDAX::API (from which all the
implementation classes inherit) and Finance::GDAX::API::UR These two
modules handle the mechanics of the API requests.

SECURITY
========

GDAX requires cryptographic API keys for user accounts which are
generated within the user's account at GDAX.

All API requests *MUST* set the 3 API key attributes, "key", "secret"
and "passphrase", which are generated for you at GDAX and which you
must keep secret.

As a convience, the default values for these attributes will be
automatically set for you if you have the corresponding environment
variables set: "GDAX_API_KEY", "GDAX_API_SECRET" and
"GDAX_API_PASSPHRASE".

Also, by default, ALL REQUESTS ARE MARKED "DEBUG" so that no real data
will be used, and their sandbox will be used instead. In order to use
real data, YOU MUST SET DEBUG TO 0 TO WORK WITH REAL DATA. Please note
that you need a completely different set of GDAX API keys for their
debug sandbox, which is generated at their sandbox site.

IN A NUTSHELL
=============

Suppose you want a list of all your GDAX account info/balances, and
you have set your 3 environment variables to your API keys.

use Finance::GDAX::API::Account;

my $account = Finance::GDAX::API::Account->new( debug => 0 );
my $list    = $account->get_all;

At this point, $list will be an array that looks like:

  [
      {
          "id": "71452118-efc7-4cc4-8780-a5e22d4baa53",
          "currency": "BTC",
          "balance": "0.0000000000000000",
          "available": "0.0000000000000000",
          "hold": "0.0000000000000000",
          "profile_id": "75da88c5-05bf-4f54-bc85-5c775bd68254"
      },
      {
          "id": "e316cb9a-0808-4fd7-8914-97829c1925de",
          "currency": "USD",
          "balance": "80.2301373066930000",
          "available": "79.2266348066930000",
          "hold": "1.0035025000000000",
          "profile_id": "75da88c5-05bf-4f54-bc85-5c775bd68254"
      }
  ]

These are all documented in the POD of each API implementation module.

If you do not want you API keys set in environment variables, you must
set the attributes, which are inherited into each API module. As our
example above:

my $account = Finance::GDAX::API::Account->new( debug => 0 );
$account->key($my_key);
$account->secret($my_secret);
$account->passphrase($my_passphrase);

(Or set them in the "new" constructor along with debug => 0)

MORE SECURITY
=============

There is another convenience method inherited into all API modules for
the variously paranoid called "external_secret" which is documented in
Finance::GDAX::API

This method will take a file name and read it in to assigns the 3 API
keys necessary for requests that was assigned to you by GDAX.

It will also optionally fork a process that will read from an external
program that you might set up to handle your own key storage
technology, and just accept the values via STDIN.

TESTING
=======

If your GDAX API key environment variables are set, some live network
tests will be performed using those keys. Tests always run with debug
set, to use the sandbox, so you must make sure you are setting your
sanbox API keys if you want to run network tests.

You can also set GDAX_EXTERNAL_SECRET to be a file to read the keys
from for testing, or you can use GDAX_EXTERNAL_SECRET_FORK and give an
executable command that will return the keys via STDIN.

TODO
====

Some of the long informational requests to GDAX have a paging aspect
if they returned records exceed 100. This implementation of the API
does not yet support paged records. Best to limit by time for now.
