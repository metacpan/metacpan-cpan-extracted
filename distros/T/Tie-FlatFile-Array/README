Tie-FlatFile-Array version 0.05
===============================

Tie::FlatFile::Array allows the programmer to treat a
binary, packed flatfile database as an array of arrays.
For example, see this:

    use Tie::FlatFile::Array;
    use Fcntl;

    tie @flat, 'Tie::FlatFile::Array', 'data.file',
	    O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0644, { packformat => 'A30L' };
    
    @flat = (
	    [www.yahoo.com => 3601],
	    [www.google.com => 5214]
	    );

    untie @flat;

"A30L" is the "pack" format that is used to convert array
references to binary strings. These strings are then written
into the appropriate locations in "data.file."

See the POD for more details.
