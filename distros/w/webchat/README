This package contains the 'webchatpp' program, with its support
modules WWW::Chat, WWW::Chat::Processor and HTML::Form.

The 'webchatpp' program is a preprocessor that turns chat scripts into
plain perl scripts using libwww-perl.  When the script created by
webchatpp is feed to perl it will perform the chatting.  Chat scripts
are useful for setting up test suites for web applications or just to
automate dialogues with web applications.

This is an example of a simple chat script:

  GET http://www.altavista.com
  EXPECT OK
  F q=Gisle
  CLICK
  EXPECT OK && /Gisle Aas/

You can run it like this (assuming script found in file 'av.wc'):

  webchatpp av.wc | perl

Installation as usual; 'perl Makefile.PL; make install', and further
documentation is embedded in the modules and the webchatpp script.

The preprocessing is performed by WWW::Chat::Processor::parse 
function and as such you can use this to parse scripts within 
your own scripts and modules and eval them inline. 

This module is now maintained by Simon Wistow.
