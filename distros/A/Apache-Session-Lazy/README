Apache/Session/Lazy version 0.05
================================

This is Apache::Session::Lazy.
It is an extension of Apache::Session.

Apache::Session is a persistence framework which is particularly useful
for tracking session data between httpd requests.  Apache::Session is
designed to work with Apache and mod_perl, but it should work under
CGI and other web servers, and it also works outside of a web server
altogether.

Apache::Session::Lazy extends Apache::Session by opening Sessions only after they are either
modified or examined (first read or write access to the tied hash.)  It should provide
transparent access to the session hash at all times.
