# Changes for Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion

0.54 - Thu Jan  1 18:28:32 EST 2015
	* Cut this module loose into the desert. If you want to maintain
	this module, write to modules@perl.org.

0.53 - Wed Jan 16 04:43:34 2008
	* Cleanups for the move from CVS to SVN. No need to upgrade.

0.52 - Thu Jan 25 14:34:53 2007

0.51 - Thu Jan 25 14:32:46 2007
	* fix the last distro which had a bad pattern in MANIFEST.SKIP which
	prevented MANIFEST from making it into the directory.

0.51 - Wed Jan 10 18:34:57 2007
	* bumped to a release version

0.50_03 - Fri Mar 11 22:28:59 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests, fixed issues
	* No code fixes: no need to update

0.50_02 - Sun Aug 29 15:35:32 2004
	* Added support for all the record fields I documented.  Oops.

0.50_01 - Sun Aug 29 15:08:50 2004
	* This is an initial, alpha, developer, not-done-yet release
	* I can read the "Companion Waypoints.pdb" file, I just can't write
	it yet
	* I'm using a Magellan GPS Companion with my Visor Edge.  That's
	all I have to test with
	* I have to transfer the file from the Palm to my laptop before
	I can read it: I can't read it directly from the Palm (wouldn't
	that be nice?)
