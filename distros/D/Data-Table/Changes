Revision history for Perl extension Data::Table.

1.75 Sat Apr 23 13:52:25 PDT 2016
  Patch parseCSV(). It returns incorrect columns when delimiter is space and has empty fields
  Thanks to Jeff Janes for the fix.

1.74 Sun Mar 20 20:26:33 PDT 2016
  Add wiki() and wiki2() return table in wikitable string
  Suggested by Ruben Moretti

  Modify html(), html2(), wiki(), wiki2() to support callback function,
    which allows find control of tags within each individual cell
  Passing color array ["","",""] will disable default color scheme.

1.73 Thu Mar  3 20:34:46 PST 2016
  Some mionor typos in the document fixed. No code change.
  Thanks to Lucas Kanashiro

1.72 Wed Apr 29 22:43:13 PDT 2015
  No change to actual code Table.pm
  Just comment out "Guess Windows file format" from t/test1.t, as Strawberry Perl swallows \r
  and fails the test, however, this does not affect it to use the package

1.71
  Fixed a minor bug in rename(), where the old name was not complete deleted.
  The bug was triggered in rowMerge(byName=>1) + a very special situations.
  Also fixed several typos in the test code.

  A special thank to Alexandr Ciornii for help prepare new Makefile.PL,
  as well as create better test files.

1.70 Sat Jan 25 06:44:12 PST 2014
  Minor patch to 1.69, as encoding function is only reliably supported by Perl newer than v5.8.1.
  Patch internal method openFileWithEncoding(), so that older Perl version will not give an error.

  Fixed a warning in fromFileGuessOS, introduced in 1.69.

1.69 Tue Jan 14 10:22:19 PST 2014

  Fix a minor bug in pivot() related to colToSplitIsStringOrNumeric.

  Integer column names are allowed. However, fromFile by default does not take numeric
  column names, unless allowNumericHeader is set to 1.
  Patch fromFile(), checkHeader(), colIndex(), fromFileIsHeader(), fromFileGetTopLines()
  to support numeric column header.
  An integer is first interpreted as a column name. Therefore, accessing a column by its
  ordinal number may not be possible, if the number is used as a column name. In such case,
  first fetch the corresponding column name and access by name.

  Support file encoding methods in fromFile, fromCSV, fromTSV.
  E.g., fromCSV("filename, 1, undef, {encoding=> 'UTF-8'})
  UTF-8 is the default encoding, can be controlled by $Data::Table::DEFAULTS{ENCODING}.
  Thanks to questions asked by Sergio Basto and Thomas Hofmann.

  If an integer is passed to colIndex(), it is interpreted as string first for column lookup.
  fromFile by default will allow numeric headers (but not all column headers can be numeric).

  support skip_empty in melt();

1.68 Mon Aug  6 22:22:22 PDT 2012

  Patch fromFileGetTopLines() and fromFileIsHeader(), which are used by fromFile(). Impact: minor.
  Improve performance of fromFileGuessOS()
  Improve fromFile(), fromCSV(), csv() to support using \r, \n within a CSV field.
  
  join() now supports {matchNULL => 1, NULLasEmpty => 1}, if one would like to treat NULL as empty string, or
  treat NULL as equal (however, not equal to empty string). Both are set to 0 by default.
  Suggested by Kyle Horton & Wilson Dave.

  Remove inheritance from AutoLoader and Exporter.
  Thanks to Brian Wightman

  Thanks to Nicholas Andonakis for sharing his code, quite a few ideas in his package inspired the improvements below!

  Add new shortcut methods: lastRow(), lastCol(), colName($colNumericIndex)
    One can now write
      foreach my $i (0..$t->lastRow)
    instead of
      foreach my $i (0..$t->nofRow-1)

  Add iterator(), so that one can now write
    my $next = $t_product->iterator();
    while (my $row = $next->()) {
      # have access to a row as a hash reference, access row number by &$next(1);
      $t_product->setElm($next->(1), 'ProductName', 'New! '.$row->{ProductName});
    }

  addCol() can take the default value for the new column (first argument)
  addRow() supports {addNewCol => 1}
  moveCol() can take a $newColName.

  setElm() can set a value for multiple cells, specified by ref to row array and col array
  match_string(), match_pattern(), match_pattern_hash() also produce $parentTable->{MATCH}

    # match returns all matched row ids in $t_product->{MATCH} (ref to row ID array)
    $t_product->match_pattern_hash('$_{UnitPrice} > 20');
    # create a new column, with 'No' as the default value
    $t_product->addCol('No', 'IsExpensive');
    # use $t_product->{MATCH} to set values for multiple Elements
    $t_product->setElm($t_product->{MATCH}, 'IsExpensive', 'Yes');

1.67 Wed Jul 25 11:47:23 PDT 2012
  Update Change.txt file to point out $keepRestCol defaults to 1 is only for group()
  For pivot(), $keepRestCol is still default to 0 as before.

1.66 Wed Jul 25 11:03:29 PDT 2012
  Change the default value of keepRestCol in group() to 1, instead of 0 to be compatible with older versions
  Thanks to Kyle Horton

1.65 Mon Jul 23 20:16:08 PDT 2012
  Finish the "Perl Data::Table Cookbook", should be a good learning material.
  To download, visit https://sites.google.com/site/easydatabase/

  Polish Data::Table::Excel for CPAN upload.

  Minor patches to the code.

1.64 Sun Jul  8 22:01:17 PDT 2012
  Add $keepRestCols to Data::Table::group();
  We introduce new constants for fromCSV/fromTSV/fromFile/csv/tsv.
    Data::Table::OS_UNIX = 0;
    Data::Table::OS_PC = 1;
    Data::Table::OS_MAC = 2;
  Add method reorder(), redefine column orders
  Add method melt() and cast(), concept borrowed from Reshape package in R
  Add method each_group(), so one can apply a custom method to rows sharing the same key

  Made a seemingly backward incompatible change to pivot()
    pivot($colToSplit, $colToSplitIsNumeric, ...) is changed to
    pivot($colToSplit, $colToSplitIsStringOrNumber, ...)
  What is now pivot($colToSplit, $Data::Table::STRING, ...), where Data::Table::STRING has a value of 1,
  was equivalent to pivot($colToSplit, 0, ...) in <= 1.63. 
  However, the $colToSplitIsStringOrNumber is now auto-guessed within the code, so the change is not very relevant.
  Most existing code should run fine, without change.

  Patch group(), piviot() to distinguish keys between empty string and undef.

  Patch subTable() to take row mask array when {useRowMask=>1} is provided.

1.63 Tue Jun 12 17:05:43 PDT 2012
  In this release, we patch addCol, delCol, addRow, rowMerge, colMerge to for an empty table
  We introduce new methods isEmpty(), hasCol(), moveCol($colID, $newColIdx)
  We introduce new constants for Data::Table::new()
    Data::Table::ROW_BASED
    Data::Table::COL_BASED

1.62 Fri May 25 11:40:09 PDT 2012
  In this release, we address a few pain points

  Data::Table::colMerge, update to support new options
    { renameCol => 1}
    If specified, duplicate column names in the second table is automatically renamed (by appending _2) to avoid conflict

  We introduce some constants, so we have fewer numbers to remember.
    Data::Table::NUMBER
    Data::Table::STRING
    Data::Table::ASC
    Data::Table::DESC

  for sort(), you can use $t->sort('col2', Data::Table::NUMBER, Data::Table::DESC); it is equivalent to $t->sort('col2', 0, 1);

    Data::Table::INNER_JOIN
    Data::Table::LEFT_JOIN
    Data::Table::RIGHT_JOIN
    Data::Table::FULL_JOIN

  for join(), you may use $t->sort($t2, Data::Table::FULL_JOIN, ['col1'], ['col1']);
  it is equivalent to $t->sort($t2, 3, ['col1'], ['col1']).

  match_string, match_pattern have been generating @Data::Table::OK, which is a class-level array.
  $t->match_pattern() will now also store the results (array ref) in $t->{OK}, that should be used in the future.
  However, @Data::Table::OK is still supported for compatibility reasons.
  This is not a pain point, but conceptually nicer to be localized.

  match_pattern_hash() is added. The difference is each row is fed to the pattern as a hash %_.  In the case of
  match_pattern, each row is fed as an array ref $_.  The pattern for match_pattern_hash() becomes much cleaner.
  If a table has two columns: Col_A as the 1st column and Col_B as the 2nd column, a filter "Col_A>2 AND Col_B<2"
  is written before as
    $t->match_pattern('$_->[0] > 2 && $_->[1] <2');
  where we need to figure out $t->colIndex('Col_A') is 0 and $t->colIndex('Col_B') is 1, in order to build the pattern.
  Now you can use column name directly in the pattern:
    $t->match_pattern_hash('$_{Col_A} >2 && $_{Col_B} <2');
  This method creates $t->{OK}, as well as @Data::Table::OK, same as match_pattern().

  Data::Table::rowMerge, update to support new options
    { byName =>1, addNewCol => 1}
    If byName is 1, rows in the second table are appended by matching their column names, so that the second table
      can have columns in a different order.
    If addNewCol is 1, columns not exist in the first table will be automatically added.
      addNewCol is best used with byName. If used alone, addNewCol will just patch the two tables so that they have
      the same number of columns.
  Data::Table::subTable, update internal to remove side effect on column header array
  Data::join add support for an option {renameCol => 1}.
    If specified, duplicate column names in the second table is automatically renamed (by appending _2) to avoid conflict

1.61 Mon Feb 27 21:07:55 PST 2012
  Data::Table::fromSQL now can take DBI::st instead of a SQL string. This is introduced, so that
  variable binding (such as CLOB/BLOB) can be done outside the method.

1.60 Sat Feb 25 19:26:46 PST 2012
  Data::Table::addRow now also can take a hash reference. Hash keys are column names,
  undef will be the value, if a column name is not found in the hash.
  Suggested by Federico

1.59 Sun Feb  5 00:20:00 PST 2012
  I have never checked those CPAN ticket, happened to discover them and address them in this version.
  Update document, explain Data::Table::fromCSV(\*STDIN, 1) can be used to read table from STDIN.
  Add tbody and thead to Data::Table::html, if it's portrait.
  Suggested by Ken Rosenberry.
  Modify Data::Table::html and Data::Table::html2, so that it can accept coloring via CSS
  The color now can be either specified as an array as before, or as three CSS class names
  Suggested by Xavier Robin

1.58 Thu Feb  2 20:33:03 PST 2012
  Patch join(), prior version of join considers two NULL keys to be equal
  update document, clarify that rowMerge assumes table columns in the same order
  Thanks to Ulrik Stervbo.

1.57 Thu Apr 23 15:22:36 PDT 2009
  Patch pivot(), it throws warning before, when colToFill is undef.

1.56 Fri Aug 22 15:53:29 PDT 2008
  When the first line in a TSV is not a header, but contains strings such as \t.
  The program will not transform \t to a tab.
  Modify fromTSV, so that \t, \N (etc) transformation is optional.
  Add transform_element flag to fromTSV method to turn on/off the transformation.
  Thanks to Bin Zhou.

1.55 Mon May  5 10:29:44 PDT 2008
  Patch parseCSV. fromFile guesses the wrong delimiter if some ending columns are empty.

1.54 Sun Feb 10 21:35:02 PST 2008
  Modify fromFileGetTopLines method, remove dependency on bytes
  bytes::substr causes infinite loop in some older version of perl
  Thanks to "eserte" for help in debugging.

1.53 Thu Jan  3 21:13:40 PST 2008
  add "use bytes" to Table.pm
  Just patched test.pl, because some OS cannot open in-memory file.

1.52 Fri Dec 14 11:48:42 PST 2007
1.51 Wed Dec 12 15:36:22 PST 2007
  1. Add a class methods Data::Table::fromFile(file_name), which can
  guess the file format and call fromCSV/fromTSV internally.
  
  fromFile relies on the following new methods
    fromFileGuessOS(file_name)
    fromFileGetTopLines($file_name, $OS, $lineNumber)
    fromFileIsHeader($string)
    fromFileGuessDelimiter($arrayRefToLines)
  to figure out if the input file is from UNIX/PC/MAC, whether its first
  row contains column headers, and whether it uses ",", "\t" or ":" as
  field delimiters.
  It then calls either fromCSV or fromTSV to return the table object.

  $t = Data::Table::fromFile("myFileName_CSVorTSV_HeaderOrNoHeader_UNIXorPCorMAC");
    
  Please refers to the updated document for details.

  2. When fromFile/fromCSV/fromTSV reads from an empty file, it returns
  an undef object, rather than quit.

  3. Provide more informative error message, when invalid column header is found.

  4. fixed a bug in 1.51 where fromFileGuessOS failed in Windows
  Thanks to patches provided by "whitebell".

1.50 Thu Sep 28 07:21:38 PDT 2006
  Small modifications to sort subroutine example in the document, no bug.

  join method, if $cols2 is undefined, defaults @$cols2 to @$cols1
  Update fromCSV, fromTSV, csv methods to be able to deal with certain delimiters correctly.
    (When the delimiter is a special symbol for regexp, it should be escaped, e.g., set delimiter to '\|' for pipe symbol).
  Thanks to suggestions from Michael Slaven.

  update fromCSV, fromTSV to take additional arguments: skip_lines and skip_pattern
  skip_lines lets user skip several lines in the beginning of the input file
  skip_pattern lets user skip all lines that match a regular expression
  Please read documents under fromCSV and fromTSV for details.
  Thanks to suggestions from Wenbin Ye.

1.49 Wed Aug 30 09:29:51 PDT 2006
  Add %Data::Table::DEFAULTS to store the default settings for OS, CSV_DELIMITER and CSV_QUALIFIER
  Thanks to suggestions from Roman Filippov

  Patch sort method to deal with undef table element. undef value is considered to be
  larger than any other value, two undef values are considered equal during sorting.

1.48 Thu Jun  8 13:25:54 PDT 2006
  Update fromCSV, parseCSV to enable user-specified delimiter and qualifier,
  see document and examples under fromCSV.
  csvEscape is modified accordingly.
  Thanks to help from Roman Filippov

1.47 Sun May 21 15:03:14 PDT 2006
  Upload the wrong code in 1.46, re-upload

1.46 Sat May 13 05:44:09 PDT 2006
  fromCSV, fromTSV, csv, tsv can all take either a file hander or a file name
  Notice: to leave rooms for future development, file handler is not closed by Data::Table.
          It's caller's responsibility to close it afterwards, if no longer used.
  table::sort code is replaced, the old sort method is renamed to sort_v0 and is deprecated.
  The new sort method allow user-defined sorting operators, please read manual on table::sort
  The new sort method also runs faster in some benchmark tests.
  A big thank to Wenbin Ye for suggestions, as well as contributing
    both the new sort code and test examples

1.45 Mon May  1 09:08:20 PDT 2006
  Fix a bug in fromTSV
  last column name is truncated by one character (introduced in 1.44)
  Thanks to Albert V. Smith

1.44 Sat Apr 15 04:27:28 PDT 2006
  Fix a bug in join (type=2 and 3)
  When right or full join, key fields are undef for right-only entries.

  modify fromCSV, fromTSV, tsv, csv subroutines to support read/write PC, Mac and UNIX files.
  csv and tsv can take a file name and directly writes to it.

1.43 Tue Nov  9 10:23:44 PST 2004
  Patch html so that valid XHTML code is generated
  Several mispelled words were corrected
  Thanks all to Wolfgang Dautermann

1.42 Fri Oct  8 11:56:41 PDT 2004
  Minor changes to group and pivot, not a bug

1.41 Thu Oct  7 14:04:17 CDT 2004
  Add two useful methods: group and pivot
  group can make the records unique based on given key columns
  pivot is handy to transfer database table into a more user readable format
  group+pivot make accounting operations easy, please read the document for details.

  Thanks to Sven Neuhaus

1.20  Wed Feb 28 12:38:53 PST 2001
  A bug in match_string is fixed.
  This will affect results if you change your "string" value in the program;
  Also add a caseIgnore control argument to match_string method.
  Thanks to Bryan Coon.

1.19  Sat Feb 24 23:23:37 PST 2001
  A bug in fromSQL is fixed (caused by typo)
    This happens when user use the third argument (a reference to an array).
    The old package will show an error message in some cases.

  Add $header option for csv and tsv, output header or not

  Add the following instant methods
    fromSQLi
    fromCSVi
    fromTSVi
  so that these methods can be inherited.
  Thanks to Michael Schlueter

  Update new method, so that it can be used as an instant method as well.

  Add method
    rowHashRef
  which returns a copy of a table row in hash reference.

  Officially support TSV format via the following three methods
    Data::Table::fromTSV
    fromTSVi
    tsv
  Read "TSV FORMAT" section for details.

1.18
  Fix the problem in Data::Table::fromCSV caused by null trailing fields.
  E.g., a line "a,b,," in a csv file was split into two fields before.
  Thanks to Karsten

  Fix the warning message in Data::Table::match_string, when table contains
  an undef element.

  Add Data::Table::fromTSV and Data::Table:tsv
  TSV - tab-deliminated file format. TSV preserves NULL element and line-break
  chars in a table.
    \0, \\, \r, \b, \n, \t are slash-escaped.
    undef is escaped into \N.
  This is based on MySQL specification.

1.16  Fri Sep 29 22:18:06 PDT 2000
  Package name changed from Table to Data::Table, due to
  name collision with PerlQt
  first official release version

1.15  Tue Sep 26 18:32:52 PDT 2000
  submitted to CPAN
