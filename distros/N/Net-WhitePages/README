NAME
    Net::WhitePages - A Perl interface to the WhitePages.com API v1.0

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::WhitePages;

        my $wp = Net::WhitePages->new(TOKEN => "12345");
        my $res = $wp->find_person(lastname => "Wall", firstname => "Larry");

DESCRIPTION
    "Net::WhitePages" provides a simple perl wrapper for the whitepages.com
    API (see http://developer.whitepages.com/ for details). The interface
    matches the API exactly; see http://developer.whitepages.com/docs for a
    description of it.

    You'll need to have a whitepages.com API token to function; see
    http://developer.whitepages.com/ for a sign-up link and terms of
    service.

    WhitePages.com places strict usage limitations, which this module does
    not attempt to enforce.

    Note that this currently only works for version 1.0 of the
    WhitePages.com API.

METHODS
    find_person
        Search by a person's name and location to find the person's complete
        address and phone number. See

        details.

    reverse_phone

        See http://developer.whitepages.com/docs/Methods/reverse_address for

    Each method returns a serialized version of the results data; see
