    - Bugfix: assign the correct path to the filehandle when reading the
      minified file. This also allows windows tests to pass.

      CSS::Minifier::XS were not installed
    - add autodie to protect against ignored errors in file operations
    - add min_cache_dir to reduce pollution with files that are hard to

    - Bugfix: bin/mccs did not parse the root directory from the command

    - MCCS now knows to recognize stale minfied/compressed versions of
