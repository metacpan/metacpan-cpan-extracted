NAME

    Archive::Libarchive::Extract - An archive extracting mechanism (using
    libarchive)

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Archive::Libarchive::Extract;
     
     my $extract = Archive::Libarchive::Extract->new( filename => 'archive.tar' );
     $extract->extract;

DESCRIPTION

    This class provides a simple interface for extracting archives using
    libarchive. Although it provides similar functionality to
    Archive::Extract and Archive::Extract::Libarchive it intentionally does
    not provide a compatible interface. In particular it tends to throw
    exceptions instead tracking errors as a property. It also supports some
    unique features of the various classes that use the "Extract" style
    interface:

    Many Many formats

      Tar, Zip, RAR, ISO 9660 images, gzip, bzip2, etc.

    Zips with encrypted entries

      You can specify the passphrase or a passphrase callback with the
      constructor

    Multi-file RAR archives

      If filename is an array reference it will be assumed to be a list of
      filenames representing a single multi-file archive.

CONSTRUCTOR

 new

     my $extract = Archive::Libarchive::Extract->new(%options);

    This creates a new instance of the Extract object.

    filename

       my $extract = Archive::Libarchive::Extract->new( filename => $filename );

      This option is required, and is the filename of the archive.

    passphrase

       my $extract = Archive::Libarchive::Extract->new( passphrase => $passphrase );
       my $extract = Archive::Libarchive::Extract->new( passphrase => sub {
         ...
         return $passphrase;
       });

      This option is the passphrase for encrypted zip entries, or a
      callback which will return the passphrase.

    entry

       my $extract = Archive::Libarchive::Extract->new( entry => sub ($e) {
         ...
         return $bool;
       });

      This callback will be called for each entry in the archive, and will
      pass in the entry metadata via $e which is a
      Archive::Libarchive::Entry instance. If the callback returns a true
      value, then the entry will be extracted, otherwise it will be
      skipped.

PROPERTIES

 filename

    This is the archive filename for the Extract object.

 to

    The full path location the entries were extracted to. If "extract"
    hasn't been called yet, then this will be undef

 entry_list

     my @list = $extract->entry_list;

    The list of entry pathnames that were extracted.

METHODS

 extract

     $extract->extract(%options);

    This method extracts the entries from the archive. By default it places
    them relative to the current working directory. If you provide the to
    option it will place them there instead. This method will throw an
    exception on error.

    to

      The directory path to place the extracted entries. Will be created if
      possible/necessary.

SEE ALSO

    Archive::Extract

      The original!

    Archive::Extract::Libarchive

      Another implementation that also relies on libarchive, but doesn't
      support the file type in iterate mode, encrypted zip entries, or
      multi-file RAR archives.

    Archive::Libarchive::Peek

      An interface for peeking into archives without extracting them to the
      local filesystem.

    Archive::Libarchive

      A lower-level interface to libarchive which can be used to
      read/extract and create archives of various formats.
