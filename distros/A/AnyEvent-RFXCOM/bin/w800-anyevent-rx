=head1 NAME

w800-anyevent-rx - example script to read from an RFXCOM receiver

=head1 VERSION

version 1.142240

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # read from USB tty device
  w800-anyevent-rx /dev/ttyUSB0

  # read from USB device with nicer name see Device::W800(3)
  w800-anyevent-rx /dev/w800-rx

  # read from network/wireless device
  w800-anyevent-rx 10.0.0.1:10001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an example of the usage of the L<AnyEvent::W800> API.
It simply initializes the receiver and writes a summary of the
received RF messages to stdout.  The keys and values given on the
command line become the parameter hash for the L<AnyEvent::W800>
constructor and are documented in that module.
