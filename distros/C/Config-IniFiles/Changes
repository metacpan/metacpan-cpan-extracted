2.87        2015-06-16
    * Replace List::MoreUtils with List::Util-1.33-or-above.
        - We only used any() and none() which exist in List::Util too now.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=104764

2.78        2012-10-21

    * Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=80259:
        - Warnings on undefined value in length in perl-5.10.x.

    * Bump the List::MoreUtils dependency to '0.33'.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77930
        - Thanks to TJENNESS for the report.

2.76        2012-06-15

    * Correct the documentation regarding the syntax of calling ->WriteConfig(),

        - Thanks to the Mageia Linux QA team at:
            - https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6024#c17

2.75        2012-05-25

    * Add "=encoding utf8" to the POD of lib/Config/IniFiles.pm
        - The POD contained wide characters and it is now an error in
        with recent Test::Pod and Pod::Simple.
        - See for example: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/89000ebe-a5bc-11e1-a439-fa78ab6c2661

2.74        2012-05-24

        - Thanks to Ben Johnson for reporting the bug and for a preliminary
        test script.
        - Add t/32mswin-outputs-contain-crs.t

2.73        2012-05-14

    * Regression bug fix: temporary file creation error should generate a warning
    and return undef() instead of throwing an exception.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77039
        - Thanks to Adam D. Barrat for noticing that, and Gregor Herrmann
        from Debian for reporting this issue.

2.72        2012-05-5

    * More refactoring.

    * Now requiring Fcntl (which is a core module) for SEEK_SET() and SEEK_CUR().

    * Update the contact information on the POD.

    * Maintainer’s special birthday (5-May) release.

2.71        2012-05-2

    * SECURITY BUG FIX: Config::IniFiles used to write to a temporary filename
    with a predictable name ("${filename}-new") which opens the door for potential
    exploits.

    * Now requiring List::MoreUtils (for any() and other functions), File::Temp
    and File::Basename .

    * Add "use warnings;" to lib/Config/IniFiles.pm .

    * More refactoring.

2.70        2012-04-6

    * Fix the test dependency (in the new t/31comments_with_spaces.t test)
    on IO::stringy (now writing it to a file).
        - This caused some CPAN Testers failures such as:
            - http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/c16b9978-7f40-11e1-9d6f-f6dbfa7543f5

    * Modernized some of the open() calls in the test files.
        - three args open, lexcial file handles, etc.

2.69        2012-04-5

    * Fix https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3388382&group_id=6926&atid=106926
        - "Trailing comments with whitespace are not recognised"
        - Thanks to briconaut for the report and to rbowen for the patch and test.

    * Add the method ->OutputConfigToFileHandle which is a more explicit and
    safer version of ->OutputConfig.
        - ->OutputConfig now uses it.
        - all existing tests pass, and a new test was added to
        t/15store-and-retrieve-here-doc-terminator.t .

    * Started refactoring the code.
        - Expand tabs to spaces.
        - many other small changes.

2.68        2011-06-21

    * Typo correction: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69003

2.67        2011-06-21

    * Made sure that parameters with empty values will be written to the file.
        - Fixes https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68554 .

2.66        2011-01-29

    * Add support for the handle_trailing_comment option to support trailing
    comments at the end of a param=value line.
        - Fixes https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=43843 .
        - Original patch by Peter Xu.
        - Some comments and corrections of the patch by Shlomi Fish (the current
        Config-IniFiles maintainer.)

2.65        2010-11-25

    * Replaced calls to File::Temp's tempfile() with those to its tempdir()
    followed by File::Spec->catfile() - hopefully fixes the CPAN smoking failures
    on Win32.

2.64        2010-11-20

    * Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63177
        - tag-release.pl was installed into lib/Config by EU-MM. Converted the
        Makefile.PL to a wrapper around Build.PL by using Module-Build's
        create_makefile_pl='small' instead of create_makefile_pl='traditional' .

2.63        2010-11-19

    * Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63079 by
    refactoring/bug-fixing the main module into the _OutputParam method, which
    handles the output of multi-line and single-line parameters with all the edge
    cases.
        - The reported problem was that EOT was encountered again in certain cases
        in the output string, and now we make sure the program always avoid it. The
        reappearance of the bug was caused due to duplicate code, which was now
        eliminated.

2.62        2010-11-19

    * Applied a modified version of Steven Haryanto's commit
    ac6ace8bf09fabba4e6ea3b2826ff13cd30507bc :
        - When writing config with fallback section, also omit the fallback
        section header, like the original file. Also, change
        t/19param-found-outside-section.t a bit to not require IO::Scalar and use
        File::Temp instead (we are testing WriteConfig anyway).
        - Shlomi Fish fixed unless'es to if's and converted a do { ... } if call to
        a block conditional, as well as made the open statements on t/19param
        more secure.

    * Add -nomultiline option.
        -Applied a modified version of Steven Haryanto's commit
        2181f438d40b54c290a2dda5627a244c6e467a7b

2.61        2010-11-14

    * Correct the opening comment on t/26scalar-filehandle.t to point to the right
    bug URL and to include the title of the bug
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54997 - this is the right
        URL.

    * Correct the check in t/26scalar-filehandle.t - it should check that Perl
    is above 5.8.x - not that IO::Scalar is available, because we use
    open my $fh, "<", \$buffer;

2.60        2010-11-13

    * Made t/19param-found-outside-section.t pass in case IO::Scalar is not
    installed.
        - We got many failing test reports due to that, like:
        - http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/eb3df0f4-eeb7-11df-b934-9430e12b63f3

2.59        2010-11-12

    * Applied a patch from "sharyanto" about enabling the -fallback parameter
    to new for items outside any section.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=62944

    * Add the tag-release.pl file to tag a release.

2.58        2010-05-17

    * Incorporated a fix for some broken POD.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51617
        - Thanks to Frank Wiegand for reporting it.

    * Got rid of \r/carriage-returns's in lib/Config/IniFiles.pm .
        - It interfered with applying a patch.

    * Applied a patch to get rid of indirect object notation in the documentation
    and code ("new Config::IniFiles") and replace it with Config::IniFiles->new().
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57536
        - Thanks to Tom Molesworth for the patch.

2.57        2010-03-1

    * Fixed failure to read the ini file contents from a filehandle made out of a
      scalar
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45997
        - Applied a patch by Nicolas Mendoza - thanks!

2.56        2009-12-31

    * Hopefully fixed the skip() in t/07misc.t
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=53238
        - It was skip($num, $label) instead of skip($label, $num) and it
        lacked a "SKIP:" label.

2.55        2009-12-22

    * Refactoring the tests:
        - Converted t/05hash.t to Test::More and modernised it.
        - Converted t/06oo.t to Test::More and modernised it.
        - Testing: extracted t/lib/Config/IniFiles/TestPaths.pm.
        - Converted t/10delta.t to Test::More and modernised it.
        - Add the t_unlink method.

2.54        2009-11-18

    * Adapted t/25line-endings.t to perl-5.6.x .
        - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/11/msg6026936.html
        - Failure there.
        - did that by replacing open ">:raw" with "binmode()".

2.53        2009-11-13

    * Converted t/01basic.t to Test::More and modernised it.
    * Converted t/02weird.t to Test::More and modernised it.
    * Converted t/04import.t to Test::More and modernised it.
    * Applied a patch from Steffen Heinrich (SHE) for:
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51445
        - included t/25line-endings.t
            - modified a little.

2.52        2009-06-28

    * Added more keys to Build.PL (author, etc.)
    * Added resources and keywords to META.yml.
    * Converted t/00load.t to Test-More.
    * No longer chdir()-ing into "t" in t/00load.t
    * Got rid of the "new Config::IniFiles" syntax in the tests.
    - replaced with Config::IniFiles->new().
    - see "Perl Best Practices", "Programming Perl", 3rd Edition

2.51        2009-06-8

    * Fixed "#46721: $config->exists() does not pay attention to -nocase => 1"
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46721

2.50        2009-05-31

    * Fixed the POD for SetParameterEOT:
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28375
    * Added t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t and fixed the problems they pointed:
    - Removed some trailing pod.
        - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46549
    - Documented the ->OutputConfig() method.

2.49        2009-05-2

    * Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=45209 :
    - Makefile.PL lacked the empty "PL_FILES" directive.

    * Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45588 :
    - Failure to read ini file contents from a scalar (via "IO::Scalar").
    - added t/23scalar-ref.t

2.48        2009-04-7

    * Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30402 :
    - Trailing comments at the end of the file are not written.
    - added a test (t/22trailing-comment-lines.t ) and a test file.

    * Reverted the fix to bug #34067 ( "Multiline values returned as array
    references in tied hash interface"), as it could potentially break a lot
    of old code, and was not such a good idea, and was less preferable from
    interface-sanity reasons.

    * Documented the old API in regards to bug #34067 - see above.

2.47        2009-01-21

    * Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34067 :
    - Multiline values returned as array references in tied hash interface
    - This was as opposed to the documentation.
    - added t/21multiline-values-in-tied.t and fixed some older tests.

    * Moved the eval'ed debugging code (_assert_invariants) to its own module,
    without the eval so the perl-5.6.2 will be happy. Now explicitly use'ing it
    from t/lib where appropriate. See for example:
    - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/01/msg3101788.html

2.46        2009-01-17

    * Added regression tests for bug #1720915
    - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1720915&group_id=6926&atid=106926
    - the bug seems to be fixed in trunk.

    * Added a regression test for RT #36584
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36584
    - the bug seems to be fixed in trunk.

    * Added a regression test for RT #36309
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36309
    - Testing for allowedcommentchars.
    - the bug seems to be fixed in trunk.

    * Converted t/03comments.t to Test::More and did other cleanups in preparation
    of solving a few bugs.

    * Now GetSectionComment does the documented behaviour in scalar context and
    returns the string joined by newlines:
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8612

    * Now GetParameterComment returns the right thing in scalar context (joined
    by newlines). It was documented and tested.
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8612

2.45        2008-12-27

    * Fixed bug #1230339:
    - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1230339&group_id=6926&atid=106926
    - Can't store and retrive "\nEOT\n"
    - Fixed by checking for the existence of the here-doc terminator in the
    string, and if so appending more characters.

    * Fixed bug #1565180
    - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1565180&group_id=6926&atid=106926
    - -nocase breaks -default.
    - If a default-values section is specified, then -nocase did not look it up
    if it's not lowercase.

    * Fixed bug #1831654
    - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1831654&group_id=6926&atid=106926
    - multiline-values are tainted.
    - Added a test as t/17untainted-multiline-values.t

2.44        2008-12-25

    * Eliminated an assignment of $VERSION into itself to "get rid of warnings".
    Only caused warnings at Build.PL, and is unnecessary now that we
    "use vars".

2.43        2008-12-4

    * Placed IniFiles.pm under lib/Config/IniFiles.pm.

    * Added a Build.PL file for the distribution.

    * Moved the ChangeLog to its own file - Changes.

    * Made the README contain the useful information and nothing else - previously
    it was a copy of the module's entire POD.

    * Added a regression test for:

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=778593&group_id=6926&atid=106926

    When copying tied-hashes representing sections with multiline values as
    keys, one used to get a reference instead of a copy. This was fixed in SVN
    but not in CPAN.

    * Added a test for opening an empty file, inspired by:

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=927111&group_id=6926&atid=106926

    * Added a fix for this bug:

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=767913&group_id=6926&atid=106926

    With a test that I wrote myself: in list context, ->val() returned the list
    containing (undef()) if there was no such key. Now returning the empty
    list which evaluates to false.

    * Added a test for bug

        "[ 2030786 ] Brackets within values are treated as section headers"

    It seems to be fixed on SVN.
