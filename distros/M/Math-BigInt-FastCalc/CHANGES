  * Modified test scripts so the difference between the test files in the
    Math-BigInt distribution and the backend distributions are as few and as
    small as possible. This makes for easier release management.

2011-09-04 0.30 pjacklam

 * Math::BigInt::FastCalc now requires Math::BigInt v1.997 (Peter John Acklam).

 * Include "^MYMETA\.(yml|json)\z" in MANIFEST.SKIP. Whereas META.* are
   generated by the distribution author at packaging time, MYMETA.* are
   generated by the end user at configure time after any dynamic
   dependencies are known. (Peter John Acklam)

 * Updated common test files from the Math::BigInt distribution. (Peter
   John Acklam)

2011-07-09 0.29 rafl (7560 tests)

 * Synchronise with blead perl.
   + Reduce object code size significantly through PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT.

2011-02-26 0.28 pjacklam (7560 tests)

 * Sync codebases (CPAN vs. blead): include t/mbi_rand.t from blead,
   fix typos in FastCalc.xs and t/bigintfc.t (Peter John Acklam).

 * Remove redundant Math::BigInt::FastCalc version info from diagnostic
   output of 01load.t (Peter John Acklam).

2011-02-26 0.27 pjacklam (7560 tests)

 * Add Math::BigInt::Calc version information to diagnostics output of
   01load.t. This is useful for debugging, since Math::BigInt::FastCalc
   relies heavily on Math::BigInt::Calc (Peter John Acklam).

 * Change bigintpm.inc to reflect recent changes in the Math::BigInt
   distribution (Peter John Acklam).

2011-02-08 0.26 pjacklam (7560 tests)

 * Add Perl v5.6 compatibility code to FastCalc.xs (RT #63859)
   (Peter John Acklam).

 * Add 00sig.t for testing SIGNATURE, and 01load.t for basic module loading
   and giving diagnostics useful for bug tracking (Peter John Acklam).

 * Rename pod.t to 02pod.t and pod_cov.t to 03podcov.t and use more generic
   code (Peter John Acklam).

2011-02-06 0.251 pjacklam (7558 tests)

 * Add requirement Math::BigInt version 1.991 (Peter John Acklam).

2011-02-05 0.25 pjacklam (7558 tests)

 * Remove _new() from XS code and use _new() in Math::BigInt::Calc
   instead. The XS _new() doesn't handle integers that are too large to
   be represented exactly as floating point numbers, but small enough
   to be represented as 64 bit integers. The XS _new() also returns
   nan, not inf, when it overflows. This closes RT #63335 and RT #49569
   (Peter John Acklam).

 * Copied test files from latest Math::BigInt (v1.991): bigfltpm.inc,
   bigfltpm.t, bigintpm.inc, bigintpm.t, mbi_rand.t, mbimbf.inc,
   mbimbf.t (Peter John Acklam).

2010-11-07 0.24 rafl (6938 tests)

 * Reduce repetition (and object size) in FastCalc.xs by using ALIASes
   (Nicholas Clark).

 * inline the macros CONSTANT_OBJ and RETURN_MORTAL_BOOL. (Nicholas Clark).

 * Avoid creating two entries instead of one on the mortals stack in _new() and
   _zero() (Nicholas Clark).

 * Convert from DynaLoader to XSLoader (Nicholas Clark).

 * Adapt to the changed order of the return value Math::BigInt::Calc::_base_len
   in Math::BigInt 1.97 (Nicholas Clark).

 * Initialise BASE and BASE_LEN as part of bootstrap, avoiding special one-shot
   setter routines (Nicholas Clark).

 * Remove the $BASE or $BASE_LEN globals. They were never documented or
   exported, and are now unnecessary (Nicholas Clark).

2010-09-14 0.22 rafl (6938 tests)

 * Modernize the test suite to use Test::More instead of Test.

2010-09-03 0.21 rafl (6892 tests)

   + added _is_two(), _is_ten(), and _ten()

 * cleaned XS code, got rid of "unused var" warnings (thanx perl-xs people!)

2002-08-25 0.06 Tels (5355 tests)

 * working _modinv() and fix for _rsft() taken over from Calc v0.32

 * added tests for _rsft() and _modinv()

 * require Math::BigInt v1.62

 * _num(), _dec() and _inc() are now in XS

2002-08-13 0.05 Tels (5224 tests)

 * the note that "_len() and _acmp() are in XS" was missing

 * cleaned distribution of unwanted files

2002-08-13 0.04 Tels first release
 - added is_zero(), is_one(), _zero(), _one(), _two() and _acmp()
 - more tests in bigintfc.t

 Some general observations:

 * is_*() methods are quite a bit faster than in Calc, but due to the
   overhead in Math::BigInt real programs will get only a bit faster
   (around 2-5%).

 * Comparisation is *much* faster, and even via Math::BigInt improves the
   performance by about factor 9 for large numbers. For smaller numbers (less
   than 8000 digits) it is still about factor 2.5 to 8. This is only valid if
   the numbers have both the same length. If the length is different, then
   FastCalc is still about a factor of 1.2 to 1.7 faster than Calc.
