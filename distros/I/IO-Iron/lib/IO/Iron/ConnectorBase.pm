=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creator function.

=cut

sub new {
	my ($class) = @_;
	$log->tracef('Entering new(%s)', $class);
	my $self = {};
	my @self_keys = ( ### no critic (CodeLayout::ProhibitQuotedWordLists)
		# No keys.
	);

	bless $self, $class;
	lock_keys(%{$self}, @self_keys);

	$log->tracef('Exiting new: %s', $self);
	return $self;
}

	# Connector needs:
	# all API info
	# params for API.href     => if it's a mock!
	# message body
	# headers: content type, authorization
	# connection params: timeout?, retry?
	# Connector arranges by inself:
	# HTTP REST connection: REST::Client / LWP


=head2 perform_iron_action

=over 8

=item Params: action name, params hash.

=item Return: 1/0 (1 if success, 0 in all failures),
HTTP return code, hash if success/failed request.
If you need to create your own Connector class, start with copying
this routine.
