Revision history for RPi-I2C

2.3605  2018-02-09
        - fix typo in POD (closes #3)
        - made more clear the warning if having issues communicating with an
          Arduino (closes #5)

2.3604  2017-06-28
        - removed WiringPi::API from being a prereq
        - POD fixes
        - added UNIT TESTS section in POD to explain why there's no unit tests
          for this distribution
        - remove useless int param in XS readByte(), throwing a compiler warning

2.3603  2017-06-23
        - completely changed the way we work. We do not use wiringPi for this
          anymore due to lack of options
        - major POD overhaul
        - added several examples using I2C to an Arduino (Trinket Pro or Uno).
          This provides examples for nearly every function. Internally in the
          Arduino sketch, on the write functions, we save the data to EEPROM,
          where the data can be fetched back out at a certain register to make
          comparisons on (this functionality will be incorporated into the
          RPi::WiringPi unit test suite)

2.3601  2017-06-22
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
