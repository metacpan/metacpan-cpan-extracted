0.014000	2026-01-13

 [ Packaging ]
 - Bump version of Class::XSConstructor dependency.

 [ Other ]
 - Only bother creating a DESTROY method in classes which have (or inherit)
   a DEMOLISH method. Otherwise, there's no point as it just makes the
   object lifecycle slower even when implemented in XS.

0.013001	2026-01-12

 [ Packaging ]
 - Bump version of Class::XSConstructor dependency.

0.013000	2026-01-12

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Add a test for foreign inheritance.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Attributes now support an undef_tolerant option.
 - Added: Marlin::X::UndefTolerant plugin to automatically apply
   undef_tolerant option to all attributes in a class or role (except those
   that don't make sense).
 - If you try to inherit from a class that uses Marlin::XAttribute::Alias
   in Moose, it will try to load MooseX::Aliases and use that, issuing a
   warning if the module is missing.
 - If you try to inherit from a class that uses Marlin::XAttribute::Lvalue
   in Moose, it will try to load MooseX::LvalueAttribute and use that,
   issuing a warning if the module is missing.
 - Marlin::X::Clone understands about required attributes and
   undef_tolerant attributes.
 - Moved a lot of the code for Moo/Moose compatibility into MooX::Marlin
   and MooseX::Marlin, so it clutters up the main Marlin modules less.

0.012001	2026-01-11

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Better detection if parent classes use Class::XSConstructor directly.

0.012000	2026-01-11

 [ Documentation ]
 - Marlin now has improved inheritance from foreign classes thanks to
   latest Class::XSConstructor.
 - Marlin now supports BUILDARGS thanks to latest Class::XSConstructor.
 - Update copyright years.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require Class::XSConstructor 0.018001.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Improvements to Class::XSConstructor mean we should never need
   to generate pure Perl constructors, so stripped out all the code to do
   that and replaced with a few shims to send the right options to
   Class::XSConstructor.

0.011002	2026-01-09

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Certain setup steps were not running correctly for roles.
 - The before/after/around keywords exported to roles were ones only
   suitable for classes; they have been replaced with ones which work for
   roles.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Update benchmark script; compare some more simple classes too.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require Sub::Accessor::Small 1.000003.

0.011001	2026-01-08

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Marlin::XAttribute::Alias pod syntax fix.

 [ Documentation ]
 - Marlin::X::Clone documentation improvements.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require Class::XSAccessor 0.016002.

 [ Other ]
 - Check that code is actually compiling before using B::Hooks::AtRuntime,
   otherwise just run stuff immediately.
 - Marlin::X::Clone is now aware of Marlin::XAttribute::Alias.
 - Marlin::X::Clone now supports more on_clone options.
 - Marlin::X::Clone performance improvements.

0.011000	2026-01-07

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require Class::XSAccessor 0.016001.
 - Require Type::Tiny 2.010000.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Provide MooseX::Marlin and MooX::Marlin to allow Moose and Moo to
   inherit from Marlin classes and compose Marlin roles.
 - Marlin::Struct's magical coercion from arrayrefs is now aware of
   ':Alias'.
 - Marlin::XAttribute::Alias no longer forces PP constructors to be
   generated.
 - Move some attribute logic from Marlin to Marlin::Attribute making it
   easier for attribute extensions to override.
 - Support inheritance from Class::Tiny classes.
 - Support inheritance from Mite classes and composing Mite roles.
 - Support inheritance from Mouse classes and composing Mouse roles.
 - Updated: Changes to work with newest Class::XSAccessor.

0.010000	2025-12-29

 [ Documentation ]
 - Show how easy it is to switch from Class::Tiny to Marlin.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: Marlin::XAttribute::Alias is bundled as a demonstration of the
   extension API (and because it can be useful).
 - Added: Marlin::XAttribute::LocalWriter is bundled as a demonstration of
   the extension API (and because it can be useful).
 - Added: Marlin::XAttribute::Lvalue is bundled as a demonstration of the
   extension API (and because it can be useful).
 - Marlin now provides a rudimentary API for attribute extension modules.

0.009000	2025-12-28

 - Added: Marlin::X::Clone is bundled as a demonstration of the extension
   API (and because it can be useful).
 - Marlin now provides a rudimentary API for extension modules.
 - Stop using `mkopt` to parse parameters; do it more manually to allow
   some options to take a simple string as their value instead of requiring
   a reference.

0.008000	2025-12-23

 [ Documentation ]
 - Better documentation of Marlin::Struct.
 - Document API.
 - Omit -strict from examples as that is now the default.

 [ Other ]
 - Classes built with Marlin::Struct now provide a default stringification
   and arrayrefification.
 - Internally use Clone::clone() instead of Storage::dclone() as it can
   cope with coderefs.
 - Marlin can now inherit from Moose and Moo classes and compose Moose and
   Moo roles.
 - Provide some useful utility API methods.
 - Various small improvements to Marlin::Struct.

0.007001	2025-12-22

 [ Other ]
 - Use a newer version of Class::XSConstructor which fixes broken test
   case.

0.006000	2025-12-19

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Changes upstream in Class::XSConstructor have broken one test in the
   test suite, so this has been marked TODO for now.

   weak_ref, and init_arg.

   coercion and defaults/builders to run in the constructor.
