NAME

    Mojolicious::Plugin::JSONRPC2 - JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP

VERSION

    This document describes Mojolicious::Plugin::JSONRPC2 version v2.0.1

SYNOPSIS

        use JSON::RPC2::Server;
    
        # in Mojolicious app
        sub startup {
            my $app = shift;
            $app->plugin('JSONRPC2');
    
            my $server = JSON::RPC2::Server->new();
    
            $r->jsonrpc2('/rpc', $server);
            $r->jsonrpc2_get('/rpc', $server)->over(
                headers => { $app->jsonrpc2_headers }
            );

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Plugin::JSONRPC2 is a plugin that allow you to handle some
    routes in Mojolicious app using JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP protocol.

    Implements this spec:
    http://www.simple-is-better.org/json-rpc/transport_http.html. The
    "pipelined Requests/Responses" is not supported yet.

INTERFACE

 defaults

        $app->defaults( 'jsonrpc2.timeout' => 300 );

    Configure timeout for RPC requests in seconds (default value 5
    minutes).

 jsonrpc2

        $app->routes->jsonrpc2( $path, $server );

    Add handler for JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP protocol on $path (with
    format=>0) using POST method.

    RPC functions registered with $server will be called only with their
    own parameters (provided with RPC request) - if they will need access
    to Mojolicious app you'll have to provide it manually (using global
    vars or closures).

 jsonrpc2_get

        $app->routes->jsonrpc2_get( $path, $server_safe_idempotent );

    WARNING! In most cases you don't need it. In other cases usually you'll
    have to use different $server objects for POST and GET because using
    GET you can provide only safe and idempotent RPC functions (because of
    GET semantic, caching/proxies, etc.).

    Add handler for JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP protocol on $path (with
    format=>0) using GET method.

    RPC functions registered with $server_safe_idempotent will be called
    only with their own parameters (provided with RPC request) - if they
    will need access to Mojolicious app you'll have to provide it manually
    (using global vars or closures).

 jsonrpc2_headers

        $app->routes->over(headers => { $app->jsonrpc2_headers });

    You can use this condition to distinguish between JSON-RPC 2.0 and
    other request types on same $path - for example if you want to serve
    web page and RPC on same url you can do this:

        my $r = $app->routes;
        $r->jsonrpc2_get('/', $server)->over(headers=>{$app->jsonrpc2_headers});
        $r->get('/')->to('controller#action');

    If you don't use this condition and plugin's handler will get request
    with wrong headers it will reply with 415 Unsupported Media Type.

OPTIONS

    Mojolicious::Plugin::JSONRPC2 has no options.

    Mojolicious::Plugin and implements the following new ones.
