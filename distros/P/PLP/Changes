3.23 - October 21, 2009:
- Make tests pass on various systems
- Fix header output using say() on Perl >= 5.10.1
- EscapeHTML() for basic attribute quoting
- Fix vim syntax highlighting of normal Perl code

3.22 - June 2, 2008:
- Fix delete %header
- Fix breakage with old versions of Exporter
- Tests emulating actual PLP usage

3.21 - May 31, 2008:
- Fix everything() wrapper (broke pre-3.20 CGI scripts on 3.20)
- %header values containing newlines will be sent as multiple fields
- Encoding functions retain undef
- Add charset to Content-Type header for UTF-8 output
- All modules use warnings and contain a $VERSION
- Fix META.yml syntax
- Test pod coverage

3.20 - May 29, 2008:
- MIT license
- FastCGI support
- mod_perl2 support (but not recommended; read docs!)
- Lighttpd and Apache2 support (either CGI or FastCGI)
- Seperate modules for backend-specific code
- Documentation updates
- Fix html of default error message
- Example plpinfo.plp, modeled after phpinfo

3.19 - September 15, 2005:
- New maintainer
- Send headers when using C<printf> to start output
- Do not send headers when C<print>ing multiple empty strings
- EncodeURI()/DecodeURI() now accept read-only values
- Cleaner and slightly faster code in Entity(), DecodeURI(), and EncodeURI()
- Removed (undocumented) function HiddenFields
- Tests for a few Functions
- Documentation fixes and elaboration

3.18 - October 16, 2002:
- Fixed the class for tied headers. Content_Type is now really converted to
  Content-Type, as explained in L<PLP::Fields>
- Added some bits to L<PLP::HowTo>
- Closing :> is now optional (which is handy for code-only PLP documents that
  should not send additional whitespace)

3.17 - August 21, 2002:
- More cleanups
- %get is now built on script start, no longer on first access
- Apache->request->print is used now under mod_perl, not print (faster)
- Small documentation fixes
- Setting a header when headers are already sent now tells you where output
  started
- Speeded up source()

3.16 - May 21, 2002:
- Cleaned up a little
- Changed compile-time <(...)> includes to use paths relative to the file they
  are included by. Include() of course still uses paths relative to the current
  working directory
- Added and removed Safe.pm implementation. Safe's reval() crashes Apache on
  Linux :(
- Removed useless constant in void context in PLP::Functions
- Added some documentation

3.15 - May 21, 2002:
- Added caching of scripts. This means using more memory but it also means
  executing scripts 45-65% faster! (mod_perl only)
- Added configurability of caching: PerlSetVar PLPcache On/Off (Default: On)
- Changed PLP.pm to use File::Basename and File::Spec
- Added recursion protection for compile-time includes (fixed max depth: 128)

3.14 - May 20, 2002:
- New plp.vim
- Small documentation change

3.13 - May 20, 2002
- Added documentation:
  - PLP
  - PLP::FAQ
  - PLP::Fields
  - PLP::Functions
- Added predeclared of hashes for use-strict-users ("our"/"use vars"
  is no longer necessary for the PLP hashes)
- Added plp.vim for vim syntax highlighting to the distribution
- Added error reportig to Counter, ReadFile and WriteFile
- Changed ReadFile and WriteFile to use lexical filehandles
- Changed PLP::Functions to use Fcntl for improved portability
- Cleaned up PLP::Fields: removed the PLPdummies
- Fixed DELETE, EXISTS and FIRSTKEY in PLP::Tie::Delay (added PLPdummy there)

3.12 - May 18, 2002
- Fixed strict-violation in PLP.pm that happened only without mod_perl

3.11 - May 18, 2002
- Fixed all tie-stuff by reverting a change. Symbol.pm's delete_package doesn't
  delete a package in the way I thought it did.

3.10 - May 18, 2002
- First standardized module distribution, to allow easy distribution via CPAN
- Caution: installation procedure has changed because of that!
- Moved all code from plp.cgi to PLP.pm, and made PLP.pm use strict (it was
  strict compliant, but didn't actually use the pragma).
- Added mod_perl handler() for extremely easy installation :)
- Added some documentation (perldoc PLP) with installation instructions
- Moved a few lines from init() to start()
- Added comments in PLP.pm
- Uses Symbol.pm to delete the package (Symbol is in the Perl distr.)

3.06 - April 23, 2002
- Added PLP_END functionality to simulate END { ... } for mod_perl
- Fixed header sending in case PLP::Tie::Print->PRINT never happened
- Added an override for exit(), to avoid needless debugging output in mod_perl

3.05 - April 12, 2002
- Fixed a potential bug in PLP::source and PLP::Functions::Counter

3.04 - April 11, 2002
- $PLP::DEBUG works again (set to 1 for $@ output, 2 for plain text+headers,
  3 for both)
- $PLP::ERROR is now a subref that can be overridden (April 12: see FAQ for
  info)

3.03 - April 11, 2002
- Removed a bug that made sending alternative headers impossible. Sorry!
- By the way, remember that if you want to send headers, the "<:" have to be
  the very first characters in the file, with no white space in front of it!

3.02 - April 11, 2002
- Efficiency improvement by caching initialisation in PLP.pm

3.01 - April 10, 2002
- Bugfixes: include() used strict, fixed some typos, logging
- Improved: error reporting

3.00 - April 9, 2002
- New release, a lot has been done from scratch again, this time following 
  strict rules and mod_perl compatible. It's also a lot faster than 2.x.
