    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
    my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
    script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.


    One last thing - The SAP NW RFC SDK is a prerequisite for this perl package
    to work.  The NW RFC SDK is proprietary software owned by SAP AG.  For this
    reason I will not supply ANY component part of the RFCSDK with this perl 
    package, and further more you must obtain it through the normal channels 
    with SAP AG - ie. you must have a licensed SAP R/3 installation at your
    disposal.


****ATTENTION****

This package will NOT work unless you obtain the latest NW RFC SDK for SAP NewWeaver
from SAP - this is package is commonly referred to as "sapnwrfc", and is a complete
rewrite from the previous one called SAP::Rfc.


Installation

In brief, the following should work on most systems:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test  << provide all your host routing information.
  make install

Help on the build process is available by doing:
  perl Makefile.PL --help

and it says:

The whole trouble with the build process is one 
of determining what your OS is, and which RFC
library needs to be linked in, and where that 
library lives.

To help with this there are two command line
options that you can use to point me in the 
right direction:

(1) --source /usr/sap/rfcsdk
  This tells me where to look for your installed
  RFCSDK.  This must be the directory that contains
  the ./lib and ./include directories of the RFCSDK
  In the include directory must be saprfc.h etc.
  By default, this looks in /usr/sap/rfcsdk

(2) --addlibs ' -lm -ldl -lpthread '
  This tells me what additional libraries need to
  be passed in at link time - this can be anything
  that you would put in LDFLAGS.
  By default this is ' -lm -ldl -lpthread '

YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU ADD THE LIB PATH TO LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
EG:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/rfcsdk/lib

Example:

perl Makefile.PL --source /opt/rfcsdk --addlibs '-lsomethingwacky'

My personal build script contains:
perl Makefile.PL --source=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk

where the SAR file for the NW RFC SDK has been unpacked into 
/home/piers/code/sap.

Help on obtaining the NW RFC SDK can be found in the OSS notes 
on http://service.sap.com/support.

Ulrich updates the notes:
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1025361  - availability
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1056696  - compiling help

Please email directly if you have problems, and are willing to help 
with testing (especially for other platforms) => piers@cpan.org.

HP-UX
-------
sapnwrfc has been successfully tested under HP-UX 64bit architecture.

Make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to include the lib directory
of your NW RFC SDK and run "perl Makefile.PL  –addlibs='-lCsup'"

You must make sure that you are pointing the the 64 bit Perl - most likely
in /opt/perl_64 and that the sym link for /opt/perl points to this too.
