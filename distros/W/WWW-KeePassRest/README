WWW-KeePassRest

KeePass is a nifty Windows app (with work-alikes for Linux) that stores passwords and other sensitive
information in an encrypted database on the local hard drive. When open, it can then be used to manage
usernames and passwords, even generating new passwords with crunchy random goodness.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could just use the open KeePass instance for unattended retrieval of usernames
and passwords for your Web-enabled scripts? Well, with the doubly nifty KeePassRest plug-in, you can do
just that!

KeePassRest exposes a minimal API on localhost:12984, secured by SSL and accessed with a JSON API.
You can't do everything with it (you can't generate passwords, work with groups of entries, etc.) but
for that stuff you've got L<File::KeePass> anyway.

Here's the absolutely simplest possible way to use WWW::KeePassRest:

    use LWP;
    use WWW::KeePassRest;
    use strict;

    my $url = 'http://somesite.com/aa/bb/cc.html';
    my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new('Mozilla');
    $browser->credentials("somesite.com:80", "Realm", WWW:::KeePassRest->get_by_title('Some site credentials', 'UserName', 'Password'));
    my $response=$browser->get($url);

Seriously. Easy as that. Notice that there is I<absolutely no sensitive information> in this script.
The username and password are stored in KeePass under the title "Some site credentials". The script will
only run when KeePass is running and you've given it your password entirely separately - and that needs
to happen I<once>, after which your scripts can run to your heart's content with no further need to
enter passwords.
If KeePass is not running, the call here will croak with "KeePass not running", so you can easily trap for that case.

Note that KeePass is actually based on a nifty key/value-oriented database and could be used for any kind
of sensitive information, not just usernames and passwords.
