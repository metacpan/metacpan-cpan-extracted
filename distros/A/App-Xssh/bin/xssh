=head1 NAME

xssh - A customisable X terminal emulator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	xssh HOST
	xssh --sethostopt HOST OPTION VALUE
	xssh --setprofileopt PROFILE OPTION VALUE
	xssh --showconfig
	xssh --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program will allow you to ssh to a remote host inside a new X Terminal
window (like XTerm).  

The idea here is that each time you ssh to a particular host, a terminal
window will be launched with a consistent customised appearance.  For
example, you may wish to configure 'prodserver' so the terminal window
background is a redish colour - reminding you to tread very carefully...

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--sethostopt> HOST OPTION VALUE

Set or update a host option and save it to the config file.

A host option defines an attribute that will always apply when you refer
to that host.

It is also possoble to define a regular expression for the HOST.  The
option you define will apply to all hosts that match the regular expression.

=item B<--setprofileopt> PROFILE OPTION VALUE

Set or update a profile option and save it to the config file.

Hosts can be defined with a profile option, in which case all options
defined for that profile will be applied to that host.

=item B<--showconfig>

Display the current configuration to STDOUT.

=item B<--version>

Display the current version string and exit.

=head1 EXAMPLES

First, you may like to define some defualts that will apply to all the
remote servers you might log in to.

	xssh --sethostopt DEFAULT scrollback 1024
	xssh --sethostopt DEFAULT foreground blue
	xssh --sethostopt DEFAULT background white

Then you may like to override those defaults for some specific hosts.

	xssh --sethostopt favourite foreground green
	xssh --sethostopt favourite background black
	xssh --sethostopt favourite geometry 128x70

You may then get bored with setting all options for all hosts, so you
might want to set up some "profile" options.

	xssh --setprofileopt prod foreground black
	xssh --setprofileopt prod background IndianRed

You would then define which hosts take those profile options.

	xssh --sethostopt important profile prod

FINALLY, you can use xssh to log in to those servers

	# Log in to the server "important" - you'll get a new xterm
	# window with a redish background, black text, 1024 lines of
	# scrollback
	xssh important
	
	# Log in to the server "unknown" - you'll get a new xterm window
	# with a white background, blue text, 1024 lines of scrollback
	xssh unknown
	
	# Log in to the server "favourite" - you'll get a new xterm
	# window with a black background, green text, 1024 lines of
	# scrollback, and a larger terminal
	xssh favourite
