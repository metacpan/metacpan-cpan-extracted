 [ Documentation ]
 - Bundle a multimethod example (stolen from MooseX:MultiMethods).
 - Improvements to the SUPPORT and SEE ALSO sections of the documentation.
 - Warn about some planned changes.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Test that `use true` is imported by Moops.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Remove outdated dependency on Sub::Name from packaging metadata.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: namespace::autoclean now supports Moo enough that we can start
   using it instead of namespace::sweep.

0.033	2014-08-16

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix bugs introduced in 0.032 with role application via guards.

 [ Other ]
 - Updated: Take advantage of improvements in Type::Library/Type::Registry
   1.000000.

0.032	2014-08-13

 [ BACK COMPAT ]
 - Role composition is now delayed to the end of a class declaration.
   Matt S Trout++

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix a typo in Moops::Manual::Objects101.
   Fixes RT#93553.
   Ron Savage++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=93553>

 [ Packaging ]
 - PerlX::Assert is no longer bundled with Moops; it has been split out
   into a separate distribution.

0.031	2014-03-23

 [ Documentation ]
 - Fix typo in manual.
   Fixes RT#93553.
   Ron Savage++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=93553>
 - Use the `true` constant instead of the number 1 in the cli-app.pl
   example.

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Test Moops in threaded Perls.
   Aaron James Trevena++

 [ Other ]
 - Added: The new import parameter `-strict` enables loading strictures.pm
   within Moops scopes.
 - Avoid returning 0 from `assert` statements (PerlX::Assert).
 - Use Parse::Keyword instead of Devel::Pragma in order to establish the
   currently compiling package name. Devel::Pragma has issues under
   ithreads.

0.030	2014-01-30

 [ Documentation ]
 - Include an example using Moops to write a command-line app.
   Maurice Mengel++
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-moops/pull/1>

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require at least version 0.027 of Kavorka; this resolves a conflict
   using Moops with MooX::Options.

 [ Other ]
 - Hard-code a list of warnings categories to fatalize; this means that
   warnings categories added to future versions of Perl will not magically
   become fatal in Moops.

0.029	2014-01-04

   META.json.

 [ Other ]
 - Improve Moops' extensibility via parser traits.

   happen to have installed Moops over the top of a pre-0.012 version of
   Moops.

   declarations; treat these as traits for the code generator.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix custom imports feature.

 [ Packaging ]
 - Add Mouse and Moose as 'runtime suggests' dependencies.
 - Add Perl 5.14 as an explicit dependency.

 [ Other ]
 - Improvements handling comments when parsing.
 - Massive amounts of refactoring to simplify maintenance and make
   subclassing easier.

0.004	2013-08-14

 - Added: Implement `before`, `after` and `around` method modifiers.
 - Added: Implement `define` keyword to declare constants.
 - Removed: Drop the `classmethod` keyword; it's better to use `method` and
   give the invocant an explicit variable name.
 - Removed: Drop the `exporter` keyword; it is better to explicitly create
   a class extending Exporter::TypeTiny or Exporter.
 - The `method` keyword is only available in classes and roles; not plain
   namespaces.

0.003	2013-08-13

 [ Packaging ]
 - use Dist::Inkt.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: New keyword `namespace`.
 - Don't export Try::Tiny to the outer scope, as it's not lexical.
 - Misc internal refactoring.
 - Re-implement relative package names, in a new, saner way.

   type constraint reification.

0.002	2013-07-17

 - Added: use MooX::late 0.014.
 - Misc internal refactoring.
 - Updated: use Moo 1.003000.
