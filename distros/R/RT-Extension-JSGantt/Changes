   If one exists but not the other, first try to caculate by the time
   estimated (or TimeLeft + TimeWorked) and the config
   $JSGanttWorkingHoursPerDay; if fails, use config $JSGanttDefaultDays.

   If both are not defined, find the minimal start date of the whole
   result, use it for both start and end dates, and use config
   $JSGanttNullDatesColor to draw
