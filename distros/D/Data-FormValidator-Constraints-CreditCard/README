    Data::FormValidator::Constraints::CreditCard - Data constraints, using
    Business::CreditCard

SYNOPSIS

      use Data::FormValidator::Constraints::CreditCard qw(:all);
    
      constraint_methods => {
          cc_number     => [
            # number is syntactically valid
            FV_cc_number(),
    
            # verify type, by value
            FV_cc_type(qw(Visa MasterCard)),
    
            # verify type, by regex
            FV_cc_type(qr/visa|mastercard/i),
            ],
    
          # expiry month is within valid range
          cc_exp_mon    => FV_cc_expiry_month(),
    
          # expiry year is not in the past
          cc_exp_year   => FV_cc_expiry_year(),
    
          # full expiry date is not in the past
          cc_expiry     => FV_cc_expiry(),
      },

DESCRIPTION

    Data::FormValidator::Constraints::CreditCard provides several methods
    that can be used to generate constraint closures for use with
    Data::FormValidator for the purpose of validating credit card numbers
    and expiry dates, using Business::CreditCard.

METHODS

    FV_cc_number()

      Creates a constraint closure that returns true if the constrained
      value appears to be a valid credit card number.

      NOTE: "appears to be a valid credit card number" ONLY means that the
      number appears to be valid and has passed the checksum test; -NO-
      tests have been performed to verify that this is actually a
      real/valid credit card number.

    FV_cc_type(@set)

      Creates a constraint closure that returns true if the constrained
      value appears to be a credit card of one of the types listed in the
      given @set. The @set can be provided as either a list of scalars
      (which are compared using the eq operator), or as a list of regular
      expressions.

      For more information on the actual card types that can be checked
      for, please refer to the information for the cardtype() method in
      Business::CreditCard.

    FV_cc_expiry()

      Creates a constraint closure that returns true if the constrained
      value appears to be a valid credit card expiry date; correct integer
      values for year/month, with the date not being in the past.

      Accepted formats include "MM/YY" and "MM/YYYY".

      NOTE: use of this method requires that the full credit card expiry
      date be present in a single field; no facilities are provided for
      gathering the month/year data from two separate fields.

    FV_cc_expiry_month()

      Creates a constraint closure that returns true if the constrained
      value appears to be a valid credit card expiry month; an integer in
      the range of "1-12".

    FV_cc_expiry_year()

      Creates a constraint closure that returns true if the constrained
      value appears to be a valid credit card expiry year; an integer value
      for a year, not in the past.

      Expiry years can be provided as either "YY" or "YYYY". When using the
      two-digit "YY" format, the year is considered to be part of the
      sliding window 1970-2069.
