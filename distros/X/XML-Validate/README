QUICK START:

Install XML::Validate by unpacking the tarball and running the following
commands in the source directory:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    Then delete the source directory tree since it's no longer needed.

    run 'perldoc XML::Validate' to read the full documentation.

AVAILABLE BACKENDS:

Backends for the following validators are included with this distribution:

    LibXML (& you'll need XML::LibXML)
    Xerces (& you'll need XML::Xerces)
    MSXML  (for Win32 platforms, needs Win32::OLE)

The default order of preference if all 3 are available is: Xerces, MSXML, LibXML

DEPENDENCIES:

Other than the modules for use with the backends, the XML::Validate modules themselves
don't depend on other CPAN distributions.  However the unit tests distributed with
them use Test::Assertions and Log::Trace (as indicated in the Makefile.PL).
