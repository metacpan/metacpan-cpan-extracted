NAME
    Data::Grid - Incremental read access to grid-based data

VERSION
    Version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Grid;

        # Have the parser guess the kind of file, using defaults.

        my $grid = Data::Grid->parse('arbitrary.xls');

        # or

        my $grid = Data::Grid->parse(
            source  => 'arbitrary.csv', # or xls, or xlsx, or filehandle...
            header  => 1,               # first line is a header everywhere
            columns => [qw(a b c)],     # override the header
            options => \%options,       # driver-specific options
        );

        # Each object contains one or more tables.

        for my $table ($grid->tables) {

            # Each table has one or more rows.

            while (my $row = $table->next) {

                # The columns can be dereferenced as an array,

                my @cols = @$row; # or just $row->columns

                # or, if header is present or fields were named in the
                # constructor, as a hash.

                my %cols = %$row;

                # Now we can do stuff.
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Problem 1
        You have a mountain of data files from two decades of using MS
        Office (and other) products, and you want to collate their contents
        into someplace sane.

    Problem 2
        The files are in numerous different formats, and a consistent
        interface would really cut down on the effort of extracting them.

    Problem 3
        You've looked at Data::Table and Spreadsheet::Read, but deemed their
        table-at-a-time strategy to be inappropriate for your purposes.

    The goal of Data::Grid is to provide an extensible, uniform,
    object-oriented interface to all kinds of grid-shaped data. A key
    behaviour I'm after is to perform an incremental read over a potentially
    large data source, so as not to unnecessarily gobble up system
    resources.

DEVELOPER RELEASE
    Odds are I will probably decide to change the interface at some point
    before locking in, and I don't want to guarantee consistency yet. If I
    do, and you use this, your code will probably break.

    Suffice to say this module is ALPHA QUALITY at best.

METHODS
  parse $FILE | %PARAMS
    The principal way to instantiate a Data::Grid object is through the
    "parse" factory method. You can either pass it a filelike thing or a set
    of parameters. *Filelike thing* is either a filename, "GLOB" reference,
    "SCALAR" reference or "ARRAY" reference of scalars. If the filelike
    thing is passed alone, its type will be detected using File::MMagic. To
    tune this behaviour, use the parameters:

    source
        This is equivalent to $file.

    header
        If you know that the document you're opening has a header, set this
        flag to a true value and it will be consumed for use in "as_hash" in
        Data::Grid::Row. If there is more than one table in the document,
        set this value to an "ARRAY" reference of flags. This object will be
        treated as a ring, meaning that, for instance, if the header
        designation is "[1, 0]", the third table in the document will be
        treated as having a header, fourth will not, the fifth will, and so
        on.

    columns
        Specify a list of columns in lieu of a header, or otherwise override
        any header, which is thrown away. A single "ARRAY" reference of
        strings will be duplicated to each table in the document. An array
        of arrays will be applied to each table with the same wrapping
        behaviour as "header".

    start
        Set a row offset, i.e, a number of rows to skip *before* any header.
        Since this is an offset, it starts with zero. Same rule applies for
        multiple tables in the document.

    skip
        Set a number of rows to skip *after* the header, defaulting, of
        course, to zero. Same multi-table rule applies.

    options
        This "HASH" reference will be passed as-is to the driver.

    driver
        Specify a driver and bypass type detection. Modules under the
        Data::Grid namespace can be handed in as CSV, Excel, and
        Excel::XLSX. Prefix with a "+" for other package namespaces.

    checker
        Specify either MMagic or MimeInfo to detect the type of file. MMagic
        is the default. In lieu of the class name

  tables
    Generate and return the array of tables.

  fh
    Retrieve the document's file handle embedded in the grid object.

EXTENSION INTERFACE
    Take a look at Data::Grid::CSV or Data::Grid::Excel for clues on how to
    extend this package.

  table_class
    Returns the class to use for instantiating tables. Defaults to
    Data::Grid::Table, which is an abstract class. Override this accessor
    and its neighbours with your own values for extensions.

  row_class
    Returns the class to use for instantiating rows. Defaults to
    Data::Grid::Row.

  cell_class
    Returns the class to use for instantiating cells. Defaults to
    Data::Grid::Cell, again an abstract class.

  table_params $POSITION
    Generate a set of parameters suitable for passing in as a constructor,
    either as a hash or "HASH" reference, depending on calling context.
