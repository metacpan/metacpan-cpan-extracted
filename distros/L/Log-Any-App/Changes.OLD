Revision history for Log-Any-App. This is the original version of Log-Any-App.
After 0.42 (2012-12-28), a new alternate distribution Alt-Log-Any-App-FWR was
developed which uses File::Write::Rotate for file logging to replace
Log::Dispatch::FileRotate (see File-Write-Rotate's documentation for more
details on the motivation to develop the module to replace
Log::Dispatch::FileRotate). Development of new features then moves to this
alternate distribution. After a while, this distribution is retired and
Alt-Log-Any-App-FWR becomes the new Log-Any-App.
