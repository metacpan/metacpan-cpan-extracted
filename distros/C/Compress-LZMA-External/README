NAME
    Compress::LZMA::External - Compress and decompress using LZMA

SYNOPSIS
      use Compress::LZMA::External qw(compress decompress);
      my $compressed = compress($raw_data);
      my $decompressed = decompress($compressed_data);

      # you can also export these:
      my $compressed_fast = compress_fast($raw_data);
      my $compressed_best = compress_best($raw_data);

DESCRIPTION
    The Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm (LZMA) is an data compression
    algorithm. It compresses very well (better than gzip and bzip2),
    compresses very slowly (much slower than bzip2) but decompresses
    relatively quickly.

    This module is an interface to the lzma command-line program, available
    under Ubuntu with 'sudo apt-get install lzma'.
