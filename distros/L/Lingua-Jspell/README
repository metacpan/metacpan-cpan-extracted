 Lingua-Jspell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lingua-Jspell is a morphological analyser. Its first version were
distributed based on a C package with autoconf/automake/libtool
configuration. Given that main usage of Jspell is done through its Perl
interface, Jspell is now made available as a Perl module, that includes
the original C code unmodified.

For the installation you need a C compiler. The building tools will try
to detect it but it is not guaranteed that it will be correctly detected. 

For a windows installation we suggest the use of Strawberry Perl. Also,
if you are using latin1 languages, like Portuguese, change your command
prompt terminal to expect latin1:
 - 'chcp 1252' to change the codepage to a latin1 compatible one;
 - Configure the command prompt to use a True Type font.

Please refer to the documentation or http://natura.di.uminho.pt/ for
further details on Jspell usage and Jspell dictionaries.
