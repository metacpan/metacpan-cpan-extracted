        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    May 11 17:42:40 CEST 2007
        Disabled a test for Windows, because it failed due to perl features
        that are not available on Windows.

0.03    May 12 02:19:24 CEST 2007
        Update documentation

0.04    May 13 01:30:13 CEST 2007
        Added support for perl 5.9's caller's hinthash.
        Added by_index method to Devel::Backtrace::Point.

0.05    May 20 19:59:28 CEST 2007
        Make the tests work with perl 5.9

0.06    Mar 27 15:17:04 CET 2008
        Change the license to public domain.
        Added Devel::DollarAt.
        Added skipmysubs to Devel::Backtrace and called_package to
        Devel::Backtrace::Point.

0.07    Thu Mar 27 16:14:03 CET 2008
        Some minor changes (nothing in the code).

0.08    Sat Mar 29 18:43:42 CET 2008
        Added some documentation fixes.
        Previously, some tests were skipped in perl 5.6.  I made them work in
        5.6 and don't skip them any more.
        Previously, a test failed in 5.10 because perl 5.8 and 5.10 sometimes
        generate different line numbers in error messages.  I made the test
        work (see examples/dollarat.pl).

0.09    Sun Mar 30 16:08:25 CEST 2008
        Documentation fixes
        Added version to Devel::Backtrace::Point

0.10    Wed Apr  2 02:51:43 CEST 2008
        Format strings for stringification.
        Level information in Devel::Backtrace::Point.
        Fix a warning in examples/dollarat.pl in perl 5.10.
        Change the test system.  Previously it used to automatically run the
        examples, but now it's independent from the examples because that's
        more flexible.
        Again, added some fixes to make the tests work on all platforms.

0.11    Mon Jul  7 00:55:37 CEST 2008
        DBP is in the public domain too.  (Forgot that in 0.06)
        Fix a test that failed on Windows because of path separators.
        Add the Perl license as a fallback license...

0.11_01 Wed Jan 21 00:14:18 CET 2009
        Try again to make the test suite windows-compatible.

0.12    2009-01-27
        Non-dev release after 0.11_01 seemed fine with testers.
        Pod fix.
