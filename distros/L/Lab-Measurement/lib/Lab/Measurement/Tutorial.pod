Lab::Measurement::Tutorial - Lab::Measurement tutorial

=head1 VERSION

version 3.631

=head1 How to read the documentation

The documentation of Lab::Measurement can be read on MetaCPAN. The most
important starting points are

=over

=item * L<Lab::Measurement::Installation>

Detailed installation instructions.

=item * L<Lab::Measurement::Backends>

Overview of available back-ends.

=item * L<Lab::Measurement::Manual>

The table of contents referencing all manual pages.

=item * L<Lab::Measurement::Tutorial>

This tutorial.

=back

A old tutorial for the historical interfaces
L<Lab::Instrument> and L<Lab::XPRESS> is provided in
L<Lab::Measurement::OldTutorial>

=head1 Quickstart

In this quickstart we learn how to connect instruments and do simple
communication to change instrument settings and perform data acquisition.
In this example we use two simple instruments, the
HP/Agilent/Keysight 34410A digital multimeter (DMM) and the Stanford Research
SR830 lock-in amplifier. 

We cover the most important connection types and show how to use them on Linux
and Windows:

=over

=item * USB

This uses the USB-TMC protocol. Instruments are connected directly to the
measurement PC or via a hub. Very fast.

=item * Lan/VXI11

The recommended Lab-based protocol, if supported by the device, is VXI11.
Raw TCP sockets are also supported but do not provide the control commands of
VXI11, such as device clear. This is why VXI11 will be more seamless, if
available. You might have to create a private LAN to separate you lab devices
from the internet.

=item * GPIB

Old IEEE-488 bus. Only option for lots of old equipment in the lab.

=back

=head2 Connecting instruments on Linux

Lets use the Agilent DMM with USB on Linux. This requires the L<USB::TMC>
driver module installed.

 use 5.010;
 use Lab::Moose;

 my $multimeter = instrument(
     type => 'Agilent34410A',
     connection_type => 'USB',
 );

When connecting multiple devices of the same model via USB, we have to provide
serial numbers, which are unique for each device:

 my $multimeter1 = instrument(
     type => 'Agilent34410A',
     connection_type => 'USB',
     connection_options => {serial => '...'}
 );


 my $multimeter2 = instrument(
     type => 'Agilent34410A',
     connection_type => 'USB',
     connection_options => {serial => '...'}
 );

To use the LAN interface, set the C<connection_type> to I<VXI11> and
provide the instrument's IP address with the C<connection_options> hash:

 my $multimeter = instrument(
     type => 'Agilent34410A',
     connection_type => 'VXI11',
     connection_options => {host => '192.168.2.20'},
 );

We connect the SR830 lock-in amplifier via GPIB. This requires that the
LinuxGPIB kernel driver and perl bindings are installed as described in L<Lab::Measurement::Backends>.
The GPIB address (primary
address, short B<pad>), is provided in the C<connection_options> hash:

 my $lia = instrument(
     type => 'SR830',
     connection_type => 'LinuxGPIB',
     connection_options => {pad => 1},
 );

=head2 Connecting instruments on Windows

First thing, make sure that VISA is installed (L<Lab::VISA::Installation>).
I<VISA interactive control>, part of the VISA installation, can be used to
get a list of connected equipment.

We first connect the DMM via USB:

 use 5.010;
 use Lab::Moose;

 my $multimeter = instrument(
     type => 'Agilent34410A',
     connection_type => 'VISA::USB',
 );

To use the LAN interface, set the C<connection_type> to I<VISA::VXI11> and
provide the instrument's IP address with the C<connection_options> hash:

 my $multimeter = instrument(
     type => 'Agilent34410A',
     connection_type => 'VISA::VXI11',
     connection_options => {host => '192.168.2.20'},
 );

We connect the SR830 lock-in amplifier via GPIB. This requires that the
National Instruments' NI-488
driver is installed in addition to VISA. The GPIB address (primary
address, short B<pad>), is provided in the C<connection_options> hash:

 my $lia = instrument(
     type => 'SR830',
     connection_type => 'VISA::GPIB',
     connection_options => {pad => 1},
 );

=head2 Listening and talking to the devices

After initializing the multimeter with the C<instrument> function, let us
perform some basic operations

 # Perform *IDN? query, prints instrument model name
 say $multimeter->idn();

 # Set range to 10 Volts (if multimeter is in voltage mode)
 $multimeter->sense_range(value => 10);

 # Perform voltage measurement
 my $voltage = $multimeter->get_value();

And for the SR830 lock-in amplifier:

 # Set reference frequeny to 10kHz
 $lia->set_frq(value => 10e3);

 # Set output voltage amplitude to 0.5 V
 $lia->set_amplitude(value => 0.5);

 # Set sensitivity to 1mV
 $lia->set_sens(value => 1e-3);

 # Set filter slope to 18dB/oct
 $lia->set_filter_slope(value => 18);

 # Read x/y measurement data
 my $xy = $lia->get_xy();
 # Print contents of $xy hashref
 say "x = $xy->{x}, y = $xy->{y}";

=head1 More instrument drivers

Examples of more advanced types of instruments.
Note that when using sources (voltage, magnetic field, temperature) we will not interface
the instrument object directly. Instead we use the high-level sweep interfaces
described below. These provide a common API for creating both discrete and
continuous sweeps.

=head2 Voltage/Current source drivers

Far a voltage/current source, the instrument initialization requires several
additional parameters, which enforce step/rate limits to provide more safety.

 my $yoko = instrument(
     type => 'YokogawaGS200',
     connection_type => 'USB',
     max_units_per_step => 0.001,
     max_units_per_second => 0.01,
     min_units => -10,
     max_units => 10,
 );

Use C<set_level> to set output level to 9 Volts. The source will sweep with
stepsize and speed given by the max_units_per_step/max_units_per_second
parameters.

 $yoko->set_level(value => 9);

Read the new level value from cache:

 my $level = $yoko->cached_level();

=head2 Magnet power supplies

 my $ips = instrument(
     type => 'OI_Mercury::Magnet',
     connection_type => 'Socket',
     connection_options => {host => '192.168.3.15'},
 );

The following commands perform a continuous sweep of the magnetic field
from 0T to 0.5T with a rate of 0.1T/min

 # Set field setpoint and rate
 $ips->config_sweep(point => 0.5, rate => 0.1);

 # Start (trigger) sweep
 $ips->trg();

 # Show progress until sweep is finished
 $ips->wait();

A more high-level interface for creating continuous sweeps is described below.

=head2 Spectrum analyzers

The spectrum data is returned as a L<PDL> (2D).

 my $analyzer = instrument(
     type => 'RS_FSV',
     connection_type => 'VXI11',
     connection_options => {host => '...'},
 );
 
 # Set sweep start/stop frequencies
 $analyzer->sense_frequency_start(value => 1e9);
 $analyzer->sense_frequency_stop(value => 1e9);

 # Perform sweep, get data as PDL
 my $data = $analyzer->get_spectrum(timeout => 100);
 # Print data
 say $data;

You can always convert a PDL into an ordinary nested arrayref with C<unpdl>:

 my $arrayref_2D = $data->unpdl();

=head1 Sweeps, datafiles, and datafolders

=head2 Quickstart: Measuring an IV-curve

As a basic example of a 1D sweepm, we measure an IV curve:

 # file: IV.pl
 use Lab::Moose; # you get 'use warnings; use strict;' for free

 my $source = instrument(
     type            => 'YokogawaGS200',
     connection_type => 'USB',
     # Safety limits:
     max_units => 10, min_units => -10,
     max_units_per_step => 0.1, max_units_per_second => 1
 );

 my $dmm = instrument(type => 'Agilent34410A', connection_type => 'USB');

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type       => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $source,
     from => -5, to => 5, step => 0.01
 );

 my $datafile = sweep_datafile(columns => [qw/voltage current/]);

 my $meas = sub {
     my $sweep = shift;
     $sweep->log(
         voltage => $source->cached_level(),
         current => $dmm->get_value(),
     );
 };

 $sweep->start(
     measurement => $meas,
     datafile    => $datafile,
 );

Running this script repeatedly creates output folders F<MEAS_000>, F<MEAS_001>,
...
The folders contain the following files:

=over

=item * F<IV.pl>

Copy of the measurement script.

=item * F<META.yml>

YAML file with various metadata (time of script run, username, hostname, copy of the
used commandline, Lab::Measurement version, ...).

=item * F<data.dat>

Gnuplot-style datafile:

 # voltage        current
 -5               42
 -4.99            43
 ...

=back

=head3 Backsweeps

To also measure the IV in the reverse direction from -5 to 5 volts, we add the
C<backsweep> option:

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type       => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $source,
     from => -5, to => 5, step => 0.01,
     backsweep  => 1,
 );

=head2 The datafolder

You can change the name of the datafolder by providing a C<folder> argument to
the C<start> method:

 $sweep->start(
     measurement => $meas,
     datafile    => $datafile,
     folder      => 'IV_curve'
 );

This will create output folders with names F<IV_curve_xxx>.

=head2 Multiple datafiles

We can create multiple datafiles:

 my $datafile1 = sweep_datafile(
     filename => 'data1',
     columns  => [qw/voltage current/]
 );
 my $datafile2 = sweep_datafile(
     filename => 'data2',
     columns  => [qw/voltage current/]
 );

 $sweep->start(
     measurement => $meas,
     datafiles   => [$datafile1, $datafile2],
     folder      => 'IV_curve'
 );

And in the C<$meas> subroutine, call the sweeps's C<log> method for both datafiles:

 my $meas = sub {
     my $sweep = shift;
     my $voltage = $source->cached_level();
     $sweep->log(
         datafile => $datafile1,
         voltage  => $voltage,
         current  => $dmm1->get_value(),
     );
     $sweep->log(
         datafile => $datafile2,
         voltage  => $voltage,
         current  => $dmm2->get_value()
    );
 };

=head2 Multi-dimensional sweeps: Datafile dimensions and filename extensions

=head3 2D sweeps

Let us start with a simple 2D sweep: we sweep a gate voltage (outer sweep) and
a bias voltage and again measure a current:

 use Lab::Moose;

 # As we use two Yokogawa's, we need to provide USB serial IDs
 my $gate_source = instrument(
     type               => 'YokogawaGS200',
     connection_type    => 'USB',
     connection_options => {serial => '...'},
     # Safety limits:
     max_units => 10, min_units => -10,
     max_units_per_step => 0.1, max_units_per_second => 1
 );

 my $bias_source = instrument(
     type               => 'YokogawaGS200',
     connection_type    => 'USB',
     connection_options => {serial => '...'},
     # Safety limits:
     max_units => 10, min_units => -10,
     max_units_per_step => 0.1, max_units_per_second => 1
 );

 my $dmm = instrument(type => 'Agilent34410A', connection_type => 'USB');

 my $gate_sweep = sweep(
     type       => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $gate_source,
     from => 0, to => 1, step => 0.1
 );

 my $bias_sweep = sweep(
     type       => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $bias_source,
     from => 0, to => 1, step => 0.1
 );

 my $datafile = sweep_datafile(columns => [qw/gate bias current/]);

 my $meas = sub {
     my $sweep = shift;
     my $v_gate = $gate_source->cached_level();
     my $v_bias = $bias_source->cached_level();
     $sweep->log(
         gate    => $v_gate,
         bias    => $v_bias,
         current => $dmm->get_value(),
     );
 };

 $gate_sweep->start(
     slave       => $bias_sweep,
     measurement => $meas,
     datafile    => $datafile,
 );

By default, this will create a 2D block datafile:

 # gate    bias    current
 0         0       x
 0         0.1     x
 0         0.2     x
 ...
 0         1       x

 0.1       0       x
 0.1       0.1     x
 0.1       0.2     x
 ...
 ...

 1         0       x
 ...
 1         1       x

Alternatively, we can create multiple 1D datafiles, one for each value of the
gate voltage. We do this by setting the C<datafile_dim> parameter to 1:

 $gate_sweep->start(
     slave        => $bias_sweep,
     measurement  => $meas,
     datafile     => $datafile,
     datafile_dim => 1
 );

The output files will be F<<data_Voltage=0.dat, data_Voltage=0.1.dat, ...,
data_Voltage=1.dat>> We can customize the F<Voltage=> part in the datafile
names by providing a
B<filename extension> in the gate sweep:

 my $gate_sweep = sweep(
     type               => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument         => $gate_source,
     from => 0, to => 1, step => 0.1,
     filename_extension => 'Gate=',
 );

=head3 Higher dimensional sweeps

If we create sweeps setups with dimension > 2, the maximum datafile dimension
remains 2. E.g. if we create a 3D sweep [Temperature, Gate, Bias], a 2D
datafile will be created for each value of the temperature sweep.
If we set C<datafile_dim> to 1, a subfolder will be created for each value of
the temperature and the subfolders contain 1D datafiles for each gate voltage.

FIXME: link to example script.

=head2 Live plotting

=head3 Line plots

Let us add a simple line plot to our IV measurement:

 my $datafile = sweep_datafile(columns => [qw/voltage current/]);
 
 $datafile->add_plot(
     x => 'voltage',
     y => 'current',
 );

This will create a live line plot, which will be updated for each new data
point. A copy of the plot will be saved in the output folder in png format with
filename C<"$datafile.png">. You can change this filename with the
C<hard_copy> option:

 $datafile->add_plot(
     x         => 'voltage',
     y         => 'current',
     hard_copy => 'data.png',
 );

=head3 Color maps (3D plots)

Let us add a color plot to the gate/bias 2D sweep:

 my $datafile = sweep_datafile(columns => [qw/gate bias current/]);
 
 $datafile->add_plot(
     type => 'pm3d',
     x    => 'gate',
     y    => 'bias',
     z    => 'current'
 );

By default, the live plot will be updated after a bias sweep is completed.

=head3 Terminal options

If we don't want to use gnuplot's default terminal for the live plot or hard copy,
we use the C<terminal>, C<hard_copy_terminal>, C<terminal_options> and
C<hard_copy_terminal_options> options:

 $datafile->add_plot(
     type                       => 'pm3d',
     x                          => 'gate',
     y                          => 'bias',
     z                          => 'current',
     terminal                   => 'x11',
     terminal_options           => {linewidth => 3},
     hard_copy                  => 'data.jpg',
     hard_copy_terminal         => 'jpeg',
     hard_copy_terminal_options => {linewidth => 0.5}
 ); 

=head3 Plot and curve options

L<PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot> separates between plot options and curve options:

 $datafile->add_plot(
     type => 'pm3d',
     x    => 'gate',
     y    => 'bias',
     z    => 'current',
     plot_options => {
         title   => 'x - y plot',
         xlabel  => 'x (V)',
         ylabel  => 'y (V)',
         cblabel => 'current (A)', # label for color box
         format  => {x => "'%.2e'", y => "'%.2e'"},
         grid    => 0, # disable grid
     },
     curve_options => {
         with      => 'lines', # default is 'points'
         linetype  => 2, # color
         linewidth => 2,
     },
 );      

More Plot and curve options are documented in L<PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot>.

=head2 Block data

There are types of instruments which return more than a single data. Examples
are spectrum and network analyzers, which perform a frequency sweep and return
an array of data after each sweep.

The C<sparam_sweep> method provided, e.g., by the
L<Lab::Moose::Instrument::RS_ZVA> returns a 2D PDL with the following format:

 [
  [freq1    , freq2    , ..., freqN    ],
  [Re(S11)_1, Re(S11)_2, ..., Re(S11)_N],
  [Im(S11)_1, Im(S11)_2, ..., Im(S11)_N],
  [Amp_1    , Amp_2    , ..., Amp_N    ],
  [phase_1  , phase_2  , ..., phase_N  ],
 ]

The following script sweeps a voltage source and performs a frequency sweep
with the VNA for each level of the voltage source. Each VNA sweep is logged
into a separate datafile which contains one line of data for each frequency
point.

 use Lab::Moose;

 my $source = instrument(
     type            => 'YokogawaGS200',
     connection_type => 'USB',
     # Safety limits:
     max_units => 10, min_units => -10,
     max_units_per_step => 0.1, max_units_per_second => 1
 );

 my $vna = instrument(
     type               => 'RS_ZVA',
     connection_type    => 'VXI11',
     connection_options => {host => '192.168.x.x'},
 );

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $source,
     from => -5, to => 5, step => 0.01
 );

 my $datafile = sweep_datafile(
     columns => [qw/voltage freq Re_S21 Im_S21 amplitude phase/]);

 my $meas = sub {
     my $sweep = shift;
     my $voltage = $source->cached_level();
     my $block = $vna->sparam_sweep(timeout => 10, average => 100);

     $sweep->log_block(
         prefix => {voltage => $voltage},
         block => $block
     );
 };

 $sweep->start(
     measurement => $meas,
     datafile   => $datafile,
     datafile_dim => 1, # each VNA trace in a separate file
     point_dim => 1, # the measurement sub logs blocks, not points
 );

Without the C<< point_dim => 1 >> setting, only one datafile would be
generated. One could also log all blocks into a single 2D datafile by setting
C<< datafile_dim => 2 >>.

=head2 Continuous sweeps

With continuous sweeps, the sweep parameter is ramped in the background while
data is recorded. This is in constrast with step/list sweeps where the sweep
parameter is kept constant during data acquisition.
The rate of measurement points taken is controlled by the C<interval> sweep
attribute.

For example, the following time sweep records data every 0.5 seconds and
finishes after 60 seconds:

 use Lab::Moose;

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type => 'Continuous::Time',
     interval => 0.5,
     duration => 60
 );

=head3 Configuration of continuous sweeps

In this example we sweep a magnet field with the C<Continuous::Magnet> sweep
class. All subclasses of C<Continuous> work like this.

Note that the rate is given in Tesla/min.

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type => 'Continuous::Magnet',
     instrument => $ips,
     from => -1, # Tesla
     to => 1,
     rate => 0.1, # (Tesla/min, always positive)
     start_rate => 1, # (optional, rate to approach start point)
     interval => 0.5, # one measurement every 0.5 seconds
 );

If the sweep should use different rates in different sections, use the
C<points>, C<rates>, and C<intervals> arguments:

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type => 'Continuous::Magnet',
     instrument => $ips,
     points => [-1, -0.1, 0.1, 1],
     # start rate: 1
     # use slow rate 0.01 between points -0.1 and 0.1
     rates => [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.1], 
     intervals => [0.5], # one measurement every 0.5 seconds
 );

If the C<rates> array contains fewer elements than the C<points> array, it will
be filled with the last value.

If no C<interval> or C<intervals> parameter is provided a default of 0 is used.
With an interval of 0, as many data points as possible are recorded without any
delay between the measurement points.

=head2 Further sweep customizations

=head3 The delay_before_loop, delay_in_loop, and delay_after_loop attributes

These attributes can be used to introduce delays into a sweep:

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type       => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $source,
     from => -5, to => 5, step => 0.01,
     delay_before_loop => 1.5,
     delay_in_loop => 0.1,
     delay_after_loop => 2.5,
 );

With C<delay_before_loop> set, the sweep will sleep 1.5 seconds before
starting the sweep (after going to the start point of the sweep). With
C<delay_in_loop> set, there is a sleep between going to the setpoint and
calling the measurement subroutine. The C<delay_after_loop> causes a delay
between finishing the sweep and going back to the start point.

=head3 The before_loop coderef

The C<before_loop> coderef is used to execute arbitrary code at the start of a sweep:

 my $before_loop = sub {
     print("will start loop now\n");
 };

 my $sweep = sweep(
     type       => 'Step::Voltage',
     instrument => $source,
     from => -5, to => 5, step => 0.01,
     before_loop => $before_loop,
 );

The C<$before_loop> code is called after a possible C<delay_before_loop> delay.
