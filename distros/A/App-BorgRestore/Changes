Revision history for Perl extension App-BorgRestore

3.4.4 2020-10-14T12:37:04Z
	- Require DBD::SQLite 1.60 or newer to fix issues with schema migration 2
	  on old systems.
	- Reduce database size for databases that contained data from before
	  migrations 3 and 4.

3.4.3 2020-09-27T13:53:54Z

3.4.2 2020-09-27T13:50:47Z
	- Fix missing cache data for top level files that exist with and without an
	  extension. For example a '/lib' symlink and '/lib64'. '/lib' would be
	  missing from the database.

3.4.1 2020-09-27T12:57:01Z
	- Fix missing cache data for files that exist with and without an
	  extension. For example '/home/*/.ssh/id_rsa' would be missing from the

	  in the database.
