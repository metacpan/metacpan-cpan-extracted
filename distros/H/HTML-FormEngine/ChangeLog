0.7
---
	
Till version 0.6.1 gaff was an php tool. When i started programming perl
and recognized that it is much more powerfull than php, i ported gaff to
perl. I completly rewrote it and thereby added many new features:

	- flexible template engine for writing skins
	- check routines with translatable error messages (using gettext)
	- a more modular design, so that gaff can easily be extended and
	enhanced
	- a more detailed documentation

packaging the 0.7.3 release. CPAN doesn't like this.

0.7.4

	bottom, independend of wether a variable, a handler call, a loop
	etc. is found

	- redesign: skins are now represented by classes
	- because of that the following methods are not in FormEngine anymore:
	    - set_skin
	    - add_skin
	    - set_default
	    - add_default
	    - set_handler
	    - add_handler
	    - add_checks
	    - set_confirm_skin
	    - add_confirm_skin
	    - set_confirm_handler
	    - add_confirm_handler
	- instead they're replaced by methods of the skin classes. see MIGRATING for more.

	- template system extended:
	       - handler calls can now be nested
	       - loops without loop variables loop over all variables in the loops body
	- the "check_uniq" template and the "emb_text" template don't exist anymore
	- new templates: select_flexible, select_optgroup, optgroup, optgroup_flexible, fieldset, print_option
	- all handlers have been renamed, you have to add a '#' infront of the old names.
	- new handlers:
	     - #gettext_var for translating the contents of a template variable
	     - #label for generating a label tag
	     - #decide
