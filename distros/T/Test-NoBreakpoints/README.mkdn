# NAME

Test::NoBreakpoints - test that files do not contain soft breakpoints

# VERSION

version 0.15

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test::NoBreakpoints;
    plan tests => $num_tests;
    no_breakpoints_ok( $file, 'Contains no soft breakpoints' );

Module authors can include the following in a t/nobreakpoints.t file to add
such checking to a module distribution:

    use Test::More;
    eval "use Test::NoBreakpoints 0.10";
    plan skip_all => "Test::NoBreakpoints 0.10 required for testing" if $@;
    all_files_no_breakpoints_ok();

# DESCRIPTION

I love soft breakpoints (`$DB::single = 1`) in the Perl debugger. 
Unfortunately, I have a habit of putting them in my code during development
and forgetting to take them out before I upload it to CPAN, necessitating a
hasty fix/package/bundle cycle followed by much cursing.

Test::NoBreakpoints checks that files contain neither the string
`$DB::single = 1` nor `$DB::signal = 1`.  By adding such a test to all my
modules, I swear less and presumably lighten the load on the CPAN in some
small way.

# FUNCTIONS

Unless otherwise noted, all functions are tests built on top of
Test::Builder, so the standard admonition about having made a plan before
you run them apply.

## no_breakpoints_ok($file, [$description] )

Checks that $file contains no breakpoints.  If the optional $description is
not passed it defaults to "no breakpoint test of $file".

If the test fails, the line number of the file where the breakpoint was
found will be emitted.

For compatibility with old versions of this module, the deprecated name
`no_brkpts_ok` may also be used (but see ["DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS"](#DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS)).

## all_perl_files( [@dirs] )

Returns a list of all `*.pl`, `*.pm` and `*.t` files in the directories
listed.  If `@dirs` is not passed, defaults to `blib` and `t`.

The order of the files returned is machine-dependent.  If you want them
sorted, you'll have to sort them yourself.

## all_files_no_breakpoints_ok( [@files] )

Checks all files that look like they contain Perl using no_breakpoints_ok(). If
`@files` is not provided, it defaults to the return of __all_perl_files()__.

For compatibility with old versions of this module, the deprecated name
`all_files_no_brkpts_ok` may also be used (but see ["DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS"](#DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS)).

# EXPORTS

By default __all_files_no_breakpoints_ok__ and __no_breakpoints_ok__.

For the time being, the deprecated forms the above
(__all_files_no_brkpts_ok__ and __no_brkpts_ok__) are also exported (but see
["DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS"](#DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS)).

On request, __all_perl_files__.

Everything with the tag __:all__.

# DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS

Prior to v0.13 of this module, no_breakpoints_ok was called no_brkpts_ok and
all_files_no_breakpoints_ok was similarly abbreviated.

In v0.13, these older names were deprecated.  They are still exported by
default, but will emit a warning unless you disable the __deprecated__
lexical warning category:

    {
      no warnings 'deprecated';
      no_brkpts_ok(...);
    }

In the next release, the deprecated functions will have to be pulled in via
an import tag.  In the release after that, they will cease to be.

logic of __all_perl_files__ from.

# BUGS

- doesn't catch some breakpoints

This is a valid breakpoint:

    package DB;
    $single = 1;
    package main;

as is this:

    my $break = \$DB::single;
    $$break = 1;

but neither are currently caught.

# TODO

- enhance regex to find esoteric setting of breakpoints

If you have a legitimate breakpoint set that isn't caught, please send me an
example and I'll try to augment the regex to match it.

- only look at code rather than the entire file

This is not as easy as simply stripping out POD, because there might be
inline tests or examples that are code in there (using Test::Inline).
Granted, those should be caught when the generated .t files are themselves
tested, but I'd like to make it smarter.

- not use regular expressions

The ideal way to find a breakpoint would be to compile the code and then
walk the opcode tree to find places where the breakpoint is set. 
B::FindAmpersand does something similar to this to find use of the `$&` in
regular expressions, so this is probably the direction I'm going to head in.
