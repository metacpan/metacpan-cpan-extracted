NAME
    Options - A perl module to provide better support for command-line
    option parsing, hopefully better than GetOpts.

SYNOPSIS
            use Options;
        
            $options = new Options(params => [
                                                            ['port', 'p', undef, 'The port to connect to.'],
                                                            ['host', 'h', 'localhost', 'The host to connect to.']
                                                            ],
                                                            flags =>  [
                                                            ['secure', 's', 'Use SSL for encryption.'],
                                                            ['quit', 'q', 'Quit after connecting.'],
                                                            ]);
        
            # Parse the default option source (@ARGV)
            %results = $options->get_options();
        
            # Provide usage
            if($options->get_result('help')){
                    $options->print_usage();
                    exit(1);
            }

DESCRIPTION
     Options was created to somewhat emulate the syntax of the Twisted Python's
     core usage library of the same name. It provides a parser for command-line
     options that is integrated with an automatic usage generator. Support exists
     for both flags and parameters, in long and short form, required parameters,
     and default params.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

GETTING OPTIONS
    new Options()
         Create a new instance of the Options class. To do so, pass the constructor
         two optional, named arguments. 'params' are command-line switches with
         arguments, while flags are boolean switches. (duh.)

         Each argument consists of an anonymous array reference which contains
         an anonymous array for each option you wish to support.

         Params arrays must be four elements long, consisting of the long and short
         versions of the switch, a default value, and a description to be printed in
         the usage guide. If the default value is specified as "undef", it becomes a
         required value, and the program will not continue without it. Options without
         defaults can specify the empty string ("") to omit the default.

         Flags arrays are simpler, and omit the default element.

    $options->get_options()
         This method is called with no arguments, and begins the parsing of
         the global variable @ARGV, or an array passed as the first argument
         to the function. When finished, it returns a hash where the
         keys are the long option names, and the values are the result of the
         parse, i.e., strings for params, and boolean values (1 or 0 actually)
         for flag-type options.

         If the parser encounters an unknown flag, or a bare word without a
         recognized switch before it, these are left in the @ARV array in the
         order they are found, so that a script can do additional processing of
         @ARGV.

         If the result is missing a required parameter, the module prints the
         usage table, and exits with a 1 status code.

    $options->get_result(option)
         Although get_options returns a hash, and that is an
         acceptable way to use the results, this function provides
         some level of convenience when dealing with options that
         may return a reference to a list of results for that option.
         When called in a list context, this will return a list of
         results, even if only one argument was provided.
         However, calling it in a scalar context when there are
         multiple arguments will be, shall we say, disappointing.

    $options->print_usage($optional_message)
         Options will automatically display usage information if a required
         parameter is omitted, but this method can be used to implement a
         --help parameter.
