0.16 Mon Jan 20 22:11:24 EST 2025
	- fixes for modern Perl.

0.15 Sun Jul  2 23:37:37 EDT 2006
	- added "use encoding 'utf8';" to test script to avoid warns.
	- added Regexp::Ethiopic::isFamilyOf method to check if to chars are in the same family.
	- added support for family equivalence where in [=#x#=] the "x" can be a list.
	- tweaked syllabic limitter notation so that in x{#3,7#} the "x" can be other than the Ge'ez form.
	
0.14 Sun May 30 13:12:50 EDT 2004
	- updated limit notation to match range notation.

0.13 Sat Nov  8 16:49:08 EST 2003
	- added more to documentation doc/index.html.
	- Removed %GeezClassEquivalence since it isn't used.
	- Removed test 31 from overload.pl, its either a typo or I
	  don't know what I was thinking...

0.12 Mon Jun 12 17:52:22 EDT 2003
	- added Tigrigna and Ge'ez modules.
	- changed rule to replace [=x=] with x if x is ethiopic and an
	  unknown class.

0.11 Mon Jun  2 10:17:58 EDT 2003
	- added :utils export option for all functions.
	- added documentation for export functions.
	- added examples/utils.pl.
	- added new function "formatForms" (like sprintf for syllables).
	- added the "o" optimizer everywhere applicable,
	  lets hope this doesn't break anything.
	- Changed \p{InEthiopic} to \p{Ethiopic} which (I think) will
	  match only Ethiopic letter chars.

0.10 Mon May19 12:33:39 EDT 2003
	- fixed "subForm" export problem in Regexp::Ethiopic::Amharic,
	  an oversite from the 0.09 release.

0.09 Sun May 18 05:12:46 EDT 2003
	- addition of "subForm".

0.08 Sat Apr 19 11:50:38 EDT 2003
	- tweaked RE language so that the % operator must appear inside {}.
          Which is a simplification for interpretation, %'s scope as an operator
          is now restricted, this should fit in with traditional REs more readily.

0.07 Thu Apr 17 12:04:45 EDT 2003
	- a one char doc fix.

0.06 Sat Apr 12 21:23:09 EDT 2003

	  other packages.

	  names for the Ethiopic letter forms and their numeric value.
	- fixed examples at end of examples/overload.pl
	- documentation fixes.

	- added sat-sewt family equivalence that was overlooked.
	- fixed comma between letters problem with a zero width insertion. 

0.03 Mon Mar 17 15:30:26 EST 2003
	- ranges added for forms equivalence.
	- ranges added for family equivalence.

0.02 Mon Mar 17 09:33:06 EST 2003
	- overloading and functional use play together nicely.
	- "use utf8" statement moved outside of "BEGIN" block.
