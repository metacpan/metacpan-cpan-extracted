Revision history for App::papersway

2.001     2025-04-28 10:16:43+08:00 Asia/Shanghai
    - Make 'other-column' not do anything when there is only a single column,
      regardless of whether that column itself is wide.

2.000     2025-04-01 11:49:09+08:00 Asia/Shanghai
    - New wide windows replace monocle mode.
      'width toggle' command replaces 'monocle toggle'.
      Prompted by some feedback from PaperWM user Joey Hess.
    - New 'bury-workspace' command.
    - New --cols option.
    - Rename 'absorb_expel' command to 'absorb-expel'.
    - Rename 'move_workspace' command to 'move-to-workspace'.
    - Rename 'other column' command to 'other-column'.

    - 'other-column' command does nothing when a wide window is displayed.
      Its operation in that case is too different to be of much use, I think.
    - Update status display when moving column left/right with a wide window.
    - Fix an operator precedence mistake in the normalisation routine.
    - Fix skipping the current line of i3status output upon decoding error.
    - Don't hide Sway's workspace buttons when in debug mode.
    - Don't allow sending columns with rows to fresh workspaces.
    - Fix moving previously-hidden containers to a fresh workspace on reload.
    - Fix pulling multiple columns from the right when some have >1 row.

    - papersway(1): Fix sample $mod+Shift+Right binding.
      Thanks to Joey Hess for the report.
    - papersway(1): Add missing '--debug' to synopsis.

    - Update --i3status output when title of the caffeinated window changes.
    - Don't allow reducing the number of columns below two.
      If you reduce to a single column accidentally, it's confusing.

    - Clear caffeinated status when we receive a close event for the
      caffeinated window.
    - Fix unconditionally disabling monocle mode when switching to a fresh
      workspace.

    - Reduce resize flickering when moving along the row of windows.
