2.23 Sun Aug 28 11:30:33 CEST 2016
	- relative redirects used the proxy schema instead of the request
          url schema to generate the new url, which is wrong (analyzed by Felix
          Ostmann).
        - fix download example (reported by Felix Ostmann).

2.22 Thu May 14 04:04:03 CEST 2015
	- ipv6 literals were not correctly parsed (analyzed by Raphael Geissert).
	- delete the body when mutating request to GET request when
          redirecting (reported by joe trader).
        - send proxy-authorization header to proxy when using CONNECT
          (reported by dzagashev@gmail.com).
	- do not send Proxy-Authroization header when not using a proxy.
	- when retrying a persistent request, switch persistency off.
        - added t/02_ip_literals.t.

2.21 Mon Jun  9 01:35:54 CEST 2014
	- correctly keep body when redirecting POSTs, instead of
          deleting them.

2.2  Mon Jun  9 01:31:46 CEST 2014
	- connection header was malformed (patch by Raphael Geissert).
	- add lots of known idempotent methods from httpbis.
        - implement relative location headers (rfc 7231), with fallback on URI.
        - add support for status code 308 from rfc 7238.
        - recommend URI.

2.15 Wed Nov 14 23:22:07 CET 2012
	- use the recurse parameter to also limit the number of retries to be
          done, avodiing endless loops with broken servers, as reported
          by Carl Chambers.

2.14 Sun Apr 22 14:57:51 CEST 2012
	- Time::Local::timegm croaks on out-of-range values. Don't let
          this disturb AnyEvent::HTTP (reported by: tell me, I forgot...).

2.13 Wed Jul 27 17:53:58 CEST 2011
	- garbled chunked responses caused AnyEvent::HTTP to malfunction
          (patch by Dmitri Melikyan).
        - fix GET => HEAD in one case in the documentation (James Bromberger).

2.12 Tue Jun 14 07:22:54 CEST 2011
	- fix a possible 'Can't call method "destroyed"' error (which would
          have been reported by Carl Chambers).

2.11 Tue May 10 14:33:28 CEST 2011
	- the keepalive session cache wouldn't take port and scheme into account
          when reusing connection - potentially causing information leaks
          (reported by Nick Kostirya).
	- bump AnyEvent dependency version (reported by Richard Harris).

2.1  Thu Feb 24 13:11:51 CET 2011
	- the keepalive and persistent parameters were actually named
          differently in the code - they now work as documented.
        - fix a bug where callbacks would sometimes never be called when
          the request timeout is near or below the persistent connection
          timeout (testcase by Cindy Wang).
        - destroying the guard would have no effect when a request was
          recursing or being retired.

2.04 Sat Feb 19 07:45:24 CET 2011
	- "proxy => undef" now overrides any global proxy when specified.
        - require scheme in urls, also use a stricter match to match urls,
          leading or trailing garbage is no longer tolerated.
        - EXPERIMENTAL: allow '=' in cookie values.

2.03 Tue Jan 18 18:49:35 CET 2011
	- dummy reupload, file gone from cpan somehow.

2.02 Wed Jan 12 04:29:37 CET 2011
	- do not lowercase cookie names, only parameter names.

2.01 Tue Jan 11 07:38:15 CET 2011
	- add missing dependency on common::sense.
        - add a resume download example.

2.0  Tue Jan  4 09:16:56 CET 2011
	- hopefully fully upgraded to HTTP/1.1.
        - support HTTP/1.1 persistent and HTTP/1.0 keep-alive connections.
	- drop https-proxy-connection support. seems unused and ill-specified.
        - use more differentiated 59x status codes.
        - properly use url (not proxy) hostname to verify server certificate.
        - much improved cookie implementation:
           - properly implement cookie expiry (for new cookies).
           - new function to expire cookies and sessions: cookie_jar_expire.
           - add special exception to parse broken expires= keys in
             set-cookie headers.
           - do not quote cookie values when not strictly necessary, to
             improve compatibility with broken servers.
           - accept and send lots of invalid cookie values exactly as
             they were received - this should not impact valid values.
           - lowercase cookie parameter names for improved compatibility.
           - support the max-age cookie parameter, overrides expires.
           - support cookie dates (and a few others) in parse_date.
           - properly support value-less parameters (e.g. secure, httponly).
        - do not send Host: header in a proxy CONNECT request.
	- use common::sense.
        - lowercase hostnames and schemes.
        - ignore leading zeroes in http version.
        - handle spaces in content-length headers more gracefully.

1.5  Fri Dec 31 04:47:08 CET 2010
	- bugfix: after headers were received, if any error occured the wrong
          (server-sent) Status and Reason fields would be passed to the callback.
        - when an error occurs during transfer, preserve status/reason.
	- add socks4a connect example.
	- new "tcp_connect" parameter.
        - new format_date and parse_date functions.
        - diagnose unexpected eof as such when the length is known.
        - add 205 to the responses without body.

1.46 Mon Sep  6 08:29:34 CEST 2010
        - some (broken) servers differentiate between empty search parts
          and nonexistant search parts, work around this (problem
          analyzed by Sergey Zasenko).
        - possibly increase robustness by always setting an on_error
          callback on the AnyEvent::Handle object (especially in case
          of user errors, such as nehative timeouts).
        - we now always follow 301/302/303 redirects and mutate POST to GET.
        - we now always follow 307 redirects, even for POST.
        - header-less responses are not parsed correctly (at a negative
          speed penatly :).

1.45 Wed Jun 16 21:15:26 CEST 2010
	- fix a bug where the handle would go away directly after a successful
          connect (analyzed and patch by Maxim Dounin).
        - due to popular demand, introduce the Redirect pseudo response header.
        - document URL pseudo-header better.
        - explain how to implement DNS caching.

1.44 Sat Dec  5 16:36:20 CET 2009
	- do not generate content-length on get requests (if the body is empty),
          as there are even more broken servers out there.
	- allow set_proxy to clear the proxy again.
        - set_proxy will now croak on invalid urls.
        - support overriding the Host-header (requested by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa).

1.43 Fri Aug 14 17:02:02 CEST 2009
	- provide on_prepare callback on common request.

1.42 Wed Aug  5 18:43:01 CEST 2009
	- allow suppression of auto-supplied header fields by specifying undef
          (requested by Mr Guest).
        - allow proxy scheme to be missing, as documented
          (reported by Mr Guest).
        - do not follow redirects if we do not have a location header
          (requested by Mr Guest).

1.41 Sat Jul 25 03:27:05 CEST 2009
	- correctly parse completely headerless responses (e.g. by gatling).
          (analysed by Robin Redeker).

1.4  Tue Jul  7 02:14:53 CEST 2009
	- http_request would not instantly clear the connection slot on
          tcp_connect failures, potentially leading to deadlocks.
        - fix a bug where a connection error is wrongly reported
          as EINPROGRESS.
        - new parameters: on_header, on_body, want_body_handle.
        - redirects will be followed when recurse is enabled whether or not
          the body dowload was successful or not.
        - include :port in Host header when given in the url (many sites break
          when it's always there, and many break if it's missing...).
        - pass the empty string, not undef, when there is no body but
          no error occured.
        - allow passing of tls_ctx, predefine two https security profiles.
	- ucfirst all error messages generated internally.
        - include "U" token in User-Agent.
        - document $AnyEvent::HTTP::MAX_PER_HOST.
        - allow empty field names in response headers (microsoft hits. microsoft
          hits. microsoft hits. you die).

1.12 Thu Jun 11 14:45:18 CEST 2009
	- $scheme wasn't optional in the proxy specification (reported by
          Felix Antonius Wilhelm Ostmann).

1.11 Fri Nov 21 09:18:11 CET 2008
	- work around a perl core bug not properly refcounting function arguments,
          causing "200 OK" with random body results (reported by Дмитрий Шалашов).

1.1  Thu Oct 30 04:46:27 CET 2008
	- work around different behaviour of AnyEvent::Handle in TLS mode.
	- cleanup cookie implementation, many examples and comments were
          provided by Дмитрий Шалашов.
        - document the return values of http_* functions better.
        - separate multiple header values by "," not "\x00" (this does not
          break correctly written users of the old API).
        - improve Set-Cookie: parsing.
        - add experimental https-over-http-proxy support.
        - downgrade https-over-https proxy to https-over-http.
        - ignore spurious CR characters in headers, they show up
          in the weirdest of places.
        - ucfirst the request headers, for a slightly less weird look.
        - work around (some) memleaks in perl regarding qr.

1.05 Mon Sep 29 15:49:58 CEST 2008
	- fix a regex when parsing cookie domains
          (patch by Дмитрий Шалашов).

1.04 Thu Jul 24 08:00:46 CEST 2008
        - parse reason-less http status responses.
	- parse more forms of broken location headers.

1.03 Thu Jul  3 03:47:58 CEST 2008
	- fix http_post, which was totally broken (patch by Pedro Melo).
        - do not recurse on POST requests, as per HTTP/1.[01] (this might
          change as the recommendation isn't followed by anybody else).
        - implement preliminary support for 303/307 redirects.

1.02 Thu Jun 12 13:50:08 CEST 2008
        - make the request URL available in the callback of http_request.
	- export http_post, http_head.

1.01 Fri Jun  6 14:56:37 CEST 2008
        - fixed prototypes for http_* functions

1.0  Thu Jun  5 20:41:43 CEST 2008
	- original version, an AnyEvent::AIO clone.
