NAME
    Method::Cascade - Use method chaining with any API

SYNOPSIS
        use Method::Cascade;
        use IO::Socket::INET;

        cascade(IO::Socket::INET->new('google.com:http'))
          ->timeout(5)
          ->setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_KEEPALIVE, pack("l", 1))
          ->print("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n")
          ->recv(my $response, 4096);

        print $response;

BACKGROUND
    Method chaining is a very intuitive and convenient way to make
    sequential method calls on the same object.

    Unfortunately, not all APIs support method chaining. In order for an API
    to be chainable, every method must return $self. However often there are
    good reasons for an API to not return $self. For instance, it can be
    useful for setter methods to return the previous values.

    Method cascading is a feature borrowed from Smalltalk. Its advantage is
    that any API can be used in a chained fashion, even if the designers
    didn't plan or intend for it to be chainable. You, the user of the API,
    can choose if you care about the return values and, if not, go ahead and
    cascade method calls.

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports one function: "cascade". You should pass it the
    object that you would like to chain/cascade method calls on. It will
    return a wrapper object that forwards all method calls to the object you
    passed in. After forwarding, it returns the same wrapper object.

    Because return values are ignored (the methods are in fact called in
    void context), method cascading is most useful when used with APIs that
    throw exceptions instead of returning error values. For instance, with
    DBI, as long as "RaiseError" is true and "AutoCommit" is false you can
    safely do the following:

        cascade($dbh)->do("INSERT INTO admins (name) VALUES (?)", undef, $user)
                     ->do("DELETE FROM users WHERE name=?", undef, $user)
                     ->commit;

OTHER LANGUAGES
    As mentioned, method cascading was first invented in Smalltalk.

    Dart <https://www.dartlang.org/> is a web-language that has also added
    this feature. In Dart, the ".." operator is a method cascading operator
    that returns the object the method was invoked on instead of the method
    call result. Here is a Dart example:

        myTokenTable
          ..add("aToken")
          ..add("anotherToken")
          // and on and on
          ..add("theUmpteenthToken");
