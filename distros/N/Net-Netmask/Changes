 - Some speed improvements from Todd R. Eigenschink <todd at tekinteractive.com>

1.9009 2004-04-12

 - Fix to netmasks.t for compatability with older perls

1.9008 2004-04-06

 - Added cidrs2inverse() which will find the gaps in a list of blocks.
 - Based on a request from Howard Jones <howard.jones at network-i.net>
   the tag() method was added.  It allows you to store your own data in
   a Net::Netmask object.  (Of course, you could have anyway as long as you
   didn't use the keys 'IBASE' or 'BITS')
 - Long ago, Alexandros M Manoussakis <amm2 at ini.cmu.edu> reported a bug
   that findAllNetblock would often return the same block multiple times.  
   Fixed.
 - Based on requests from Alexandros M Manoussakis <amm2 at ini.cmu.edu>
   and Lamprecht Andreas <andreas.a.lamprecht at siemens.com> the
   undefined behavior for overlapping blocks with cidrs2contiglists
   is no longer.  Such blocks will be in the same sublist.
 - Based on a requests from Tom Rudnick <trudnick at itc.nrcs.usda.gov>
   and Anthony Pardini <tony at pardini.org> new function was added:
   cidrs2cidrs().  cidrs2cidrs will condense a set of netblocks by
   combining blocks together that make up larger blocks.
 - Anthony Pardini <tony at pardini.org>, Frank Tegtmeyer <fte @ fte.to>
   and George Walker <gwalker at irish-times.com> pointed me to a bug
   with the contains() method.  Fixed.

1.9007 2004-01-01

 - At Max Baker <max at warped.org>'s request, the "require 5.6.1" 
   was removed for better compatability with older perl versions.

1.9006 2003-12-05

 - Removed '@'s from this file.

1.9005 2003-11-29

 - Matija Papec <matija at post.hinet.hr> suggested that I do a
   Schwartzian transform on the IP address sort function.  I 
   tried it.  It's faster.  Sort function replaced.

 - Added a sort_network_blocks function.
 - Added a contains() function to test if one block fits within
   another.
 - Peter Chen <petechen at netilla.com> was concerned about 
   using an illegal bitmask.  Now checked.
 - Long ago, Alexandros M Manoussakis <amm2 at ini.cmu.edu> noted that
   could be exported even though it was in EXPORT_OK.  Fixed.

1.9004 2003-05-28

 - Martin Lorensen <martin at lorensen.dk>: make 'any' a synonym for
   'default'.  
 - Bugfix (aslo from Martin): fix the require to accept 5.6.1

1.9003 2003-05-26

 - Roman Shishkin <roman at rt.mipt.ru> provided several (public exported)
   functions for looking at network tables:
   	dumpNetworkTable()
   	checkNetblock()
   Inspired: changing findOuterNetblock() so it can take a block
   as it's IP address.
 - Bugfix: notice that '218.0.0.0 - 221.255.255.255' isn't a valid
   netmask.  Reported by Dan Wright <wright at smx.pair.com>.
 - Bugfix: could not specify network '0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255'.  Fix
   from Dominic Mitchell <dom at semantico.com>.
 - Added ->sameblock() from Martin Lorensen <martin at lorensen.dk>
 - Added ->cmpblocks().
 - Added overloaded stringification so that blocks stringify to their
   description.
 - Added overloaded block comparision so that blocks can be compared and
   sorted.
 - Added hostmask syntax a.b.c.d#hostmask - Martin Lorensen <martin at lorensen.dk>
 - Bugfix: t/badnets.t was missing from the MANIFEST.
 - Some spelling and typo mistakes fixed in the documentation.

1.9002 2001-11-12

 - Change the license to make the Debian folks happy.  Interface through
   Jonas Smedegaard <dr at jones.dk>.

1.9001 2001-09-29

 - Sapient Fridge <sapient.fridge at WaCkY.zzn.com> and Alexander Karptsov
   <karp at visti.net> sent a patch for a bug in range2cidrlist.  The
   last IP in the range was skipped.
 - Sam Denton <sdenton at wantec.com> requested support for 
   a.b.c.d/mask.mask.mask.mask.
 - Sam also sent a request that I include the world's fastest
   sort-by-ip-address-in-perl function in Net::Netmask as there didn't
   seem to be a better place to put it.  I've included it.  The function
   in question was found/benchmarked by John Porter and written about
   in the Perl-Users Digest, Issue 3860, Volume 8.
 - Sam sent a patch to eliminate a couple of trailing spaces in
   the error codes.
 - My IP address are now 216.240.32/19 instead of 140.174.82/19 and
   thus I've changed the examples in the pod.  :-)

1.9 2001-05-15

 - Added deleteNetblock to match storeNetblock.
 - Carol Lerche <cafl at securify.com> contributed findOuterNetblock()
   and findAllNetblocks().
 - Kevin Baker <kevin at apnic.net> sent in patches that suggested a new
   handling of error conditions; extra error conditions to test for; and
   a test script to exercise the error conditions.
 - Bruce Peikon <Bruce.Peikon at msdw.com> sent a contribution which suggested
   that enumerate could do so by network.
 - Dominic Mitchell <dom at semantico.com> sent in code that suggested the 
   creation of cidrs2contiglists() and range2cidrlist().
 - A couple of documentation fixes from Igor Vinokurov <igor at rtsnet.ru>.

1.8 1999-09-20

 - Modified the match() method to return the position within the block.

1.7 1999-09-15

 - Added support for understanding network blocks in the form that the
   whois database uses: FirstIP-LastIP.

1.6 1999-03-27

 - Jochen Wiedmann <joe at ispsoft.de> contributed a function to test an IP
   address and a block to test see if the IP address is in the block. 
   Accordingly, there is now a match() method.
 - Rob Walker <rob at varesearch.com> contributed a function to return the
   first usable adress in a block.  Instead of using that, I added a function
   to return the nth address in a block.  There is now an nth() function.

1.4 1998-11-29

 - Jean-Luc Szpyrka <Jean-Luc.Szpyrka at sophia.inria.fr> requested that a
   function be provided that returns the oposite of a netmask.  Accordingly,
   there is now the hostmask() method.
