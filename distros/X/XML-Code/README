XML::Code - Perl module for converting XML hash structures into plain text.

/*
   Description
*/

XML::Code module is designed to enable simple object-oriented procedure of creating XML data.
As soon as a programmer realizes that XML and OOP are kindred and have sibling connections 
he or she wants to use objects instead of plain text in the phase of producing XML files.
XML::Code allows thinking of XML tags as of nested named objects and expects XML::Code::code()
method be called to produce plain text XML.

XML::Code only produce code: that means the module does not provide methods of random access
(like XPath does) to the XML structure though tree elements are fully accessible as nested hashes.
