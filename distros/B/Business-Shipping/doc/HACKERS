Intended audience: developers who wish to modify Business::Shipping.

Patches are welcome. Style and guidlines are enfoced with Perl::Critic, with one
caveat: string eval in a few modules to allow for runtime loading of shipper 
modules (excluded in t/perlcriticrc). PerlTidy is used:

 find .  -name '*.t'  \
     -or -name '*.pm' \
     -or -name '*.PL' \
     -exec perltidy -pbp -b -nst -nse -pt=2 -sbt=2 {} \;

Devel::Cover shows very little test coverage. That is a goal for improvement.

 cover -test

Some of the code is for backwards-compatibility only.

The reason that the version is specified the same in every module is only to 
help in those rare circumstances where partial module installations exist in 
@INC so that old versions are mixed with new versions, as described here:
