					TXT	"some string  1.2.3.4"
						 ^this was corrupted^

	add an rbldns default record to the comment header of the zonefile
	of the form:

		; rbldnsDEF:a:txt

0.40  Sun Apr 17 02:13:38 PDT 2005
	add -C continuity flag, default '0', this is a BEHAVIOR CHANGE
	For very large zones and multiple daemons constantly adding
	and removing records, it is very difficult to get a contiguous
	zone dump where the starting and ending serial number is constant.
	Instead, re-sync the cursor to ignore BerkeleyDB's behavior of
	renumbering the records after an insert or delete. This allows
	a zone dump to proceed when record values that have already
	been read are deleted or inserts are made to the area the cursor
	has already transversed. More specifically, records ahead of the 
	cursor will appear in the zone file as they are transversed, records
	altered behind the cursor are not seen so effectively the zone is
	frozen for dump purposes at the instant the cursor transverse it.
	With "Continuity" set true, a single unperterbed snapshot of the
	database is dumped to the zone file. However, this method will fail
	if records are added or removed during the dump. The dump will
	automatically retry 3 times. The practical aspect of this change
	is that it is as if the zone was read a minute or two earlier in
	the case of similtaneous database updates.

	The old -C behavior is not desirable for large zones because it is not
	practical for the database to remain static long enough for a 
	complete zone dump. The behavior is deprecated, the -C flag is
	provided to retain the old behavior if for some strange reason
	you find it desirable.
	
	Removed redundant tests for 127.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1
	in ns.c and zonefile.c

	corrected and old bug in zonefile.c that dumped 127.0.0.1
	records to the zonefile

0.39  Fri Apr 15 15:57:36 PDT 2005
	left pointer indicator '&' out of statement and 
	inadvertently commented out -L switch code in 0.38 release
	duh!!!

0.38  Thu Apr 14 13:02:58 PDT 2005
	add -L switch to limit the zonefile build transfer rate
	during a dnsbls zone dump. default 200,000 chars/sec

0.37  Tue Mar  1 10:40:10 PST 2005
	modify ns.c to always hide 127.0.0.0 AND 127.0.0.1 responses

0.36  Tue Jan 11 15:45:02 PST 2005
	change query response for record not found 
		from:	NOERROR + SOA
		to:	NXDOMAIN + SOA
	to conform to standard response of most other d
  Thanks to csg@habeas.com for spotting the error.

0.35  Sat Dec  4 14:06:58 PST 2004
	adjust priority of zonefile child to use minimum cpu cycles,
	this needs site dependent "setpriority", tested with siteconf

0.34  Sun Nov 14 21:39:48 PST 2004
	add the number of records dumped by zonfile.c comment 
	text in the zonefile. the form of the zonfile header is:

	; Version: dnsbls 0.34, 11-14-04
	; 375624 A records
	; zone dump on Sun Nov 14 22:05:52 2004


0.33  Sat Nov 13 16:31:56 PST 2004
	update docs

0.32  Wed Oct  6 11:08:38 PDT 2004
	update docs

0.31  Sat Oct  2 13:46:36 PDT 2004
	correct BUG in zonefile.c that did not propagate IP address to
	the TXT record while dumping a zone file

	data.c, minor document update

0.30  Fri Aug 27 10:08:51 PDT 2004
	update CTest.xs to eliminate use of "putchar" which conflicts
	with buffered/unbuffered use of IO in testing

0.29  Sun Jun 27 09:04:56 PDT 2004
	Added 'stop' variable for testing in main.c to intercept
	processing of the -T flag and stop STDOUT
	# Something in perl 5.8 does not allow the redirection of
	# STDOUT in an eval to a C program. The workaround is
	# simply to abort the call to 'main' just prior to issuing
	# the print statements since this is all tested elsewhere
	#

0.28  Sat Jun 26 16:22:40 PDT 2004
	added time tag to zone file dump in dnsbls::zonefile.c

	changed test for zone dump so that it just checks for the
	presence of a "zone_request" instead of no other activity + zone_request

	fixed comment type in util_pid.c

0.27  Fri Jun 25 11:25:29 PDT 2004
	changed zonefile.c 'version' reporting string for zone file dump

0.26  Wed Jun 23 12:55:01 PDT 2004
	fixed bug in ns.c that prevented 127.xx.xx.xx response TXT strings
	inserted by rc.dnsbls from being reported

	added zonefile.c and zonedump.c so that dnsbls can
	dump a zonefile to the dbhome directory on receipt
	of a SIG_USR2

	add script 'sc_zoneload' to load a BIND or 'dig' zone file
	into the database.

0.25  Tue Jun  8 16:29:39 PDT 2004
	updated rc.dnsbls v0.10 to fix bug for perl v5.8.3 
	where unshift does not work properly for default @_

0.24  Mon May 10 18:39:31 PDT 2004
	modified rc.dnsbls so that tarpit records forceably added from the
	config file (such at 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3, etc...) are tested first
	for existence and NOT added if they already exist. This preserves
	the data (time tag) on these records so that they can be used by
	other routines -- noteably, 127.0.0.2 which should always be present
	is used by sc_BLpreen.pl to determine it's own cron interval

0.23  Sat May  1 16:02:23 PDT 2004
	altered the comments at the beginning of DNSBLserver.pm

0.22  Mon Feb  9 15:56:51 PST 2004
	rewrite 'restart' logic in rc.dnsbls v0.8

0.21  Thu Oct 16 13:22:15 PDT 2003
	correct logic in ns.c to report 127.x.x.x codes in zone transfers

	add logic to main.c and ns.c to append the text of the IP address
	to standard TXT responses if the error message is default and 
	contains the character ? as in http://xxx.com?abc=

0.20  Sat Oct 11 08:28:02 PDT 2003
	modify util_pid.c and misc.c to include unlinkOK as in BDBaccess.
	update options.t to test correctly when default /var/run/dbtarpit 
	directory is not present

0.19  Wed Oct  8 11:36:59 PDT 2003
	add makefile entry to copy rc.dnsbls to install script file directory
	update test suites to accomodate libdbtarpit changes

0.18  Fri Oct  3 15:54:00 PDT 2003
	add code to generate child pid files and 
	for each task to remove it's own pid file on exit

0.17  Thu Sep 25 11:02:02 PDT 2003
	add Makefile constant MY_POD2TEXT

0.16  Wed Sep 24 14:08:42 PDT 2003
	modify source to be 32/64 bit independent
	modify ns.t to ignore poor implementations of dn_comp
	add os independent library calls/macros

0.15  Sat Sep 20 11:44:11 PDT 2003
	Add child wait status to tcp service so that the connection remains
	open until closed by the client or an alarm event.
	Add minimal IXFR service.

0.14  Thu Sep 18 15:13:15 PDT 2003
	place - holder

0.13  Thu Sep 18 15:13:15 PDT 2003
	incremental changes - place holder

0.12  Sun Sep 14 09:40:23 PDT 2003
	ns.c, rework the order of database interrogation for lookups
	of black list addresses. The old way produced three database hits 
	as the norm, this has been reduced to two.

0.11  Tue Sep  9 18:00:28 PDT 2003
	main.c -- modified the child network socket loop to fix a timing 
	problem when interrogating the dnsbls from the local host via bind.

	modify rc.dnsbls so that record 127.0.0.2 is 
	forceably added without user intervention.

0.10  Tue Sep  2 21:04:13 PDT 2003
	Revert -M option -- this turns out to be unneeded
	Add -N option for naming the localhost DNS object
	Correct error in mungemacros.c where buffer size constraint
	was MSGsize instead of IP_MAXPACKET
	Add lookup in the evidence file to ns.c. Evidence must be
	consulted before blcontrib to prevent non-reporting of 
	127.0.0.2 'A' records if they appear in both blcontrib and evidence.

0.09  Mon Sep  1 15:32:36 PDT 2003
	Add -M masquerade option to main.c, host_info.c
	When dnsbl is run on a virtual address, it must use the
	zone name and designated IP address from the command line

0.08  Tue Aug 12 15:53:46 PDT 2003
	Modify ns.c to disallow response codes outside
	the range of 127.0.0.3 => 127.255.255.255 for
	the blcontrib database. This will prevent
	feedback loops from developing among cooperating
	promiscious DNSBL servers

0.07  Sat Aug  2 22:25:05 PDT 2003
	set -P option for promiscious reporting

0.06  Wed Jul 30 09:59:09 PDT 2003
	change conflicting name Config.pm to SiteConfig.pm

0.05  Sat Jul 23 13:53:44 PDT 2003

	update to use bdbtarpit.c library

0.03  Thu Jul 10 07:37:26 PDT 2003

	enable reporting of tarpit
	additions by secondary DNSBL's

0.02  Sun Jul  6 17:00:06 PDT 2003
	correct malformed TXT records,
	add statistics for verbose logging,
	fix SIGCHLD bug in set_signals

0.01  Sat Jul  5 14:48:50 PDT 2003
	alpha release
