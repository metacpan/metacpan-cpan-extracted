Revision history for Perl extension GD::SecurityImage.

Time zone is GMT+2.

1.73 Wed Jan 21 01:36:45 2015
    => RT#87918.

1.72 Sun Jul  8 01:50:04 2012
    => Bump version.

1.71 Sun Sep  4 00:58:52 2011
    => Major Perl::Critic refactoring.
    => Pod fix by Gregor Herrmann.

1.70 Thu Apr 30 16:56:32 2009
    => Made a mistake. version checking test is really gone now.

1.69 Thu Apr 30 15:13:19 2009
    => Re-release without the version check test.

1.68 Wed Apr 22 19:49:46 2009
    => Update builder.

1.67 Sat Apr 18 05:45:48 2009
    => Update distro files.

1.66 Sun Jun  8 17:03:24 2008
    => Fix for RT#35115.

1.65 Wed Feb 27 21:47:38 2008
    => Fix for RT#33629.
    => All files unixified (LF).

1.64 Wed Apr 25 21:01:49 2007
    => Yet another test suite update for Image::Magick.
    => New style "blank" added for evil purposes.
    => Fixed a regex in demo.pl

1.63 Sat Feb 24 16:41:03 2007
    => I didn't check the existence of Image::Magick in 
       06-version_magick.t and this resulted with FAILs.
       Fixed this and updated all magick tests. They now
       show the real number of skipped tests (if they are skipped)

1.62 Fri Feb 23 23:13:37 2007
    => Minor fixes in Pods. Added an image samples section
       (as HTML) and CPAN modules that are using GD::SecurityImage.
       Also added a SUPPORT section.
    => Updated demo.pl. Added "program" config option.
    => Refactored and cleaned up some parts and demo.
       Most parts are "Damianized".
    => New private methods _versionlt() and _versiongt()
       for backend version comparison. _versiongt()
       actually means: "greater than or equal to".
    => Updated tests.
    => Optimized styles.

1.61 Thu May 25 21:56:44 2006
    => Renamed constants in GD::SecurityImage::GD:
          _X_ is now CH_X
          _Y_ is now CH_Y
       There is a bug in the constant pragma that is bundled 
       with legacy perl ($] < 5.006). In these perls,
       the code was dying with this message:
       Can't define "_X_" as constant (name contains invalid 
       characters or is empty).

1.60 Sun Feb 19 23:33:36 2006
    => Removed GD::SecurityImage::AC to it's own distribution
       because of the increasing interest.

1.59 Fri Jan  6 13:56:41 2006
    => Updated ::AC. Module. It now dies if gdbox_empty().
       If libgd is compiled without TTF support, we'll get
       an empty image. Also added this to Pod.
    => Removed SIGNATURE file and signature test and anything
       Module::Signature related per RT #15346. I'm tired of
       Module::Signature.

1.583 Fri Nov 25 23:06:36 2005
    => Another relase for distro/sig issues. Now all files are CRLF
       and signature testing is disabled if !MSWin32. 
       Module::Signature currently (<= 0.50) can not validate CRLF
       files if it is working under some non-Windows OS. I'm waiting
       for a response from Module::Signature author on this subject.
    => Renamed some tests.
    => Updated pod.

1.582 Sat Oct 29 20:43:04 2005
    => Updated test suite to increase kwalitee :)

1.581 Wed Oct 26 20:21:09 2005
    => Fixed Makefile.PL. Build.PL was causing this error:
       "Too early to specify a build action 'Build'.  Do 'Build Build' instead."
       Setting "PL_FILES" to an empty hashref solves the problem.
       This was mentioned in Module::Build::Compat, but I' ve
       missed it and this error does not seem to happen under 
       Windows or with the latest version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker,
       I'm not sure which one is the case.

1.58 Wed Oct 26 13:28:35 2005
    => Fixed a gdbox issue in ::GD backend.
    => Pod fixes.

1.57_02 Fri Oct 21 19:46:11 2005
    => Reworked an undocumented method. New name is info_text().
       You can now add information strips to the generated image.
       The demo already uses this undocumented feature for a while.
       This method can be used to add copyright information. Some 
       free captcha services are doing that. Alternatively, you can
       display the image generation time like the demo does.
    => Added info_text() info to pod and fixed the other pod sections.
    => Updated test suite.

1.57_01 Wed Oct 19 14:31:22 2005
    => Converted to Module::Build from ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    => Nothing changed in modules. Just a test for PAUSE indexer
       and Module::Build.

1.57 Tue Oct  4 18:24:12 2005
    => Fixed typos in pods.
    => Added RT Wishlist item #14618. 'angle' parameter is now
       used when scramble is not enabled. But this'll require 
       a taller image, since the random code is centered
       inside the image. Added info about this into the pod.
    => Updated demo.

1.56 Sat Oct  1 14:14:34 2005
    => Added GD::SecurityImage backend => 'AC';
    => Updated demo Pod.
    => Added some tips to the pod.
    => Updated licenses.
    => Updated Makefile.PL. Removed Math::Trig from prerequisities,
       since it is in CORE since perl 5.004.
    => GD::SecurityImage::AC is now untainted (I hope).
       Reported by Michael B Krypel. Still no tests for this
       module.
    => Existence of setThickness() is now explicitly checked for
       GD < 2.07.

1.55 Wed Apr 13 17:58:37 2005
    => New sub-module GD::SecurityImage::AC added as an
       Authen::Captcha drop-in replacement module.
       I currently didn't add any tests for this module.
    => New method 'backends' to list available back-ends.

1.54 Fri Apr  8 23:11:32 2005
    => Updated pods.
    => If anyone adds a back-end, one must define a method
       to deal with colors: 'backend_cconvert'. cconvert()
       will forward all calls to backend_cconvert() if 
       $BACKEND is different than /^(GD|Magick)$/. Note that
       this method must be capable of handling both HEX and RGB.
    => Finally documented this. See BACKEND_AUTHORS section in
       the pod (If you have a HTML version, probably you can not
       see this).
    => Removed gdbox_empty from GD::SecurityImage::Magick
    => The module now has an AUTOLOAD method.
    => Added a check for gdbox_empty in AUTOLOAD for non-GD 
       backends.
    => Ooops! ellipse() added in GD 2.07 :p Thanks to ActiveState
       build logs. I missed that one (looks like all CPAN Testers 
       are using recent GDs).
       Added a global mechanism to check this and any incompatibilities.
       If GD < 2.07 and you call ellipse() it will fall-back to default()
       style. If you call ec() style, it'll disable ellipse() call and only
       draw circles.
    => Updated GD::SecurityImage::Styles.
    => Updated demo program. Also, changed default type to 'png' after 
       a little conversation with Eric Gorr. :) (some installations may 
       have gif() method but don't have gif support enabled. This results
       with an empty image. Cause: old libgd).
    => Default image type in GD::SecurityImage::GD::out() changed to 'png'.

1.53 Wed Jan  5 18:21:59 2005
    => Added a new option 'backend' to import(). With this
       option you can now include other back-ends:

           use GD::SecurityImage backend => 'Magick';

       will load the GD::SecurityImage::Magick for example.
       If you wrote a backend for GD::SecurityImage, you can 
       now combine your back-end with GD::SecurityImage. Like, 
       if you created a Imager back-end named 'GD::SecurityImage::Imager',
       you can load it like this:

           use GD::SecurityImage backend => 'Imager';

       No one requested this kind of functionality (yet), but I'm 
       adding it anyway. And *NO* I will not create an Imager or 
       any other backend myself (at least not in the near future). 
       I' m already supporting two different interfaces.

       Probably cconvert() also needs a fix to support such a thing.
       I'll deal with that later.
    => If you have loaded Image::Magick outside and then you call 
       GD::SecurityImage with the GD backend (or simply use it)
       your code dies with a weird error. Since it setups the 
       interface for Image::Magick, but you didn't select Image::Magick 
       as the backend. For example, this simple code dies if you are using
       1.52 and below:

           use Image::Magick;
           use GD::SecurityImage;
           GD::SecurityImage->new->create;

       This bug cought by Dave Rolsky.
    => New class variable $BACKEND added to deal with this bug.
       The backend is now completely checked and set in import().
    => Also, the module is now checking whether you called import()
       or not. If you didn't, it'll die (it actually checks if $BACKEND
       has a value).
    => Added a new test 'backend.t' to check these.

1.52 Tue Dec 21 15:07:37 2004
    => After implementing HEX colors with cconvert, I forgot to 
       set default colors in create() which will throw an exception
       without the default color values. 
       Reported by Billy Vierra.
    => Updated pod.

1.51 Sun Dec 19 00:02:13 2004
    => Updated demo program code.
    => Updated Makefile.PL.
    => New private method cconvert for transparent GD/Image::Magick 
       color conversion.
    => Removed GD::SecurityImage::Magick::rgbx().
    => The module now supports hex color codes like "#ffffff".
    => Updated pod.

    => [NOT DOCUMENTED] New private method add_strip.
    => [NOT DOCUMENTED] New method set_tl.
    => [NOT DOCUMENTED] New method change_random.
    => [NOT DOCUMENTED] New parameter 'text_location' added to new.
    => [NOT DOCUMENTED] With text_location option, you can now add info boxes to 
       the 4 corners of the image (or you can use this for something else).
    => [NOT DOCUMENTED] Behavior of out() changed. If set_tl is used and
       you change the random code (text option) several times, it may 
       be an array.

1.5 Sat Oct 30 17:11:53 2004
    => Fixed pod.
    => Minor fixes.
    => rndmax option to new, now controls the minimum random character
       length, when you supply your own random string.
    => Updated tests.
    => Added a demo program to "eg/demo.pl".
       It needs DBI, DBD::mysql (and a MySQL server), Apache::Session, 
       String::Random and some CORE modules to run.
    => GD still needs an absolute path. Fixed pod.

1.4_03 Mon Oct 11 21:55:37 2004
    => Older GDs do not have setThickness. 
       "setThickness" added in "GD 2.07 @ 24 Apr 2003". 
       Fixed thickness option in new. 
       Updated test api for this.
       Added this to Pod.
    => Added "compress" argument to out() for "jpeg" and "png". 
    => But GD *again* has a problem here. Compression argument for 
       png is implemented in "GD 2.07". out() silently ignores 
       compression parameter, if you have an older GD and set output 
       format to png.
       Added this to Pod.
    => Also, jpeg method and quality level for jpeg added 
       in "GD 1.26 @ 18 Mar 2000". But currently, I didn't add 
       any controls to detect that and I don't know who can 
       use that pre-historic versions (other than sf.net!).
    => It's too hard to stay compatible with older versions!

1.4_02 Sat Oct  9 14:48:18 2004
    => Fixed a bug in new for the angle parameter.
    => New private method setThickness.
    => New option 'thickness' added to new.
    => Replaced buggy/silly "_charw" with "ttf_info" in GD backend. 
       Hopefully, this fixes the "scramble" implementation for GD.
    => Updated test suite. Now, there is a single test api and two
       test files.
    => Changed Makefile.PL. "GD" is now hardcoded as a prerequisite.
       Removed user input codes. The presence of "Image::Magick"
       is now tested inside the test file and magick test will
       be skipped if there is no "Image::Magick" 
       (request from Barbie -- not exactly this, but similar).

1.4_01 Mon Sep 20 16:46:13 2004
    => It looks like newer versions of GD does not have the path 
       bug, but I do not know the exact version that this was 
       fixed. Anyway, it looks like v2.16 does not have that bug. 
       Also added this to Pod.
    => The module now automatically drops to 'normal' mode if
       you are using GD and your GD version is smaller than 1.20
       and you have selected 'ttf' method.
       Q: Why?
       A: v1.19 and below does not have ttf support. (As mentioned
          in earlier releases) -- also: sf.net has GD v1.19 :).
       Module does this silently, so you'll not get any warnings about
       that.
    => New parameters scramble and angle added to new(). If you enable 
       scramble, you have to generate a bigger image, since characters 
       have three spaces between them.
    => I've decided to change the description of the module. Now it
       has the word "captcha" in it (for search engines).
    => Added some new constants to both backends.
    => Module now requires Math::Trig (which is a CORE module) for 
       degree to radian calculation.
    => New tests for scramble.
    => New private method random_angle.

1.33 Sun Aug 22 16:50:42 2004
    => Because of libgd's path bug, in some cases,
       GD::SecurityImage::GD::insert_text() can not get the 
       boundary list. I've added a workaround there. If we don't 
       get the list, then we'll use width/2 and height/2 which 
       will generate wrong values (since the image will not
       include any string and because the underlying library can not 
       find the ttf font, that's not the problem), but I can not do 
       anything about it.
       GD wants an *exact* path with no spaces in it for TTF Fonts.
       Just don't put your codes/fonts in paths that have spaces in it.
       And don't try to "make test" from a location like this.
       You can blame windowz and/or libgd for this.
       Also, if Cwd::getcwd() can not get the exact path, we will have
       the same problem, but after this version, you'll probably not 
       get "Use of uninitialized value" warnings.
    => New method gdbox_empty() added to GD::SecurityImage::GD.
       Also added a fake gdbox_empty() method to 
       GD::SecurityImage::Magick for compatibility.
       Under GD::SecurityImage::Magick, this method always returns 
       false.
    => Minor fix in create().
    => Updated Pods. Sub modules have definiton of what they are now.

1.321 Wed Jul 28 21:52:04 2004
    => Updated tests. Code didn't change.

1.32 Wed Jul 28 15:49:12 2004
    => Minimal fix in create().
    => There is a bug in PerlMagicks older than 6.0.4.
       From <http://www.imagemagick.org/www/Changelog.html>:
       "PerlMagick's QueryFontMetrics() incorrectly reports 
       `unrecognized attribute'` for the `font' attribute".
       Image::Magick test is now skipped if your 
       $Image::Magick::VERSION is smaller than 6.0.4.
       Please upgrade to 6.0.4, if you want to use Image::Magick
       as the backend.
    => Added this bug to Pod.

1.31 Sun Jun 27 00:08:49 2004
    => Updated Pod.
    => send_ctobg is disabled automatically if style is 
       set to 'box'.
    => All styles can put a frame around the image now.
       And this feature is enabled by default.
    => New option 'frame' added to new().
    => Renamed constants in GD::SecurityImage::GD.
    => Changed tests.

1.3 Mon Jun 21 19:11:13 2004
    => New method particle().
    => Private method r2h().
    => Fixed color conversion for Image::Magick.
    => out() now accepts arguments.
    => Updated pod.

1.2 Fri Jun 18 21:39:08 2004
    => Added raw() method.
    => Fixed gd_font object key.
    => new style "ec".
    => Adapted Image::Magick compatibility (request from Mark Fuller).
       I may add Image::Magick spesific styles in future releases.
    => New modules added: 
          GD::SecurityImage::GD
          GD::SecurityImage::Magick
          GD::SecurityImage::Styles
       and GD::SecurityImage is smaller now ;)
    => Renamed old tests to (added 'gd_' to names):
          t/gd_01_use.t
          t/gd_02_normal.t
          t/gd_03_ttf.t
    => Added new tests:
          t/im_01_use.t
          t/im_02_ttf.t
    => Altered Makefile.PL and test files to skip tests if the user selects to do so.

1.1 Fri May 14 22:08:39 2004
    => Added 'send_ctobg' option to new().
    => After testing the code with a *really* old GD 
       (1.19 -- which has no ttf support), I've realized 
       that stringFT was implemented in GD 1.31. 
       So, the ttf test now has a skip option.
    => Also added stringTTF check for backward compatibility.
       stringTTF => (GD 1.20 @ 30 Aug 1999 )
       stringFT  => (GD 1.31 @ 26 Sep 2001 )
    => Fixed pod. There was an '=item' instead of '=head'.
    => Added new styles 'circle' and 'ellipse'.
    => Updated 03_ttf.t

1.0 Mon Apr 26 21:40:45 2004
    => First release.
