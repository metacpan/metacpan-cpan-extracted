0.015     2017-04-27 15:58:47Z
          - remove tracking of _share_dir_map -- it can be legitimately read
            in the filegathering phase

0.014     2016-02-16 03:10:21Z
          - also check for premature reading of _share_dir_map

0.013     2015-08-11 03:05:27Z
          - fix handling of skip_distmeta fields (i.e. special-casing of

0.012     2015-08-09 01:02:10Z
          - now also checking for prereqs provided with other metadata,
            and distribution metadata modified after being provided

0.011     2015-05-08 02:52:01Z
          - also test for premature population of release_status (a new
            attribute in Dist::Zilla 5.035)
          - drop requirement for List::MoreUtils

0.010     2015-01-11 07:40:28Z
          - fix incorrect warning messages when two files are added with the
            same filename

0.009     2014-11-16 04:02:48Z
          - bump required version of Term::ANSIColor for bright colours

0.008     2014-11-15 03:02:07Z
          - fix test failure with older Dist::Zilla and coloured log messages

0.007     2014-11-14 01:34:39Z
          - use colour in log messages for greater visibility

0.006     2014-11-06 04:35:42Z
          - now also checking for premature prereq calculation, given a new
            enough Dist::Zilla

0.005     2014-11-02 05:44:51Z
          - avoid reporting false positives for core zilla attributes that
            were set at construction time (via root config or stash)

0.004     2014-11-01 08:47:41Z
          - fix tests that fail with Dist::Zilla 5.023 (changes to added_by
            semantics)
          - also check the execution order of -NameProvider, -LicenseProvider
            plugins and access time of the abstract, main_module, authors and
            prereqs attributes

0.003     2014-04-06 20:38:06Z
          - also check that -VersionProvider plugins do not run too soon

0.002     2014-03-04 06:37:37Z
          - avoid warning about late modifications to Makefile.PL and
            Build.PL, as this is normal and expected
          - also identify the original filename of a file that has been
            renamed
          - additional checks for files removed outside the pruning phase or
            added after the file gathering phase
          - additional checks for files having their encodings changed outside
            of the file gathering or encoding provider phase
          - at the start of the build, adjust the plugin order so we always
            run last in each phase

0.001     2014-02-23 05:11:23Z
          - Initial release.
