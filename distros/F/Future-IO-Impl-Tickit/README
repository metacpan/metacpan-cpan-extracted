NAME

    Future::IO::Impl::Tickit - implement Future::IO with Tickit

SYNOPSIS

       use Future::IO;
       use Future::IO::Impl::Tickit;
    
       use Tickit;
    
       my $tickit = Tickit->new;
       Future::IO::Impl::Tickit->set_tickit( $tickit );
    
       ...

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an implementation for Future::IO which uses
    Tickit.

    Because this module will need a valid toplevel Tickit instance object
    in order to work, you will need to call the "set_tickit" method before
    any of the Future::IO interface will work.

METHODS

 set_tickit

       Future::IO::Impl::Tickit->set_tickit( $tickit );

    Sets the toplevel Tickit instance to use for the event watching used to
    implement this module.
