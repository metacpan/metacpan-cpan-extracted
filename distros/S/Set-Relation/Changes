                               Set::Relation
                                  Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-06-26

    * Set::Relation version 0.13.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.13.1.tar.gz.

    * The main purpose of this release is to excise Set::Relation's last
    runtime dependency on a non-Perl-core module, which is List::MoreUtils.
    As of this release, each of the 2 Set::Relation classes requires only
    the Perl core or core modules to run, and nothing else.  Or at least
    that is the case if that Perl is version 5.25.1 (5.26 when stable) or
    newer; otherwise, they also depend on just the 1 dual-life CPAN module
    List::Util version 1.45 or newer.  As of version 1.33 or Perl 5.20.0,
    List::Util provided 3 of the 4 List::MoreUtils functions we use ("any",
    "all", "notall"), and if it was just that, then Perl 5.20.0+ with no
    further CPAN modules would have sufficed.  However, List::Util didn't
    gain the 4th function we use ("uniqstr" nee "uniq") until version 1.45.

    * Updated all code files (3 lib/*.pm plus 3 t/*.t) with
    "use warnings FATAL => 'all';" to instead have "use warnings;".
    Starting with the 2015 release of Perl 5.22.0 it has been officially
    documented that using "FATAL => 'all'" is a bad practice especially
    in a CPAN module.  Since Set::Relation has no particularly strong
    reason to do this (it was just thought to be a good practice before),
    it no longer will.  See also for more context
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/lib/warnings.pm#Fatal_Warnings .

    * (V1.pm)  Added a documentation note under "DESCRIPTION" -> "Matters
    of Performance" that the independently developed design feature to use
    hashing for performance also had prior art, called a "hash join".

    * (README)  Indicate that this distribution now only has 1 public Git
    repository, on GitHub.com; the older one on utsl.gen.nz appears to have
    been retired.  Also indicate that the host domain pugscode.org of the
    Perl 6 Pugs project that bundled the Perl 6 version has since expired.
    Made a few other smaller documentation changes.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2016.

2015-01-01

    * Set::Relation version 0.13.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.13.0.tar.gz.

    * The main purpose of this release is making Set::Relation
    substantially lighter in its external dependencies, so that it can be
    installed and used with a relative minimum of overhead.  This release
    focuses on the low hanging fruit in that regard, namely the elimination
    of the Moose and namespace::autoclean dependencies, which are very
    large trees and didn't really bring much to the table.  As of this
    release, each of the 2 Set::Relation classes require only the Perl core
    or core modules to run, plus just the 1 CPAN module List::MoreUtils.
    If you already have List::MoreUtils installed, you can use either V1 or
    V2 as simply as copying the respective single file into a Perl lib dir.
    If there is a user desire, the used functionality of List::MoreUtils
    could be inlined as well, thus making Set::Relation only require core.

    * This distribution has excised its direct external dependencies on the
    modules Moose, Moose::Role, Class::MOP and namespace::autoclean.

    * Updated explicit dependencies on Perl core modules to reduce the
    required minimum version numbers to be the same as those bundled with
    Perl 5.8.1, the minimum declared Perl version.  If it turns out we
    actually need newer versions of any of these, they can be increased as
    needed.  Meanwhile, in practice users would have much newer versions
    anyway when their Perls are newer.  So minimum Carp is now 1.01
    (previously no explicit dependency), ExtUtils::MakeMaker is now 6.17
    (was 6.48), Scalar::Util is now 1.13 (was 1.21), Test::More is now 0.47
    (was 0.92).  Requiring newer versions than these would require CPAN
    installation or a newer Perl version.

    * Updated explicit dependencies on Perl modules that are not bundled
    with any version of Perl and must be installed from CPAN:  The minimum
    List::MoreUtils was raised to 0.28 as versions before 0.25_02 fail on
    Perl 5.10.1+.  The minimum Carp::Always (used only by the test suite)
    was reduced to 0.01, its first version; this can be raised later if it
    needs to be.  The minimum Test::Deep (used only by the test suite) was
    left unchanged at 0.106, as versions below (0.104) fail on Perl 5.10.1+.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Demoted the packages Set::Relation and
    Set::Relation::Mutable from being actual abstract roles to just being
    placeholder namespaces for the distribution or for documentation
    purposes.  Each of the 2 files V2.pm and V1.pm is now self-contained
    and no longer has a hard dependency on Relation.pm; the latter now just
    exists as common documentation, illustrating roles that the classes in
    the former conceptually must compose, where this is unenforced by code.
    As such, Relation.pm doesn't actually have to be installed.
    Related to this, V2 and V1 now each declare their own does() method,
    which hard-codes that they compose Set::Relation/::Mutable, in case one
    wants to use it like the one Moose had provided.
    Calling isa() on V2 or V1 will continue to work as it did before,
    including that it returns false for Set::Relation/::Mutable.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Relation.pm no longer uses Moose::Role
    and V2.pm plus V1.pm no longer use Moose; the latter 2 now explicitly
    use Carp::confess() and Scalar::Util::blessed() instead.  Now V2 and V1
    each have an explicitly defined new() submethod to replace what Moose
    had provided, and each also now has a complement of explicitly defined
    attribute private or public accessor methods, for the same reason.
    Other parts of those modules now test for "can('does')" rather than
    "isa('Moose::Object')" and besides this no other changes were needed
    for the code to work as it did in the previous release.

    * (Relation.pm, README, TODO)  Replaced any references in this distro
    to the obsolete Muldis Rosetta with its replacement Muldis::D::RefEng.
    Muldis::D::RefEng is still under development and has no CPAN release
    yet, which will be the case until it has a certain mainimum level of
    functionality; meanwhile, what has been written can be seen on GitHub.

    * Note that the changes of this release were partly inspired by Ralf
    Peine having just released the new module PQL::Cache, which has no
    non-Perl-core dependencies and can install with a simple file copy.
    (It was intended all along that my newer Muldis D implementations would
    similarly eschew non-Perl-core dependencies, particularly Moose et al,
    but what was new is I was inspired to change Set::Relation likewise.)

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2015.

2015-01-01

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.8 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.8.tar.gz.

    * The sole purpose of this release is to publish on CPAN the various
    minor updates made to Set::Relation up through the middle of 2011, but
    that any dependency version increases were excluded / reverted.

    * Note that if you are running Perl 5.10.1+ then your List::MoreUtils
    must be v0.25_02+ rather than the actual hard dependency of v0.22+.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the *.pm file that declares
    multiple Perl packages, so that now every single package separately
    declares its (identical) package $VERSION, rather than just the first
    package in the file declaring said, implicitly applied to the others.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Updated all 1 role and 2 classes that
    compose roles so that they
    now specify what version numbers of said roles they require.  Moose had
    added support for declaring/enforcing this in its v1.03 (2010-05-06).
    Note that Set::Relation's hard dependency on Moose has not been
    increased from v0.92+; it has not been tested if using a version before
    v1.03 will actually fail or not.

    * (Relation.pm, README)  Updated the list of email forums focusing on
    Muldis D and its implementations, first to add a 4th list
    muldis-d-language, and second to update all 4 lists' descriptions.
    (This change made near 2010-06-20.)

    * (Relation.pm, README, Makefile.PL)  Updated any instances of
    "http://mm.DarrenDuncan.net/mailman/listinfo" so that they are fully
    lower-cased, because the mixed case version doesn't work with some web
    browsers; browsers that don't automatically convert it to lowercase get
    a "There currently are no publically-advertised mailman lists" message.
    (This change made near 2010-05-17.)

    * (Relation.pm)  Now spell author personal name "Chris Date (C.J.
    Date)" rather than "Christopher J. Date".
    (This change made near 2010-10-08.)

    * (Relation.pm)  Following a Muldis D v0.110.0 spec change, updated the
    also-known-as notes for 5 functional methods.
    (This change made near 2010-03-01.)

    * (Relation.pm)  Following one or more Muldis D spec changes between
    v0.111.0 and v0.148.0 inclusive, updated the also-known-as notes for 11
    more functional methods, and possibly the same 5 as for v0.110.0.

    * There were also a few other minor documentation changes in the files.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2011.

2009-11-03

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.7 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.7.tar.gz.

    * (V1.pm)  Fixed two instances of a bug, one in the private method
    "_group" that manifests in all 4 public methods "[|cmpl_]group",
    "[|outer_]join_with_group", and one in the "summary" public method.
    There were no corresponding bugs in V2.pm.  Thanks to Todd Hepler for
    spotting the bug in "_group" and providing a patch.

    * (Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t)  Added another test
    block which exercises the "group" method, which previously had no
    tests; this test exposed the "_group" bug.  Thanks to Todd Hepler who
    authored and contributed the new tests.

    * Updated all author references to change Darren Duncan's stated email
    address from "perl@DarrenDuncan.net" to "darren@DarrenDuncan.net".

2009-10-29

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.6 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.6.tar.gz.

    * More small Makefile.PL enhancements.  Reverted part of the 0.12.5
    change, in that the Makefile.PL now starts with use 5.8 rather than 5.6
    but kept the 0.12.5 change in that warnings is still not fatal.  This
    was done since apparently there is no better way, under MakeMaker or
    otherwise, to be more graceful about required perl version than what
    results from the plain use-5.8 at the top of Makefile.PL.  As the
    0.12.5 Makefile.PL was, a Perl 5.6.2 was simply having errors at the
    "make test" stage due to that requiring 5.8, rather than at the
    Makefile.PL stage where it should have.  Also in Makefile.PL, updated
    the 'requires' item 'perl' to use X.00Y00Z format rather than X.Y.Z
    since the upcoming META.yml spec would be stricter about the format.

2009-10-26

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.5 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.5.tar.gz.

    * Updated the distro's Makefile.PL so it will now run under older Perls
    than the distro's payload modules would, so that users are informed
    more gracefully about their need to upgrade.  Rather than having the
    same boilerplate use 5.8/utf8/strict/warningsFatal as the modules, the
    Makefile.PL now has a more liberal 5.6/strict/warnings.  Also added
    explicit 'perl' requires-item to force mentioning of the Perl version
    in the generated META.yml, since MIN_PERL_VERSION doesn't cause this.

2009-10-26

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.4 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.4.tar.gz.

    * Oops, the previous release 0.12.3 shipped with code all declared as
    version 0.012002 rather than 0.012003; the metadata was correct though.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that this distribution now has 2
    public Git repositories, one on GitHub.com and one on utsl.gen.nz.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.92, Class::MOP
    to version 0.94.

    * (Relation.pm)  Fixed a doc typo; the wrong param was referenced.

    * (Relation.pm)  Following a Muldis D v0.95.0 spec change, updated the
    also-known-as notes for 2 functional methods.

    * Updated the README file to mention the new Muldis-D-Manual distro.

    * (Makefile.PL, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Added explicit dependency on
    Scalar::Util in both the Makefile.PL and in the "DEPENDENCIES" pod,
    because it is a best practice to name all direct dependencies
    regardless of whether any of them are normally bundled with Perl.

    * Major update to the Makefile.PL (and META.yml) to make its format
    more modern, in particular by distinguishing between dependencies that
    are needed to use the Set::Relation modules and those needed only for
    testing them or for configuring the distribution; previously, the
    dependencies needed only for testing were treated as if necessary to
    use Set::Relation itself; also added a list of "resources" urls.

2009-09-15

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.3 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.3.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: namespace::autoclean to version 0.09,
    Moose/etc to version 0.90, Class::MOP to version 0.93.

    * (V2.pm, V1.pm)  Internals update to remain compatible with the latest
    Moose/Class::MOP, which has deprecated the ability for one to say
    "$obj->new(...)", which we had been doing internally rather than
    "ClassName->new(...)" so that we still work when we're subclassed; so
    now we use "(blessed $obj)->new(...)" to make new objects instead.

    * (Relation.pm)  In accordance with the Muldis D spec v0.87.0+, updated
    the descriptions of the 10 functional methods that do
    rename/projection/wrap/group/etc to update notes about alternate names
    that each function or its operation are known as.

2009-08-29

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.2.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependency on Test::More to version 0.92, which is
    the version bundled with Perl 5.10.1.

    * Updated external dependency on Test::Deep to version 0.106, which
    currently is only used by the 1 test file
    Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t, because earlier versions
    of Test::Deep (0.104) fail their tests under Perl 5.10.1.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.89, Class::MOP
    to version 0.92.

    * (Relation.pm)  Other minor docs updates.

2009-08-08

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.1.tar.gz.

    * This distribution has excised its direct external dependency on the
    "version" module (bundled with Perl versions 5.10.0+), which was used
    in all .pm files and a .t file.  And so, the modules in this
    distribution now declare floating point version numbers of format
    X.00Y00Z in their code (0.012001 for example); however, all module
    documentation, and the distribution itself, still uses 3-part version
    numbers of format X.Y.Z (0.12.1 for example) as before.  The main
    reason for this change is to gain simplicity and reduce possible bugs.

2009-08-03

    * Set::Relation version 0.12.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.12.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.88, Class::MOP
    to version 0.91.

    * This release features a number of functional method updates in
    accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.82.0).

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:  Updated
    each of the 3 public functional methods "[|cmpl_]wrap", "unwrap" to
    swap the canonical order of its 2 "outer", "[|cmpl_]inner" parameters
    so that the one applying to the method's result appears first / on the
    left. Likewise with each of the 5 public functional methods
    "[|cmpl_|un|[cardinality|count]_per_]group" and its 2
    "[outer|count_attr_name]", "[inner|group_per]" parameters.  Also
    updated the 1 "rename" public functional method's "map" parameter to
    swap the Hash keys and values so that the Hash keys now represent the
    "new" names and the Hash values now represent the "old" names.

    * (Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t)  Updated the tests of
    the "rename" method to conform to its updated API.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the descriptions of 10 functional methods to
    add notes about alternate names that the function or its operation are
    known as.  The alternate names are symbolic and use combinations of
    these: '{', '}', '<-', '@'.  Used for rename/projection/wrap/group/etc.

2009-07-21

    * Set::Relation version 0.11.3 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.11.3.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependency on Test::More to version 0.88, which
    currently is only used by the 3 test files, same as what used previous
    versions.  While earlier versions of Test::More are bundled with Perl
    5, only the impending Perl 5.10.1 will bundle a version not earlier
    than 0.88, so meanwhile you must update Test::More from CPAN.  The test
    files were updated to no longer declare a planned number of tests at
    the start, but instead to declare "done_testing()" at the finish.  This
    change should help make further simultaneous development and merging by
    multiple developers less error prone.

2009-07-08

    * Set::Relation version 0.11.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.11.2.tar.gz.

    * As of this release, Set::Relation for Perl 5 uses the
    namespace::autoclean pragma instead of the namespace::clean pragma,
    because it is easier to use and not so contrived in how it works and is
    a generally recommended upgrade by savvy people.  Note that the newer
    dependency has a larger not-bundled dependency chain, including
    Class::MOP, but this isn't a problem because Set::Relation for Perl 5
    already uses Moose anyway.

    * This distribution has gained a new direct external dependency on the
    Carp::Always module, which currently is only used by the 3 test files.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.87, Class::MOP
    to version 0.89.

    * (Relation.pm)  Minor docs fix.

2009-06-08

    * Set::Relation version 0.11.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.11.1.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.81, Class::MOP
    to version 0.85.

    * (Relation.pm)  In accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.77.0),
    the Muldis D concept or type a Set::Relation object represents is now
    simply called "relation", which was renamed from "quasi-relation" in
    the spec.  Accordingly, removed the DESCRIPTION paragraph saying that a
    Set::Relation isn't quite a relational model relation; rather I am now
    claiming that it is exactly the same, though it is most like the less
    strict version where it is like every relation attribute may have a
    declared type of the universal set of values.  There are no actual code
    changes in the Set::Relation distro associated with this update.

2009-06-01

    * Set::Relation version 0.11.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.11.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.79, Class::MOP
    to version 0.84.

    * This release features a number of functional method updates or
    additions in accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.75.0).

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:  Updated
    each of the 2 "is[|_proper]_subset" public functional methods so that
    the canonical sequence of its invocant and parameter is reversed, so
    the method's name, used infix as normal for OO, would read correctly;
    also renamed said 2 inputs so that "look_for" is now "topic" and
    "look_in" is now "other".  This change is silently incompatible and old
    user code will continue to run without changes, but would give the
    wrong answers; any old code like "$foo->is_subset($bar)" will need to
    be changed to "$bar->is_subset($foo)" to keep its semantics, or
    alternately be changed to "$foo->is_superset($bar)" (see next chg itm).

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Added the 2 public functional methods
    (in the Set::Relation role) "is[|_proper]_superset", where each is an
    alias for another function, "is[|_proper]_subset", save that its
    invocant and argument are transposed.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Renamed the public functional method
    "is_member" to "has_member" so that the methods's name, used infix as
    normal for OO, reads correctly.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Renamed these 8 public functional
    methods to terser versions of themselves mainly for the purpose of
    making them easier to type: "cmpl_projection" -> "cmpl_proj",
    "transitive_closure" -> "tclose", "restriction_and_cmpl" ->
    "restr_and_cmpl", "cmpl_restriction" -> "cmpl_restr",
    "static_extension" -> "static_exten", "[|semi]difference" ->
    "[|semi]diff", "static_substitution" -> "static_subst".

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Added the 4 public functional methods
    (in the Set::Relation role) "count", "count_per_group",
    "symmetric_diff", "antijoin", where each is a simple alias for another
    functional method, "cardinality", "cardinality_per_group", "exclusion",
    "semidiff".

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Minor docs update to reflect that the
    Muldis D dialect HDMD_Perl5_Tiny was renamed to HDMD_Perl5_STD.

    * (Relation.pm)  Some POD reformatting:  Updated every method signature
    having a param "FooType $bar_param" with a linebreak between the paired
    type name and param name so that each pair is entirely on one line.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the docs for all 14 functional methods that
    have one or more parameters whose declared Perl 6 type was "Code", so
    that the more modern Perl 6 type name of "Callable" is used instead.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the docs on 3 functional methods to use more
    correct terminology with respect to symmetric dyadic functions, so that
    it now calls each a "symmetric function" rather than a "function with 2
    mutually commutative main parameters": "is_identical", "is_disjoint",
    "composition".

    * (Relation.pm)  Annotated the docs on 3 of the functional methods that
    previously were directly described with "commutative and associative"
    to now also say "idempotent" when the main inputs were supplied
    conceptually as a set argument and not a bag: "union", "intersection",
    "join".  Now "product" is also idempotent, but its description just
    says "like join".  The only N-adic functional method that isn't
    idempotent is "exclusion".

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the descriptions of 16 functional methods to
    add or update notes about alternate names that the function or its
    operation are known as, in particular adding the various math/etc
    symbols they represent.

2009-04-21

    * Set::Relation version 0.10.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.10.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: namespace::clean to version 0.11,
    Moose/etc to version 0.75, Class::MOP to version 0.82.

    * This release features a number of functional method updates or
    additions in accordance with the latest Muldis D spec (v0.64.0).

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Added, to the Set::Relation role and its
    composing classes, 2 new functional methods
    "[rank|limit]_by_attr_names", which are like "rank|limit" but that
    rather than taking a closure function to determine relative ordering of
    each pair of tuples, it takes an array of attribute names to order by;
    the new methods are more specialized versions of the old ones, and are
    recommended for use where they are applicable.  It is significant to
    note that these are the first Set::Relation routines that make use of
    the implementation technique of generating and evaling Perl code to do
    the actual work, which allows us to unroll what would otherwise be
    loops iterating over the attributes being ordered by; this should
    further yield better performance; both V2 and V1 have done this.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Changed the "summary" functional method
    by renaming its "result_attr_names" parameter to "summ_attr_names" and
    redefining its functionality more in terms of "extension" rather than
    "map"; the function given to "summ_func" must now just result in a
    tuple with attributes to add to a result which now already has all the
    attributes named by "group_per", rather than resulting in all
    attributes for the result.  The new version of "summary" should be much
    easier to use as presumably users always want to keep the attributes
    they are grouping per, and they now don't have to spell them out every
    time.  For the rare case where you want the old behaviour, now you have
    to do it manually with an explicit "cmpl_group" plus "map".

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Added, to the Set::Relation role and its
    composing classes, new functional method "cardinality_per_group" which
    is like "summary" but shorthands the common case where people just want
    a count of tuples per group and not any other information.

    * Set::Relation version 0.9.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.9.0.tar.gz.

    * (Relation.pm, V2.pm, V1.pm)  Added new functional method
    "classification" which is sort of a cross between "restriction" and
    "group"; it uses a Perl subroutine argument to partition a relation's
    tuples into an arbitrary number of groups.  It is named after Perl 6's
    "classify" operator, and is like List::MoreUtil's "part" function.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the Set::Relation role in several closely
    related ways.  Added new named parameter to 'new' named 'keys' which
    lets one define candidate keys for the new relation which the 'members'
    argument must satisfy for 'new' to succeed; a variety of format
    examples were included in the documentation.  Also updated the accessor
    method 'export_for_new' and added the accessor method 'keys' which take
    care of dumping the list of candidate keys that the relation object is
    known to satisfy.  Also added new functional method 'has_key' which
    tests whether the invocant relation has a certain candidate key; if it
    does, this method also has the side effect of remembering the fact for
    'keys' to return later.  It was also documented in a few places that
    these 'keys' are not constraints against future object mutations, and
    so they might be invalidated by 'insert' later for mutable objects.
    The ::Mutable role inherits all these changes.

    * (V2.pm)  Updated the Set::Relation::V2 class to implement the new
    features required by the above change item.  This is a fairly simple
    first draft of of the 'keys' feature and isn't very integrated yet, not
    any more than with V1; it currently doesn't have any positive impact on
    performance and it currently just provides an extra kind of constraint
    on new objects or an extra kind of validation on existing ones.

    * (V1.pm)  Updated the Set::Relation::V1 class to implement the new
    features required by the above change item.  The current implementation
    also is such that while 'insert' is smart enough to clear a candidate
    key iff it becomes violated, 'delete' will not restore or add any
    candidate key; you must invoke 'has_key' later to do that.  Also, like
    with indexes, all new relations derived from others such as by 'clone'
    or 'new' or relational operations will start out with no 'keys' for
    simplicity; presumably an upcoming V2 will be different.

2009-03-23

    * Set::Relation version 0.8.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.8.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the addition of a second bundled implementation
    of the Set::Relation role, called V2, which should have different (and
    hopefully better) performance characteristics than V1.  This release
    doesn't change the S::R public API in any particularly substantial way.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.72, Class::MOP
    to version 0.78.

    * (Set_Relation_5[0_Synopsis|1_Database_in_Depth_Example].t,
    Relation.pm)  Updated the test suite and the SYNOPSIS docs and the
    'new' submethod docs to avoid the repetition of the
    Set::Relation-implementing class name by creating a one-liner-per-file
    wrapper function over 'new' named 'relation' which is now used for all
    methodless S::R object creation.

    * (Set_Relation_5[0_Synopsis|1_Database_in_Depth_Example].t)  Updated
    the test suite internals to make them more modular; in each test file,
    refactored all the actual tests into a subroutine, so the set can be
    defined once and reinvoked for each bundled Set::Relation-doing class,
    when more than one of those (others besides V1.pm) come to exist.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated all 10 methods of the Set::Relation role that
    had a "Array|Str"-typed parameter named "[|\w+_]attrs" and renamed said
    parameter to "[|\w+_]attr_names"; any similarly named parameters that
    were of some other type, such as "Hash", kept their old names.  This
    change should make the parameters more self-documenting, since "attrs"
    names now tend to have both attribute names and values, where as
    "attr_names" have just names.  The changed 10 methods were: "slice",
    "has_attrs", "[|cmpl_]projection", "extension", "map", "summary",
    "substitution", "subst_in_[restr|semijoin]".  Note that, since all of
    the methods' parameters are positional (rather than named), the change
    is completely backwards compatible.

    * (V1.pm)  Updated the Set::Relation::V1 class to rename some of its
    public method parameters as per the previous change item.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added new performance-enhancing feature to the
    Set::Relation role, in the form of a new optional boolean parameter
    "allow_dup_tuples" for each of 17 methods.  Each Set::Relation-doing
    class has the option of honoring a true argument for that parameter by
    avoiding work involved in eliminating duplicate tuples and thereby
    having possibly different results or side-effects on said method
    invocations, due to what are partially multiset semantics being used
    instead of set semantics.  So users can explicitly request, on a
    case-by-case basis, to get possibly less accurate but "good enough"
    results in exchange for better performance.  Also added new
    documentation sub-section "Matters of Correctness" under the
    DESCRIPTION main section, that explains the feature.  The changed 17
    methods were: "export_for_new", "members", "body", "slice", "attr",
    "cardinality", "[|cmpl_]restriction", "restriction_and_cmpl",
    "extension", "map", "summary", "substitution"
    "[|static_]subst_in_restr", "subst_in_semijoin",
    "outer_join_with_exten".

    * (V1.pm)  Updated the Set::Relation::V1 class to add some public
    method parameters as per the previous change item.  However, this
    change is a no-op since the parameters are ignored in every case, with
    the semantics being the same as if they were never given arguments.

    * (Relation.pm, V1.pm)  Various other small updates and fixes.

    * Added new file lib/Set/Relation/V2.pm which is now the bundled second
    implementation of the Set::Relation role, and updated all the other
    relevant distribution files concerning it.  The new V2.pm initially
    started as a clone of V1.pm following all of the above change items,
    and then differentiated in 2 main ways:  The first is that V2 provides
    immutable objects (doesn't do ::Mutable) while V1 provides mutable
    objects.  The second is that V2 is lazy and will defer any tests for
    duplicate tuples as late as possible, while V1 is eager and will test
    for duplicate tuples as early as possible; V2 will also respect true
    "allow_dup_tuples" arguments, while V1 will ignore them.  Besides those
    2 matters and their associated large differences in performance
    profiles, V2 is essentially the same as V1, including that relation
    tuples are internally represented by Perl Hashes.  Also V2 just has a
    short DESCRIPTION pod section to start out, while V1's is longer.

2009-02-13

    * Set::Relation version 0.7.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.7.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.69.

    * Split up Relation.pm into itself and the new file
    lib/Set/Relation/V1.pm; Relation.pm now declares a role rather than a
    class, and V1.pm is a class doing that role.  Relation.pm now declares
    the Set::Relation API and keeps nearly all the old module
    documentation, and V1.pm has nearly all of the old code.  Moreover,
    Relation.pm now declares not one but 2 roles, Set::Relation and
    Set::Relation::Mutable, where the latter consumes the former and
    Set::Relation::V1 consumes the latter; the former role promises that
    its composing class' objects are immutable unless they also compose the
    latter.  The ::Mutable role got the 6 public methods ['clone',
    'has_frozen_identity', 'freeze_identity', 'evacuate', 'insert',
    'delete'] plus the 'has_frozen_identity' optional parameter of the
    'new' constructor, and the parent role got all the other public things.
    Also updated the test suite, and the SYNOPSIS pod, to account for this
    split, and they now invoke the ::V1 class directly rather than the
    shorter package name that is now a role.  The new class has exactly the
    same API as the old class.

    * Updated the TODO file to outline plans for a near future ::V2 class
    which represents tuples using Perl Array rather than Perl Hash.

2009-02-09

    * Set::Relation version 0.6.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.6.0.tar.gz.

    * As of this release, Set::Relation for Perl 5 directly uses the
    List::MoreUtils module to handle some of its detail work; this
    distribution has now gained a direct external dependency on the Perl 5
    module 'List::MoreUtils', which is not bundled with any version of Perl
    and will need to be installed from CPAN.  That said, List::MoreUtils
    was already a dependency of Set::Relation's existing Moose dependency,
    so the whole dependency tree has not enlarged.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added these 14 object methods: "wrap", "cmpl_wrap",
    "unwrap", "group", "cmpl_group", "ungroup", "summary",
    "join_with_group", "rank", "limit", "outer_join_with_group",
    "outer_join_with_undefs", "outer_join_with_static_exten",
    "outer_join_with_exten".  As of now, all of the pre-documented and
    TODO-marked object methods have been implemented.

    * (Relation.pm)  Replaced all instances of "__PACKAGE__->new(...)" with
    "$self->new(...)" etc, to help avoid potential future problems when
    someone tries to subclass the module.

    * (Relation.pm)  Various bug fixes and other small changes.

    * As of this release, Set::Relation is officially in alpha development
    status (was pre-alpha).  All of the initially planned functionality is
    now implemented, so it is feature complete, which is why it was moved
    out of pre-alpha status.  However most of the functionality has not
    been tested and so is not proven to actually work without error.  Once
    the module has a thorough test suite which passes, Set::Relation can be
    moved to beta or released status.

    * Set::Relation version 0.5.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.5.0.tar.gz.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added these 8 object methods (still 14 to go):
    "restriction_and_cmpl", "semijoin_and_diff", "substitution",
    "static_substitution", "subst_in_restr", "static_subst_in_restr",
    "subst_in_semijoin", "static_subst_in_semijoin".

    * (Relation.pm)  Other minor updates and fixes.

2009-02-05

    * Set::Relation version 0.4.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.4.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated external dependencies: Moose/etc to version 0.68.

    * As of this release, Set::Relation for Perl 5 uses the
    namespace::clean pragma for good hygiene; this distribution has now
    gained an external dependency on the Perl 5 module 'namespace::clean',
    which is not bundled with any version of Perl and will need to be
    installed from CPAN; namespace::clean also has a few not-bundled
    dependencies of its own.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added "use namespace::clean" statements inside the
    package declaration following any other "use" statements, so their
    exports into our package doesn't also become part of our own public API
    as a side-effect; the only exception is the "meta" method that Moose
    adds, which is kept.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added new documentation sub-section under
    "DESCRIPTION" named "Appropriate Uses For Set::Relation", which should
    hopefully answer some FAQs, such as why does the module exist, and
    pointing out some strengths and weaknesses.

    * (Relation.pm)  Corrected a forgetful oversight in the module
    documentation concerning Set::Relation's "has_frozen_identity" object
    attribute; this attribute had an auto-generated read-only public
    accessor method plus is automatically initialized from a same-named
    constructor method; added "has_frozen_identity" to the accessor method
    list, and updated the "new" constructor submethod signature.

    * (Relation.pm, Set_Relation_50_Synopsis.t,
    Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t)  Updated the "new"
    constructor submethod so that it now accepts a single positional
    argument as an invocation option, where before it just accepted named
    arguments (and it still does); a single positional argument to "new" is
    treated the same as a single "members" named argument.  This change
    means that the majority of current or anticipated future use cases of
    Set::Relation are now terser by about 9-11 characters ("members => ")
    per "new" invocation.  (This new feature was implemented mainly by
    adding a simple BUILDARGS method to Relation.pm.)  Updated all the
    examples and tests to use the new terser format.

    * (Relation.pm)  As a consequence of the previous change, the "new"
    constructor has also been updated so that the "members" argument is no
    longer allowed to be a Perl Hash (because a lone Hash positional
    argument is one of the standard Moose format options to supply named
    arguments) so any invocations of "new" which gave a Hash argument will
    have to become 2 characters ("[]") more verbose, wrapping it in an
    Array.  Removed the example using a Hash.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added the Moose concerning recommended practice
    "__PACKAGE__->meta()->make_immutable();" line to the end of the module,
    which should help performance regarding Moose-generated stuff; this
    would've been done before release 0.0.0 but was forgotten at the time.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated the "LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT" documentation
    section to change the Copyright declaration from "Darren Duncan" to
    "Muldis Data Systems, Inc." (which is wholly owned by Darren Duncan).

2009-02-02

    * Set::Relation version 0.3.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.3.0.tar.gz.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added these 5 object methods (still 20 to go):
    "slice", "attr", "has_attrs", "attr_names", "transitive_closure".

    * (Relation.pm)  Other minor updates and fixes.

2009-02-01

    * Set::Relation version 0.2.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.2.0.tar.gz.

    * (Relation.pm)  Added full documentation for the remaining 25 object
    methods that Set::Relation expects to have implemented prior to being
    moved to alpha development status; each is marked TODO in its title;
    this change item doesn't have a list of said methods, but when they are
    implemented in the next 1-3 releases, the change log will mention them
    simply as being new, same as if they hadn't been pre-documented now
    (and the TODO marker on their docs will be silently removed).

    * (Relation.pm)  Added placeholder code for said 25 TODO methods, each
    of which will die with an "unimplemented" message if invoked.

    * (Relation.pm)  Other minor code updates.

2009-01-31

    * Set::Relation version 0.1.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.1.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a few API changes, some significant feature
    additions, and bug fixes to existing routines, but no public facing
    routines have been added or removed.  New routines should feature in
    the next 0.Y.0 release.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated each of the 5 functional methods ["union",
    "exclusion", "intersection", "join", "product"] so it is now an N-adic
    operator rather than a dyadic operator.  Each method's "other"
    parameter was renamed to "others" and now takes either a single
    Set::Relation object as before or an Array of 0..N Set::Relation
    objects which is new.  With this change, these operators are now at
    feature parity with the Muldis D functions they are based on, except
    that they never handle the niladic option; being object methods, there
    is always at least one operand which is the invocant.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated each of the 4 functional methods
    ["[|cmpl_]restriction", "extension", "map"] to remove its optional
    "assuming" parameter.  This parameter was a fossil left over from the
    original Muldis D versions of these operators that the Perl version was
    ported from; the parameter was necessary in Muldis D to have reasonable
    flexibility due to Muldis D lacking certain other features that Perl
    has, which make this parameter unnecessary in Perl.  The removal was to
    keep the Perl simpler; it also sets the stage for the next change item.

    * (Relation.pm, Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t)  Updated
    each of the 4 functional methods ["[|cmpl_]restriction", "extension",
    "map"] so that the Perl routine supplied as its "func" argument is now
    assumed to have zero parameters rather than one, and the Perl routine
    is now supplied its input tuple/Hash in $_, same as how Perl's built-in
    map/grep operators work, rather than as a first/only argument.  Thanks
    to Todd Hepler for proposing that design change to "restriction" to
    make it more DWIM.

    * (Relation.pm, Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t)  Updated
    each of the 4 functional methods ["[|cmpl_]projection", "extension",
    "map"] so that the "[|result_]attrs" parameter can also take a Str
    argument rather than just an Array of Str argument.  Thanks to Todd
    Hepler for proposing that design change to "projection" to make it more
    DWIM.  Also updated the Set::Relation constructor submethod similarly,
    so its "members" parameter may also take a Str argument; this would
    produce a relation object with 1 attribute and zero tuples.

    * (Relation.pm)  Fixed an "insert" mutator method bug so it detects
    and blocks attempts to insert the invocant Set::Relation object into
    itself as a value-typed component, which would have had the side-effect
    of freezing the invocant, or would have conceptually been an infinite
    recursive deep copy operation; also fixed the "delete" mutator with
    the same detector since it would have had the same freezing problem.

    * (Relation.pm)  Updated all routines that take tuple-representing Hash
    values from the user, either directly or as tuple-valued attrs, either
    as a routine argument or a closure return value, so that each Hash is
    tested for circular references between itself or its value-typed
    components; this update fixes a general bug where the module could
    infinitely recurse when processing that input, since tuple-representing
    input from the user is deep-copied.

    * (Relation.pm)  Some POD reformatting:  Took what used to be the 5
    level-2 headings under the INTERFACE level-1 heading and changed said 5
    into level-1 headings, but did not uppercase their text.  Then
    converted the routine lists from being "=over/=item <routine>/=back" to
    each routine having its own level-2 heading.  For each routine, the new
    heading is just the short name of the routine, and the full signature
    of the routine displays just as its own paragraph.  All these changes
    combined should look visually like we are faking 3 levels of headings,
    with top and middle being upcased and mixed case "=head1" respectively.

    * (Relation.pm)  Minor code and POD updates and fixes.

2009-01-26

    * Set::Relation version 0.0.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.0.2.tar.gz.

    * (Relation.pm)  Fixed two instances of a bug in the "rename" method.
    Thanks to Todd Hepler for spotting the bug and providing a patch.

    * Added new test file "t/Set_Relation_51_Database_in_Depth_Example.t",
    which exercises more than a half-dozen Set::Relation methods that
    previously had no tests; the "rename" bugs were exposed when writing
    this.  Thanks to Todd Hepler who authored and contributed this file.

    * This distribution has gained a new direct external dependency on the
    Test::Deep module, which currently is only used by the new test file.

    * (Relation.pm)  Minor code comment fixes and POD updates.

2009-01-21

    * Set::Relation version 0.0.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.0.1.tar.gz.

    * (Relation.pm)  Fixed a bug in the "quotient" method, and further
    updated it with some special-case shortcuts.

    * (Relation.pm)  Other minor updates.

    * (README, Relation.pm)  Previously the FORUMS pod section of
    Relation.pm and 3 parts of the README file lacked content, and now they
    have it; added documentation about where the Set::Relation version
    control and support forums are.

2009-01-19

    * Set::Relation version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Set-Relation-0.0.0.tar.gz.

    * It constitutes a rewrite of Set::Relation for Perl 6 that had been
    made in 2006 but was never functional; the large body of work going
    into the Muldis D language and Muldis Rosetta framework during the
    intervening period also fed into this new Set::Relation module; it is
    expected that this new Set::Relation for Perl 5 will be ported to Perl
    6 in the near future and so upgrade that 2006 version; meanwhile, this
    Changes entry refers only to the Perl 5 version.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 Set::Relation distribution,
    and the first release of any distribution to contain a Perl 5 module
    named Set::Relation.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

    * As of this release, Set::Relation is officially in pre-alpha
    development status.

    * This is the initial complement of routines; besides the "new"
    constructor submethod, there are these 40 object methods: "clone",
    "export_for_new", "freeze_identity", "which", "members", "heading",
    "body", "evacuate", "insert", "delete", "degree", "is_nullary",

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * A Perl 6 project named "Relation" is started (complementary to the
    earlier existing to-be-named Muldis Rosetta project) which was intended
    to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary use in
    Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  The first commit
    was Pugs SVN rev 9938, on 2006-04-14, and Pugs 6.2.12 (2006-06-26)
    included it.  Hence 2006 is the start of the declared copyright date
    range for Set::Relation.

    * On 2006-07-04, renamed this Perl 6 project to "Set-Relation", which
    it remains to this day.  Pugs 6.2.13 and later included this.

    * The Perl 6 Set-Relation received various small updates thru
    2007-02-03 (Pugs SVN rev 15168), but is now stagnant; it will likely
    get un-stuck after the initially newer Perl 5 version is made to work.

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C.J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect what evolved into the Muldis Rosetta project, and also
    resulted in the genesis of the Set::Relation module.
