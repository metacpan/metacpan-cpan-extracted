NAME

    MojoX::Log::Fast - Log::Fast for Mojolicious

VERSION

    This document describes MojoX::Log::Fast version v1.0.1

SYNOPSIS

        use MojoX::Log::Fast;
    
        $app->log( MojoX::Log::Fast->new() );
    
        $app->log->config(...);
        $app->log->ident(...);

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Mojo::Log implementation that uses Log::Fast as
    the underlying log mechanism. It provides Log::Fast methods config(),
    ident() and all Mojo::Log methods except handle(), path() and format().

 LOG LEVELS

    Mojo::Log's fatal() processed same as error() because Log::Fast doesn't
    support that log level.

    Log::Fast's NOTICE() level not available because Mojo::Log doesn't
    support that log level.

INTERFACE

 new

            $log = MojoX::Log::Fast->new();
            $log = MojoX::Log::Fast->new( $logfast );

    If Log::Fast instance $logfast doesn't provided then
    Log::Fast->global() will be used by default.

 config

 ident

            $log->config( @params );
            $log->ident( @params );

    Proxy these methods with given @params to Log::Fast instance.

 handle

 path

    Not compatible with Log::Fast and thus not supported.

 format

    Not implemented yet, use much more flexible config() instead.

    Let me know if you needs it.
