If you want better support for older Perls, use CPAN::Reporter (Test::Reporter for CPANPLUS).
Also you can run cpan smoking. That way module can be fixed even before
you'll find that you need it. See CPAN::Reporter::Smoker.


Generally, you should use Test::Reporter - it's the only way to measure popularity
of distribution. Why do anything with it, if it is not used.


Patches welcome. Please write tests for error you found.
