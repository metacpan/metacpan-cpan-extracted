   - add --file parameter to 'hi' (via zhmylove, thanks)

2.7191_1: Thu Mar 26 2015
   - some of my tests are failing and one of them is a total mystery

2.7191: Wed Mar 25 2015
   - resolve these vile -CA bugs
   - remove open SYMBOL usages in t/ and replace with IPC::Run
     or open my $mem, '>', \my $str
   - switched from File::Slurp to Path::Tiny — not at all concerned about the
     controversy or the implications of using slurp() from an author-only test
     … I Just like Path::Tiny

2.7191: Sun Mar 22 2015
   - Experimenting with a new _hashed_ color that's random space madness hashed for each match

   - little fixes and things

2.7187: Sun Jun 22 2014
   - taught App::HI how to list all the colors
   - XXX: interestingly, I can modify the color stack in %ENV, no reason to do
     the weird scope hacking; project for later I guess
     (There's also a coloralias() sub now, but you can't replace standard
     colors, so it's not useful here.)
   - use color() and colorvalid() instead of more scope hacking
   - export color() and colorvalid() (et al) insteadof scope hacking
   - move most of the hi command to App::HI
   - changed my mind on black and pitch.  Reversing them.
   - black is black, pitch is bold black; emotional problems solved.  Hrm,
     coal.  Maybe coal?  Heck, I put that too.
