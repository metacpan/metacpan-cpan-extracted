Features, that are planned to be implemented before 1.0 release include:

== Next ==
- see http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2008/02/thingisbn-adds-lccns-oclc-numbers.php
  and http://search.cpan.org/~anirvan/WebService-LibraryThing-ThingISBN-0.503/lib/WebService/LibraryThing/ThingISBN.pm
- Server-parameter: factory (to create id) and idtype (to create id)
- rewrite/fix DBI and include tests

-- seeealso-dbi: insert, delete, create, update etc.
- rewrite Identifier::GND
- better support of "$enrich"
- document RDF and other formats
- modify SeeAlso::Response to better access (see i2w.pl)
- move osd to SeeAlso::Source ?
- add example of wrapper SeeAlso simple to SeeAlso full (via Client)
- update ThingISBN and make it an example script (not a class)
- Add multiple example parameters (see pnd2gso)
- Print errors to error logfile in SeeAlso::Server
- add and describe minimal server example (examples/server.pl)
- add Wikipedia2ISBN example
- add SeeAlso::Collection (also as SeeAlso::Source)
    returns description() as response or list of members
- Finish SeeAlso::Client (including tests and examples, OSDD...)
-- Parse OSDD for SeeAlso::Client
- check whether insert statement in DBI failed
- add caching of config files in expand_from_config
- DBI does not load Description settings?
- Add showservices.xsl (multiple) in addition to showservice.xsl (for collections)
- remove Logger
- fix: --(Thomas Berger):

openSearchDescription darf nicht callback={callback} enthalten,
weil "callback" kein Standardparameter ist, sondern nur "extension".
Es muesste sich reparieren lassen als

callback={seealso:callback?}

Implement a simple RDF2SeeAlso Wrapper, e.g.
http://cal.aksw.org/year/Y2010

== Tests ==
- Add more Unicode tests from toJSON and fromJSON!
- Test servers with SeeAlso::Client
- (See L<TAP::Harness> and L<Test::Harness>)
- Add a management class for multiple services
-- SeeAlso::Collection

= Redesign =
- Create unAPI::Server to base on
- Better support of OpenSearch Description (more fields), maybe with OpenSearch::Description
-- title, description, url, date, example, example response, normalize, source
- Rewrite SeeAlso::Source::DBI to SeeAlso::CRUD or SeeAlso::Store
-- Better/more loading mechanism for SeeAlso::Source::DBI
-- Names of ::Store methods: retrieve/insert/update/delete
-- simplify ETL-examples (thingISBN and Wikipedia)
-- detect/remove full duplicates (better database index?)
- have a look at uri-isbn.t in L<URI> and allow wrapping
  of any URI as SeeAlso::Identifier

== Misc ==
- Add normalization of content (SeeAlso::Response)
- Add SeeAlso::Discovery to discover servers via OpenSearch Description 
- Support WADL and WSDL in addition to OpenSearch Description
- Run as a real server (on a port of your choice) : better performance?
- Add SeeAlso::Source::Union and example (with: use threads;)
- Add an example of a multilangual source with equal identifiers: LibraryThing?
- More Unicode (UTF-8) testing and hints
- restrict access of cgi server by referrer, IP, etc. (better in .htaccess ?)
- add a REST-server that eats SeeAlso response format via 
  HTTP POST (new), HTTP PUT (add) and HTTP DELETE (delete).
  Response formats and status codes need to be defined for this
- remove Date::Parse prequisite
- clean up the code
-- look for TODOs
-- look for missing documentation 

== Examples ==
- Add/improve Wikipedia/LibraryThing examples
-- rewrite, test and document ETL cycle
- Feed2Seealso (RSS2Seealso, ATOM2Seealso)

== JavaScript client ==
- Document purpose and usage

== XSLT client ==
- Add example result check
- Check out: IE seems to have problem with iframe and document(.) ?
