1.24    Aug 23, 2025

		letters.

1.25    Aug 27, 2025

        Improved testing

1.26    Aug 28, 2025

        Apparently my new testing methodology ticked off some CPAN testers.
		So I'll relax them a bit.

        Changed the license.

1.27    Aug 10, 2025

        Fixed a runaway loop in "-t" output.
		
		Removed the "one character at a time" output left over from the

        Fixed ALL POD issues.  Ugh.

1.36    Oct 28, 2025

        Changed the tokens and help screen.  Added more descriptions including
		Indication of original 16 colors for limited terminals.

1.37    Oct 29, 2025

        Tokens output defaults to only the 16 colors and the new "expanded"
		option will show all color tokens.
		
		Unicode output defaults to a squashed output and the new "expanded"
		option will show dividers between each row to better discern symbol
		output.

1.38    Oct 30, 2025

        Added more frame styles

        Added even more frame styles

1.40    Nov 02, 2025

        The "expanded" option is removed.  It now depends on the COLORTERM
		environment variable and the "truecolor" value.

1.41    Nov 02, 2025

        Version 1.40 removed from CPAN.  The "--expanded" option re-added.
		However, the default is to respond to the "COLORTERM" enviroment
		value.  The "--expanded" option reverses the default.

		Note:  "--expanded" only applies to the "--tokens" option.

1.42    Nov 06, 2025

        Ok, I know it's frustrating, but I completely removed the "expanded"
		option.  Full detection of 256 color and truecolor capability has been
		implemented.

1.43    Nov 06, 2025

        The "tokens" option has a more informative output for all of the
		various color types.  This had the side effect of more available
		tokens.

1.44    Nov 06, 2025

        Internal token handling improved.

        "tokens" option output also improved

1.45    Nov 11, 2025
