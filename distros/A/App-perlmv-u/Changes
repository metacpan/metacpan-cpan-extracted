0.006   2021-05-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: high

	- [build] Rebuild to update Sah coercion module names (old Sah coercion
          modules have been purged from CPAN).


0.005   2017-08-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] [ux] Don't use last value of code because a
	  common trap is using e 's/.../.../' and user will be surprised that
	  when string is not changed, the filename gets changed to '1' (result
	  of s///); this also makes perlmv-u behave more like perlmv.


0.004   2017-08-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Redo (as well as undo) should redo (undo) the most
	  recently undone (done) action.


0.003   2017-08-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Don't rename to NAME.1 if name doesn't change.


0.002   2017-08-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Use Sereal instead of JSON for faithful bytes serialization (even
	  YAML::XS uses utf8 transformation).
