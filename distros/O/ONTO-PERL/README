ONTO-PERL suite
===============

ONTO-PERL a collection of PERL modules for dealing with any OBO-formatted
ontology (such as the Gene Ontology). This code distribution gathers 
object-oriented modules (for dealing with ontology elements such as 
Term, Relationship, Synonym and so forth), scripts (for typical tasks 
such as format conversions: obo2rdf, rdf2obo; ONTO-perl provides an 
extensive documentation as well as several examples that can be easily 
adapted for specific applications that involve ontology processing), and 
a set of test files to ensure the suite's implementation quality.
