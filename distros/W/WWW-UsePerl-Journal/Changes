0.22    2008-09-29
        - patch by Dave Rolsky to fix the login code, to match recent updates

        - updated optional tests.
        - closed security risk in entrytitled (RT#37177 - thanks Yanick)

0.21    2007-11-07
        - updated date testing to try and capture problems CPAN testers are
          seeing.
        - updated an entry test in the event no content is returned.

0.20    2007-11-07
        - username or userid MUST be provided to new().
        - added debug() method to turn internal debugging on or off.
        - internal function _journalsearch_content renamed to _recent_content().
        - added debug testing script.

0.19    2007-11-05
        - fixed user names with other characters in aside from \w.
        - rewrote the the recent list testing, as posts can appear between
          extracts.
        - missing entries can have to 2 different error messages, depending
          upon context.
        - added futher diagnostics in the event of errors.

0.18    2007-11-04
        - changed constants to variable due to suprious errors from 
          Test::Pod::Coverage.
        - added raw() functions for debugging purposes.
        - changed date processing slightly, hopefully this finally fixes those
          errors. (thanks to Andreas and Slaven for the feedback)

0.17    2007-10-31
        - Still getting CPAN Tester failures :( It looks like use.perl is
          timing out, as it's unable to reference the test users (russell and 
          147 (koschei)). The tests now skip, reporting the error, so I can
          keep an eye on it.
        - More error reporting in tests if results not as expected, so that
          CPAN Testers reports can hopefully identify specific problems.

0.16    2007-03-14
        - relaxed date testing, as timezones can affect the date/time value
          returned.

0.15    2007-03-05
        - fixed several test bugs, including the date parsing issues.
        - WUJ::Post->new() now takes a hash as it states in the docs.
        - Rewrote some of the internals so they correctly cache results. 
        - Bit of an overhaul of the code so that underlying Entry objects are 
          returned more appropriate, with the caller able to access the Entry
          methods more directly. 
        - Error handling rewritten so the modules don't fail under pressure,
          just return undef and set an $j->error().
        - Post.pm has had a fresh look and form completion has been updated.
        - Lots more testing, including developer only tests (not included).
        - Handwritten META.yml to conform to current specs.
        - Changed all instances of LICENCE to LICENSE.
        - Added META.yml test script.
        - Added LICENSE file.
        - Renamed the contrib directory to examples.
        - POD/README updates.
        - Devel::Cover - 93.3% (including developer only tests)

        - Fix for change in the title HTML
        - Date code is still broken - it is out by the timezone of the user
          who wrote the entry, this may not be fixable if we cannot
          determine that user's timezone.

0.10    2002-10-14T10:51:25+01:00

        - Gets date information from posts
        - "It produces potentially weird results due to time zones. But I believe
          they are consistently weird. Will probably break if the user logs in."
