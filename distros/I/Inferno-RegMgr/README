DESCRIPTION

    Using OS Inferno registry(4) is simple, but in case connection to
    registry become broken (because of network issues or even registry
    restart) you have to manually reconnect to registry and restore state
    (register your services once again, find out changes in services you're
    using now, etc.). Inferno::RegMgr will do this work for you
    automatically.

    Inferno::RegMgr has plugin-based architecture. There two plugin types:
    connection (which handle I/O to registry server) and task (like
    registering your service or searching for services).

     Connection plugins:
        Inferno::RegMgr::TCP
     Task plugins:
        Inferno::RegMgr::Service
        Inferno::RegMgr::Lookup
        Inferno::RegMgr::Monitor

    When you creating new Inferno::RegMgr object, you should provide
    connection plugin, which will be used to access registry. Next you can
    attach/detach to this Inferno::RegMgr object any amount of any task
    plugins. Inferno::RegMgr will guarantee all these tasks will work when
    connection to registry is available, and task's state will be
    automatically restored after reconnecting to registry server.

    This is EV-based module, so you have to run EV::loop in your code to
    use this module.

INTERFACE

    new( $connection_plugin )

      Create new Inferno::RegMgr object, configured to use
      $connection_plugin to access registry. (All task plugins attached to
      this object also will use that connection plugin.)

      If you lose all references to returned Inferno::RegMgr object all
      attached tasks will be stopped and detached, all memory used by all
      plugins will be freed (unless you will keep references to some
      plugins).

      Return Inferno::RegMgr object.

    attach( $task_plugin )

      Attached plugin will start working as soon as connection to registry
      will be available. Reference to this plugin will be stored in
      Inferno::RegMgr object until that plugin will be detach()ed.

      You need to keep reference to attached task plugin only if you wanna
      stop (detach()) it later or if that plugin object provide additional
      features.

      Return nothing.

    detach( $task_plugin )

      Given $task_plugin should be same as used in attach() method before.
      It will be stopped and detached (but it still may keep some state,
      which will may be reused if that plugin will be attach()ed again).

      Return nothing.

FOR PLUGIN DEVELOPERS

 CONNECTION PLUGIN INTERFACE

    open_new()

    update()

    open_find()

    open_event()

      These methods must be provided by connection plugin. Their parameters
      and return values listed at Inferno::RegMgr::TCP.

 TASK PLUGIN INTERFACE

    {manager}

      This property will be set in plugin object to reference to
      Inferno::RegMgr object in attach(), and will be set to undef in
      detach(). Plugin should use it to access Inferno::RegMgr object it
      attached to.

      Usually plugin need Inferno::RegMgr object to access it property
      {registry}, which contain reference to connection plugin object used
      to access registry. Another uses of Inferno::RegMgr object from task
      plugin is to detach() itself or attach() another task plugins.

    START()

    STOP()

    REFRESH()

      These methods must be provided by task plugin. Their doesn't has
      parameters and doesn't return anything. Inferno::RegMgr will call
      START() when connection to registry become available, STOP() when
      connection to registry lost, and REFRESH() when registry state
      changes (new service registered, server change it attributes, service
      unregistered).

DIAGNOSTICS

    already attached

      You're trying to attach() object which is already attached to this or
      another Inferno::RegMgr object.

    not attached to this manager

      You're trying to detach() object which isn't attached to this
      Inferno::RegMgr object.
