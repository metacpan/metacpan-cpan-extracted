=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Constructor

The constructor returns a handle to one LXD server. It's address is specified via an B<endpoint>
parameter, be it of an HTTPS or of a UNIX socket kind.

If you are working with a non-default LXD project in mind, then you should also provide that
project's name with the B<project> parameter. Background operation polling will make use of
that. Note, that when invoking any of the methods here, you will still have to specify that project,
unless it is the C<default> one, of course.

As we are operating under an L<IO::Async> regime here, the handle also needs a B<loop> parameter to
the central event loop. The handle will also regularily poll autonomously the server which
operations are still running or have completed. The optional parameter B<polling_time> controls how
often that will occur; it will default to 1 sec, if not provided.

As LXC can be accessed remotely only via HTTPS, TLS (SSL) parameters must be provided. These will be
forwarded directly to
L<IO::Socket::SSL|https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::SSL#Description-Of-Methods>. But, specifically,
one should consider to provide:

=over

=item * B<client certificate>, via a proper subset of C<SSL_cert_file>, C<SSL_key_file>, C<SSL_cert> and C<SSL_key>.
(Look at the L</HINTS> section to generate such a certificate for LXD.)

=item * B<server fingerprint>, via C<SSL_fingerprint>
(Look at the L</HINTS> section how to figure this out.)

=back

=head2 Methods

All methods below are automatically generated from the L<LXD REST API Spec|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxc/lxd/master/doc/rest-api.yaml>.
They should work with API version 1.0.


Let's dissect method invocations with this example:

   my $f = $lxd->instance_state( name => 'test1' );
   my $r = $f->get;

=over

=item *

All invocations return a L<Future>. Thus they can be combined, sequenced, run in "parallel", etc. If
you need to wait for a definite result, then you will block the flow with C<-E<gt>get>.

Polling is done behind the scenes and will watch for all operations which either succeeded or
failed. Those will mark the associated future as C<done> or C<failed>. Normally, you will never need
to use the methods for 'Operations' yourself; they are still offered as fallback.

=item *

The result of each fully completed invocation is either

=over

=item *

the string C<success>, or

=item *

a Perl HASH ref which reflects the JSON data sent from the LXD server. Note, that Booleans have to
be treated special, by using C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true>. Otherwise, they follow B<exactly> the
structure in the specification.

=item *

or a HASH ref with keys C<stdin> and C<stdout> if this is a result of the C<execute_in_instance>
method.

=back

=item *

If an operation failed, then the associated future will be failed, together with the reason of the
failure from the server. If you do not cater with that, then this will - as usual with C<IO::Async>
- raise an exception, with the failure as string.

=item *

Methods named like the type of server object (e.g. C<cluster>, C<certificate>, C<image>) are
normally "getter/setter" methods. The getter obviously returns the state of the object. The method
becomes a setter, if the additional C<body> field together with a Perl HASH ref is passed:

   my $f = $lxd->instance_state( name => 'test1',
                                 body => {
                                   action   => "start",
				   force    => JSON::false,
				   stateful => JSON::false,
				   timeout  => 30,
 			         } );

How a specific object is addressed, is detailed in each method below; usually you provide a C<name>,
C<id>, C<fingerprint>, or similar. You may also have to provide a C<project>, if not being the
I<default project>.

That HASH ref also follows the structure outlined in the specification for that particular endpoint.

=item *

Methods named like a type of server object (e.g. C<certificates>) normally return a list of
identifiers for such objects.

=item *

Many methods request changes in the LXD server. The names are taken from the specification, but are
adapted to better reflect what is intended:

=over

=item *

Methods which change the state of the remote object usually are called C<modify>_I<something>.

=item *

Methods which add a new object to a collection are usually called C<add>_I<something>, or
C<create>_I<something>, depending on how it sounds better.

=item *

Methods which remove an object from a collection are usually called C<delete>_I<something>.

=head2 Certificates

=over

=item * B<add_certificate>

Adds a certificate to the trust store.
In this mode, the `password` property is always ignored.

=back

=item * B<add_certificate_untrusted>

Adds a certificate to the trust store as an untrusted user.
In this mode, the `password` property must be set to the correct value.

The `certificate` field can be omitted in which case the TLS client
certificate in use for the connection will be retrieved and added to the
trust store.

The `?public` part of the URL isn't required, it's simply used to
separate the two behaviors of this endpoint.

Renames, moves a storage volume between pools or migrates an instance to another server.

The returned operation metadata will vary based on what's requested.
For rename or move within the same server, this is a simple background operation with progress data.
For migration, in the push case, this will similarly be a background
operation with progress data, for the pull case, it will be a websocket
operation with a number of secrets to be passed to the target server.

=head1 PSEUDO OBJECT ORIENTATION

Just for the sake of experimentation, I added a sub-package C<lxd::instance>. To add OO-flavour, you
simply bless the instance HASH with it:

    my $r = $lxd->instance( name => "my-container" )->get;
    my $i = bless $r, 'lxd::instance';

From then on, the following methods can operate on it:

=over

=item * C<restart>

=item * C<start>

=item * C<freeze>

=item * C<unfreeze>

=item * C<stop>

=item * C<state>

=back

Well, I'm not a big fan of objects.


=head1 EXAMPLES

I encourage you to look at the C<02_instances.t> test suite. It will show a complete life cycle for
containers.

=head1 HINTS

=item * How to generate an SSL client certificate for LXD

First, I found one client certificate (plus the key) in my installation at:

   /root/snap/lxd/common/config/

Alternatively, L<you can run your own small CA, generate a .crt and .key for a client, and then
add it to lxd to trust it|https://serverfault.com/questions/882880/authenticate-to-lxd-rest-api-over-network-certificate-auth-keeps-failing>.

More on this topic is L<here|https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/authentication/>

=item * How to find the SSL fingerprint for an LXD server

With recent versions of LXD this is fairly easy:

   $ lxc info|grep fingerprint

It is a SHA265 hash, so you will have to prefix it with C<sha256$> (no blanks) when you pass it to C<SSL_fingerprint>.

Alternatively, you can try to find the server certificate and use C<openssl> to derive a fingerprint of your choice.
