=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lemonldap::NG is a modular Web-SSO based on Apache::Session modules. It
simplifies the build of a protected area with a few changes in the application.

It manages both authentication and authorization and provides headers for
accounting. So you can have a full AAA protection for your web space as
described below.

The portal part inherits from L<CGI> so yo can use it both with Apache 1 and 2
and use all L<CGI> features.

=head2 Authentication, Authorization, Accounting

=head3 B<Authentication>

If a user isn't authenticated and attempts to connect to an area protected by a
Lemonldap::NG compatible handler, he is redirected to a portal. The portal
authenticates user with a ldap bind by default, but you can also use another
authentication sheme like using x509 user certificates (see
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthSSL> for more).

Lemonldap::NG use session cookies generated by L<Apache::Session> so as secure as a
128-bit random cookie. You may use the C<securedCookie> options of
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal> to avoid session hijacking if all your protected sites
use https.

You have to manage life of sessions by yourself since Lemonldap::NG knows nothing
about the L<Apache::Session> module you've choosed, but it's very easy using a
simple cron script because L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal> stores the start time in the
C<_utime> field.
The purgeCentralCache provided in C<example/> directory can help you to do it.
By default, a session stay 10 minutes in the Handler local storage, so in the
worth case, a user is authorized 10 minutes after he lost his rights.

=head3 B<Authorization>

Authorization is controlled only by handlers because the portal knows nothing
about the way the user will choose. When configuring your Web-SSO, you have to:

=over

=item * choose the ldap attributes you want to use to manage accounting and
authorization (see C<exportedHeaders> parameter in L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal>
documentation),

=item * create Perl expression to define user groups (using ldap attributes):
optional, this mechanism is available with Lemonldap::NG::*::SharedConf
modules,

=item * create an array foreach virtual host associating URI regular
expressions and Perl expressions to use to grant access.

=back

=head4 Example

Exported variables (in Lemonldap::NG::Portal, will be stored in
configuration database):

  exportedVars => {
      cn            => "cn",
      departmentUID => "departmentUID",
      login         => "uid",
  },

User groups (stored in configuration database with L<Lemonldap::NG::Manager>):

  groups => {
      group1 => '{ $departmentUID eq "unit1" or $login = "xavier.guimard" }',
      ...
  },

Area protection (stored in configuration database with
L<Lemonldap::NG::Manager>):

  locationRules => {
      www1.domain.com => {
          '^/protected/.*$' => '$groups =~ /\bgroup1\b/',
          default           => 'accept',
      },
      www2.domain.com => {
          '^/site/.*$' => '$uid eq "xavier.guimard" or $groups =~ /\bgroup2\b/',
          '^/(js|css)' => 'accept',
          default      => 'deny',
      },
  },

=head4 Performance

You can use Perl expressions as complicated as you want and you can use all
the exported LDAP attributes (and create your own attributes: see examples in
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal> distribution) both in groups evaluations and area
protections (you just have to call them with a "$").

You have to be careful when choosing your expressions:

=over

=item * C<groups> are evaluated each time a user is redirected to the portal,

=item * C<locationRules> are evaluated for each request.

=back

It is also recommended to use the C<groups> mechanism to avoid having to
evaluate a long expression at each HTTP request:

  locationRules => {
      www1.domain.com => {
          '^/protected/.*$' => '$groups =~ /\bgroup1\b/',
      },
  },

You can also use ldap filters in C<groups> parameter, or Perl expression or
mixed expressions. Perl expressions has to be enclosed with C<{}>:

=over

=item * C<group1 =E<gt> '(|(uid=xavier.guimard)(ou=unit1))'>

=item * C<group1 =E<gt> '{$uid eq "xavier.guimard" or $ou eq "unit1"}'>

=item * C<group1 =E<gt> '(|(uid=xavier.guimard){$ou eq "unit1"})'>

=back

It is also recommended to use Perl expressions to avoid requiring the LDAP
server more than 2 times per authentication.

=head3 B<Accounting>

=head4 I<Logging portal access>

L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal> doesn't log anything by default, but it's easy to overload
C<log> method for normal portal access or using C<error> method to know what
was wrong if C<process> method has failed.

=head4 I<Logging application access>

Because an handler knows nothing about the protected application, it can't do
more than logging URL. As Apache does this fine, L<Lemonldap::NG::Handler> gives it
the name to used in logs. The C<whatToTrace> parameters indicates which
variable Apache has to use (C<$uid> by default).

The real accounting has to be done by the application itself which knows the
result of SQL transaction for example.

Lemonldap::NG can export http headers either using a proxy or protecting directly
the application. By default, the C<User-Auth> field is used but you can change
it using the C<exportedHeaders> parameters (stored in the configuration
database). This parameters contains an associative array:

=over

=item * B<keys> are the names of the chosen headers

=item * B<values> are perl expressions where you can use user datas stored in
the global store by calling them C<$E<lt>varnameE<gt>>.

=back

Example:

  exportedHeaders => {
      www1.domain.com => {
          'Auth-User' => '$uid',
          'Unit'      => '$ou',
      },
      www2.domain.com => {
          'Authorization' => '"Basic ".encode_base64($employeeNumber.":dummy", "")',
      },
  }

=head2 Storage systems

Lemonldap::NG use 3 levels of cache for authenticated users:

=over

=item * an Apache::Session::* module choosed with the C<globalStorage>
parameter (completed with C<globalglobalStorageOptions>) and used by
L<lemonldap::NG::Portal> to store authenticated user parameters,

=item * a L<Cache::Cache> module choosed with the C<localStorage> parameter
(completed with C<localStorageOptions> and used to share authenticated users
between Apache's threads or processus and of course between virtual hosts,

=item * Lemonldap::NG variables: if the same user use the same thread or
processus a second time, no request are needed to grant or refuse access. This
is very efficient with HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive system.

=back

So the number of request to the central storage is limited to 1 per user each
10 minutes.

Lemonldap::NG is very fast, but you can increase performance using a
L<Cache::Cache> module that does not use disk access.

=head2 Logout system

Lemonldap::NG provides a single logout system: you can use it by adding a link
to the portal with "logout=1" parameter (See Synopsis) and/or by configuring
Handler to intercept some URL directly in the manager interface and/or in
Apache configuration file (See L<Lemonldap::NG::Handler>). The logout system:

=over

=item * delete session in the global session storage,

=item * replace Lemonldap::NG cookie by '',

=item * delete handler caches only if logout action was started from a
protected application and only in the current Apache server. So in other
servers, session is still in cache for 10 minutes maximum if the user was
connected on it in the last 10 minutes.

=back

=head2 Existing sessions

By default, when a user tries to connect to the portal with a valid cookie,
the portal proposes a new authentication. This behaviour can be change easily
by changing C<existingSession> sub :

  use Lemonldap::NG::Portal::SharedConf qw(:all);
  
  my $portal = Lemonldap::NG::Portal::SharedConf->new ( {
                existingSession => sub {PE_DONE},
                configStorage => ...
                ...
  });

=head1 PORTAL OPTIONS

=head2 Manager options

All options here can be set both in the manager interface and in the
constructor ($portal->new()). Local arguments have the precedence on
arguments set by the manager.

=over

=item * ldapPort: tcp port used by ldap server.

=item * ldapBase: base of the ldap directory.

=item * managerDn: dn to used to connect to ldap server. By default, anonymous
bind is used.

=item * managerPassword: password to used to connect to ldap server. By
default, anonymous bind is used.

=item * securedCookie : set it to 1 if you want to protect user cookies.

=item * cookieName : name of the cookie used by Lemonldap::NG (lemonldap by
default).

=item * domain : cookie domain. You may have to give it else the SSO will work
only on your server.

=item * globalStorage : required: L<Apache::Session> library to used to store
session information.

=item * globalStorageOptions : parameters to bind to L<Apache::Session> module

=item * locationRules : this parameter is used by L<Lemonldap::NG::Handler> to
read the rules.

=item * authentication: sheme to authenticate users (default: "ldap"). It can
be set to:

=over

=item * ldap : authentication is done by LDAP bind

=item * SSL : the portal reads SSL variables issued from Apache SSL
authentication. See L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthSSL> for more.

=item * CAS : use CAS system to authenticate users. See
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthCAS> for more.

=item * Apache : the authentication is done by Apache configuration and the
portal reads the environment variable C<REMOTE_USER> to search the user in
the LDAP server. This can be used to authenticate users by Kerberos.

=item * LA : Liberty-Alliance mechanism. WARNING : at the moment, you have to
use directly L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthLA> because this target does not
work.

=back

=back

=head2 Local options

Those options can not be set using the manager but have to be passed to the
constructor (new()).

=over

=item * configStorage I<(required for Lemonldap::NG::Portal::SharedConf)> :
describe how to find configuration generated by L<Lemonldap::NG::Manager>. See
L<Lemonldap::NG::Common::Conf> for more

=item * caPath, caFile : if you use ldap+tls you can overwrite cafile or capath
options with those parameters. This is useful if you use a shared
configuration.

=item * ldapPpolicyControl : set it to 1 if you want to use LDAP Password
Policy

=item * ldapGroupBase : this parameter can be used to store in the Lemonldap::NG
groups system all the LDAP groups that contains the user. Set here the LDAP base
of the LDAP groups. Example : C<"dmdName=groups,dc=example,dc=com">.

=item * I<methodName> : all method used by the process sub can be overloaded
simply using an option that referenced a sub. See
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::Simple> for more.

=back

CAS authentication options :

=over

=item * CAS_url, CAS_CAFile, CAS_loginUrl, CAS_validationUrl : see
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthCAS> for more

=back

Liberty-Alliance authentication options :

=over

=item * laSp, laIdpsFile, laStorage, laLdapLoginAttribute, localStorage,
localStorageOptions, laDebug : see L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthLA> for more.

=back

SSL authentication options :

=over

=item * SSLVar : the name of the SSL variable to read. Default to
SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email.

=back

=head1 USING LEMONLDAP::NG::PORTAL FOR DEVELOPMENT

Lemonldap::NG::Portal provides different modules:

=over

=item * L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::Simple>: base module to build a portal,

=item * L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::Auth*>: authentication modules that modify
authentication scheme.

=item * L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::AuthLA>: specific module to used
Liberty-Alliance mechanisms to authenticate users

=item * L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::SharedConf>: this module provide the ability
to read portal configuration from a central database. It inherits from
L<Lemonldap::NG::Portal::Simple>. It's the more used module.
