NAME
    HTML::HTML5::Microdata::ToRDFa - rewrite HTML5+Microdata into XHTML+RDFa

SYNOPSIS
     use HTML::HTML5::Microdata::ToRDFa;
     my $rdfa = HTML::HTML5::Microdata::ToRDFa->new($html, $baseuri);
     print $rdfa->get_string;

DESCRIPTION
    This module may be used to convert HTML documents marked up with
    Microdata into XHTML+RDFa 1.0 (which is more widely implemented by
    consuming software).

    If the input document uses a mixture of Microdata and RDFa, the
    semantics of the output document may be incorrect.

  Constructor
    "$rdfa = HTML::HTML5::Microdata::ToRDFa->new($html, $baseuri)"
        $html may be an HTML document (as a string) or an
        XML::LibXML::Document object.

        $baseuri is the base URI for resolving relative URI references. If
        $html is undefined, then this module will fetch $baseuri to obtain
        the document to be converted.

  Public Methods
    "$rdfa->get_string"
        Get the document converted to RDFa as a string. This will be
        well-formed XML, but not necessarily valid XHTML.

    "$rdfa->get_dom"
        Get the document converted to XHTML+RDFa as an XML::LibXML::Document
        object.

        Note that each time "get_string" and "get_dom" are called, the
        conversion process is run from scratch. Repeatedly calling these
        methods is wasteful.
