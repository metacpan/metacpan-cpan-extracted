<h1>BuzzSaw - Filters</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
After each log entry has been parsed into its constituent parts it is
next passed on to the data filtering stage of the importer
pipeline. This is the stage at which decisions are made as to whether
a log entry should be stored into the database.
</p>

<p>
If no filters have been specified then the importer process will
import all entries into the database. Otherwise, if there are 1 or
more filters, then no entries are accepted by default, at least one
filter must declare an interest in a log entry for it to be
stored. Each log entry is passed through the entire stack of filters
in the order in which they were specified, filtering does not stop
after any one plugin has declared an interest.
</p>

<p>
As well as declaring an interest in a particular log entry filters are
permitted to attach tags and associate other information with an
entry, which will be stored in the database for later retrieval
(e.g. when generating reports). The result of this is that subsequent
filters can make decisions and do further processing based on the
results of filters earlier in the pipeline. It is worth noting however
that an entry will be accepted if ANY filter declares an interest, it
is not possible for filters later in the stack to overturn the results
of those previous in the stack. It is possible to make decisions in
one filter based on the results of previous filters. There are no
limits to what processing you may do on each log entry but clearly
when the filter has to be run on every entry and there might be
millions to process it is worth doing only the minimum required if you
want the entire process to complete in a reasonable amount of time.
</p>

<h2>Structure of a log entry</h2>

<p>
When an entry is successfully parsed the separate parts are placed
into a simple Perl hash - for speed reasons this is not done in an
Object-Oriented style. The following elements will be available for
querying during the filtering stage.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>year</em> - year part of date string</li>
  <li><em>month</em> - month part of date string</li>
  <li><em>day</em> - day part of date string</li>
  <li><em>hour</em> - hour part of date string</li>
  <li><em>minute</em> - minute part of date string</li>
  <li><em>second</em> - second part of date string</li>
  <li><em>nanosecond</em> - nanosecond part of date string (or zero
  if not specified in the log entry)</li>
  <li><em>time_zone</em> - time zone part of date string (or UTC if
  not specified in the log entry)</li>
  <li><em>hostname</em> - hostname part of log entry</li>
  <li><em>program</em> - program part of log entry (undefined if not specified)</li>
  <li><em>pid</em> - pid part of log entry (undefined if not specified)</li>
  <li><em>message</em> - message part of the log entry</li>
  <li><em>raw</em> - original log entry string</li>
  <li><em>digest</em> - Base64 encoded version of the SHA256 digest
  for the original log entry</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that syslog entries come in a huge variety of styles so some
fields such as <em>program</em> and <em>pid</em> are not always
specified. Even when they are present it is not always that easy to
extract the information without making the regular expression wildly
complicated. For details on how the strings are parsed see the
documentation for <code>BuzzSaw::Parser</code>
and <code>BuzzSaw::Parser::RFC3339</code>.
</p>

<h2>Implementing a Filter</h2>

<p>
A BuzzSaw filter is implemented as a Perl class using the Moose
Object-Oriented framework. It must implement
the <code>BuzzSaw::Filter</code> role and provide
a <code>check()</code> method. For example:
</p>

<p>
For every parsed log entry the <code>check()</code> method will be
called with the following arguments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A reference to a hash containing values for the elements
  described above.</li>
  <li>The current number of positive votes cast in favour of storing
  the event.</li>
  <li>A reference to an array which provides further details on the
  decisions reached earlier in the filter stack. Each element in the
  array is itself a reference to an array where the first element is
  the name of the filter and the second element is the value returned
  for the vote (see below for details).</li>
</ol>

<p>The method must return one of the following values:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>1 (one) - <strong><code>$BuzzSaw::Report::VOTE_KEEP</code></strong></dt>
  <dd>Positive vote in favour of having the event stored. Any tags returned will also be stored.</dd>
  <dt>0 (zero) - <strong><code>$BuzzSaw::Report::VOTE_NO_INTEREST</code></strong></dt>
  <dd>Negative vote, no interest in having the event stored. Any tags returned will be ignored.</dd>
  <dt>-1 (negative one) - <strong><code>$BuzzSaw::Report::VOTE_NEUTRAL</code></strong></dt>
  <dd>Neutral, go with the result of other filters in the stack. Any tags returned will be stored.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The first two options are fairly straightforward. The third may
seem a little peculiar but it becomes useful when you need to write a
filter which is designed to make decisions based on the results of
other filter modules which are placed earlier in the stack. For
example, the <code>BuzzSaw::Filter::UserClassifier</code> module will
classify the value of the <em>userid</em> field if it has been added
by a previous filter (e.g. SSH or Cosign) and extra information will
be associated with the event.</p>

<p>Optionally, a filter may also return a list of tags (simple
strings) which should be associated with this log entry when it is
stored.</p>

<p>Here is a particularly trivial first example which shows a filter
which will return true if the event has a value for
the <em>program</em> field and it matches the <code>kernel</code>
string.</p>

<pre>
package BuzzSaw::Filter::Kernel;
use Moose;

with 'BuzzSaw::Filter';

sub check {
  my ( $self, $event, $votes, $results ) = @_;

  return ( exists $event->{program} && $event->{program} eq 'kernel' );
}
</pre>

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>
Returning a list of tags is useful to aid later searching and
reporting. It is not obligatory but clearly it is going to be simpler
to write an SQL query which states &quot;<em>show me all events with
the 'authfail' tag</em>&quot; than it is to parse the various strings
(again) to search for SSH login events which contain particular error
messages. If nothing else this stores the results of the filter
process which avoids duplication of code and effort in two different
languages. The set of collected tags from all filters in the stack
which express an interest in the entry are uniqueified and stored in
the <code>tags</code> table in the database.
</p>

<p>Here is a slightly more involved version of the previous example
which shows how to add a simple tag (named <code>segfault</code>) when
the event message contains the word <code>segfault</code>.</p>

<pre>
package BuzzSaw::Filter::Kernel;
use Moose;

with 'BuzzSaw::Filter';

sub check {
  my ( $self, $event, $votes, $results ) = @_;

  my $accept = 0;
  my @tags;
  if ( exists $event->{program} && $event->{program} eq 'kernel' ) {
    push @tags, 'kernel';
    $accept = 1;

    if ( $event->{message} =~ m/segfault/o ) {
      push @tags, 'segfault';
    }
  }

  return ( $accept, @tags );
}
</pre>

<h3>Extra Information</h3>

<p>
As mentioned previously, it is also possible to attach extra
information to a log entry which is going to be stored. This is done
via the <code>extra_info</code> hash element, it is a reference to a
simple Perl hash of keys and string values. For example, the SSH
filter uses this approach to store the source address for each SSH
login event log entry. These keys and values will be stored in
the <code>extra_info</code> table in the database. Extra information
can be specified like this:
</p>

<pre>
$event->{extra_info}{source_address} = '10.0.0.0';
$event->{extra_info}{auth_method}    = 'password';
</pre>

<p>Note that for data protection reasons the stored log messages are
anonymised after a certain period of time. The tag data is assumed to
be safe and is all kept. Currently all other extra information is
considered to be risky and it is thus deleted when an event is
anonymised. So, don't rely on the extra information being available
for really long-term statistical analysis.

<h3>What to accept</h3>

<p>
It is very tempting, for the sake of speed and simplicity, to write a
filter which just declares an interest in every event with the correct
program string. In a few cases this might be the right thing to do but
more often it is better to do further filtering based on the message
to see if it really is of genuine interest. The design of BuzzSaw is
to only store events of real interest, filling the database with data
for events you will never subsequently examine adds in a lot more
noise to the stored data, makes processing and reporting take longer
and is generally rather pointless. For example, a typical syslog can
contain hundreds of varied entries related to the kernel most of which
are of little consequence. We are likely to only be interested in
serious issues such as panics, oops, out-of-memory conditions. It is
also worth noting that, in general, any program can insert a syslog
entry containing any information it likes so you should never
completely trust the data.
</p>

<h3>Performance Issues</h3>

<p>
If BuzzSaw is being used to process logs daily on a central server
then these filter methods could potentially be called hundreds of
thousands of times. Consequently, speed is of the essence, it is worth
spending a little time considering if you can achieve your goals with
simple string equality checks (e.g. <em>is the program string equal to
&quot;kernel&quot;</em>) rather than regular expressions. Where regular
expressions are required then it is best to use the <code>/o</code>
regular expression modifier to ensure it is only compiled once. It is
also well worth declaring the regular expressions globally using
the <code>qr</code> function. The SSH and Kernel filters which are
shipped as part of the BuzzSaw package are good guides to best
practice.
