  Use time_local() and time_gm() from Astro::Coord::ECI::Utils. This
    requires Astro::Coord::ECI::Utils 0.077.

    The problem here is that earlier in the year I found that Time::Local
    worked better for dates well away from the current year if I passed it
    the Gregorian year rather than computing the Perl year. But I support
    Time::y2038 for the benefit of older Perls, and it expects a Perl year.
    The fix was to wrap the Time::y2038 calls in code that duplicates
    Time::Local's year handling.

    Thanks to Slaven Rezic for finding this, and for having smokers
    configured with modules like Time::y2038 (which is optional for this
    package) so that he _could_ find it. Kudos!

  Support formatting times with any class conforming to the DateTime
    interface, via formatter attribute 'back_end'. If
    DateTime::Calendar::Christian is used her, require version 0.06.

  Support using DateTime (if available) to convert a parsed ISO-8601
    time to epoch. An arbitrary class confirming to the DateTime
    interface can be used instead, if specified.

  Support era indicators (AD/BC, CE/BCE) suffixed to year in the
    ISO-8601 time parser. Yes, this is an extension to the standard.

  Support parsing time with code (a code macro in the case of
    bin/satpass2).

  Add interactive method if(), which conditionally executes another
    interactive command. The conditional command can be 'begin', i.e. a
    block 'if'. Conditions include checks for operating systems, whether
    given objects are loaded, and Boolean tests on the values of
    environment variables and attributes.

  Implement block time() (with begin ... end). Like if(), this works
    only interactively.

  Except Template::Exception messages from the localization code.

  Try to warn if loading wrong-case module, if we think we might be on a

  Correctly handle tz attribute when the DateTime date formatter is in

  Fix bug in spacetrack -verbose search_oid and friends.

  Add -setup option to perl() method. This causes the arguments to be
    recorded and emitted by the save() method.

  More informative DateTime time zone error message.

  Rewrite object-specific formatter code to place dispatchers in the
    Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue name space rather than use
    AUTOLOAD().  The AUTOLOAD() implementation caused all sorts of
    smoker errors that I was unable to reproduce, and I was averse to
    blindly writing stubs for Perl-defined subroutines.

  Remove subroutine Astro::App::Satpass2::Utils::fold_case(). This is
    documented as private, but since is _was_ documented I decided to
    put it through an abbreviated deprecation cycle.

  Add add() method to Astro::App::Satpass2. This validates and adds TLE
    objects.

  Remove ::Format::Template::Provider from t/basic.t

  Fix test failures in t/locale.t

  Force stringification of Template::Exception.

  Have the tle_verbose template ignore non-TLE data.

  Fix bug in -choose foo,bar which caused only 'foo' to be chosen.

  Add real localization support. This addresses almost all text seen by
    the user, though I have not done a lot on error messages other than
    put in the calls. A very rough Spanish localization is provided in
    eg/.

  Generate format selection options for tle() based on available

  Drop Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Template::Provider.

  Refactor and rationalize formatter code.

  Add Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue::Formatter to implement custom

  Make use of the TLE illuminated() method To calculate illumination for

  Require Astro::Coord::ECI (etc) 0.063.

  Drop default template documentation, which was only intended for
    informational purposes. Instead, we document how to extract the
    default templates.

  Add support for magnitudes. This involves:

    * Add a pass_variant attribute so we can ask for the brightest
      moment in the pass.

    * Add a -brightest option to pass() to override pass_variant, so
      that the interface is at least semi-consistent.

    * Modify the value formatter's magnitude() formatter so that, if
      there is no {magnitude} key in the thing being formatted, but
      there is a magnitude() method on the body, that method is called
      and the result formatted.

    * Modify the template for pass() to check to see whether
      PASS_VARIANT_BRIGHTEST is set, and if so add a magnitude column to
      the report.

    The last point above required a number of supporting changes:

    - Add a want_pass_variant() convenience method to return true if the
      specific variant is wanted.

    - Pass the Astro::App::Satpass object as the sp variable to Template
      Toolkit from the pass() method (and other non- formatter()
      methods) so that the template can see if the brightest moment is
      being requested.

    - use [% UNLESS data %] instead of [% DEFAULT data = ... %] in all
      templates, since it appears that the latter evaluates the
      right-hand side of the expression even if it does not use the
      value. This essentially causes each template to do a default
      calculation (with possible errors) whose result is thrown away.

  Permit initialization with special files. The idea is to allow /dev/null.

  Document the pass_threshold attribute, which was introduced in version
    0.000_38 (2012-01-19!) but somehow not documented then.

  Use of the Astro::App::Satpass2 'lit' attribute now produces an error.

  Suppress errors on pass events which have a numeric value but no
    defined selector. The event is not reported.

0.018		2014-04-13	T. R. Wyant
  Eliminate use of each() built-in.

  Have 'magnitude' format effector call the magnitude() method if the

    magnitude_table().

  Bump Astro::Coord::ECI requirement to 0.062.

  Make the rounding of time for display configurable. The default is to

  Support body-specific pass events. This is really in support of a
    project to predict sounding rocket visibility based on published KMZ
    files for the launch.

  Add options to the quarters() method to select which are displayed.

  Add eg/quarters_vcalendar.

  In Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue:

  * Add formatter method list() to handle TLE output. Handle individual
      lines of the list with sub-templates.

  * Build time formats when used. This to allow subclasses to add time
      formatters.

  "Code macro" support tweaks. This is all still experimental:

  * Add method Astro::App::Satpass2->__add_to_observing_list().

  * Call code macro after_load() (if it exists) after loading the
      macros.

  * If a code macro is loaded using the -lib option, record the absolute
      path to the directory unless -relative also asserted.

  Fix Astro::App::Satpass2::Format::Dump. No telling how long it was

  Use a mock File::HomeDir object for testing.

  Have the expansion of ~~ throw an exception if the configuration
    directory does not exist. Skip test of ~~ expansion in this case.

  Improve tests that compare path to expected, to handle better the case
    where the path contains a symbolic link.

  Fixed failure in Astro::App::Satpass2::Format->decode(
    'desired_equinox_dynamical' ) when the value was not 0.

  In file name expansion, made ~~/... expand to configuration directory.

  Added the ability to implement a macro as Perl code. These are handled
    by Astro::App::Satpass2::Macro::Code. The corresponding satpass2
    syntax is 'macro load Module_name'. Document this in TUTORIAL.

  Updated required version of Astro::SpaceTrack to one that supports the
    REST interface.

  Require Astro::Coord::ECI 0.57 because of the international launch
    designator problems introduced in 0.051_01.

  Make load_package() optionally callable as a method so it can use the
    same error reporting mechanism as everyone else if it is available.

  Add options to the load_package() calling sequence: lib (which
    directory to add to @INC), complain (how to report validation
    failures), and fatal (whether and how to report failures to load the
    module). A true value of 'fatal' causes the failure not to be cached
    so that another load of the module will produce the same failure.

  Made $satpass2->time_parser( base => ... ) both parse an input time
    and return a formatted time.

  Made time parsing conform to the documentation in that if the time was
    defaulted, the default sets the base time for the parser.

  Implement Astro::App::Satpass2 method sky( lookup => ... ) in terms of
    the Astro::SIMBAD::Client script method rather than the query()
    method, since the former does not use SOAP::Lite.

  On failures in t/parse_time_date_manip_*.t, dump the zone of the
    parser object, if any.

  Require File::HomeDir 0.93, since we are using my_dist_config().

  Further tweak dumping of Date::Manip info in tests, in the hope of
    getting enough information to actually diagnose test failures.

  Eliminate warnings in t/parse_time_date_manip_5.t if Date::Manip v5 is
    being used (rather than Date::Manip 6's DM5 back end).

  Bypass Date::Manip::DM5 testing under MSWin32, since it fails and I
    can't figure out why.

  Put traps in t/parse_time_date_manip_5.t to try to figure out where
    the DM5 errors are coming from.

  Fix warning thrown when there is no configuration directory.

  Correct problem with configuring (and dumping the configuration of)
    the time parser. The formatter object was being accessed instead.
    This has apparantly been present since pretty much the beginning.

  Make the time_parser class of record
    Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip rather than ::v5 or
    ::v6, since we have no control over the environment variables in
    effect when we are launched, and thus, if Date::Manip 6 is
    installed, which back end is in use.

  Redo Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip logic so that if
    Date::Manip 6 is initialized in DM5 mode calls to it get routed
    through Astro::App::Satpass2::ParseTime::Date::Manip::v5. This was
    causing failures under Perl 5.8.

  Make 'input redirection' (<file) work, but more like `file`; that is,
    the contents of the file become a token at that point in the
    command.

  Make Astro::App::Satpass2::FormatValue more amenable to subclassing,
    though subclassing is still unsupported.

  Give Astro::App::Satpass2::Format a 'value_formatter' attribute to
    control what class (or object) is used for formatting values.
