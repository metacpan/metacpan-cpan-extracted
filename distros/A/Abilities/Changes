Revision history for Abilities

0.5       2013-05-03 20:56:51 Asia/Jerusalem
	[ BUGFIXES ]
	- Fixed all bugs introduced in versions 0.3 and 0.4 that made this
	  package unusable (see the UPGRADING FROM v0.2 sections in both
	  Abilities.pm and Abilities/Features.pm for more info)

0.4       2013-05-02 21:06:25 Asia/Jerusalem
	[ VARIOUS CHANGES ]
	- Moved from Any::Moose to Moo as per the former's deprecation

	[ BUGFIXES ]
	- fixed _build_abilities() to skip non-blessed roles (submitted by cafe01)
	- small documentation fixes

0.3       2012-12-28 17:15:01 Asia/Jerusalem
	[ BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY BROKEN ]
	- Actions and features can now have constraints. When an action/features
	  doesn't have any, then it's really a yes/no (have/don't) option.
	  When an action/feature does have constraints, then it's no longer
	  a yes/no option. This allows more finer grained control over
	  abilities.
	- The can_perform() method now can only take one action, not a list.
	  It now also takes an optional constraint. Same goes for has_feature().
	- The required actions() method in Abilities.pm and features() method
	  in Abilities/Features.pm now expects a different return structure,
	  read the docs for more info
	- Abilities::Scoped is removed since Abilities now provides the
	  same functionality with the new constraints paradigm

	[ VARIOUS CHANGES ]
	- Now using Any::Moose instead of Moose
	- Changed the names of Abilities::assigned_role() and Abilities::belongs_to()
	  (they were the same method) to Abilities::assigned_role() and
	  added a deprecation warning for the previous two
	- Changed the name of Abilities::does_role() to Abilities::does_role()
	  and added a deprecation warning to the previous one
	- Changed the name of Abilities::Features::inherits_plan()
	  to Abilities::Features::inherits_plan() and added a deprecation
	  warning for the previous one
	- Created a test suite

0.2       2011-02-01 19:16:06 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added Abilites::Scoped - a special version of Abilites.pm that
	  supports scoping
