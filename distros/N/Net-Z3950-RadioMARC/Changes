Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::RadioMARC.

0.07  Mon Nov 14 10:35:31 GMT 2005
	- Fix typo in documentation: the test() method's optional
	  "token" paremter was previously documented as "record".
	  Thanks to Jason Thomale <j.thomale@ttu.edu> for spotting and
	  reporting this.
	- Add META.yml to distribution.

0.06  Wed Apr 27 11:43:16 BST 2005
	- Add dependency on Net::Z3950::PQF to Makefile.PL.
	- RadioMARC.pm now explicitly requires version 0.03 or better
	  of the PQF parser, since the representation of term nodes
	  changed between 0.02 and 0.03.

0.05  Thu Mar  3 15:01:48 GMT 2005
	- IndexMARC.pm now uses Net::Z3950::PQF to support a larger
	  proportion of PQF.  In particular, truncation is now
	  supported: left, right, and left-and-right as well as none.
	  Also, simple booleans (AND, OR, NOT).  Does not yet
	  correctly merge word-position information, but that doesn't
	  matter much since the only use for that information is to
	  implement proximity, which we don't have or need.
	- New test-script, "t/03-truncation.t", for IndexMARC's
	  truncation support.
	- New test-script, "t/04-boolean.t", for IndexMARC's boolean
	  operator support.
	- No default output for tests that yield "notfound" status:
	  this case is now silent unless a message-template is set for
	  "notfound".
	- The IndexMARC module's add() method now returns an opaque
	  token representing the newly added record, which can be used
	  to retrieve the record with fetch().   The RadioMARC
	  module's add() method returns an array of the opaque tokens
	  returned to it when adding its records to the MARC index.
	- An opaque token returned from RadioMARC::add() may be passed
	  into test() as the "record" element of the argument hash to
	  specify which of the test-set records the query is intended
	  to match.
	- Added "etc/hrm2marc.pl" to the distribution, a simple script
	  that transforms a human-readable representation of a MARC
	  record into ISO 2709 format.
	- Much better example script, "bathtest.pl", tests a server's
	  compliance with the requirements of the Bath Profile.
	- Clarifications to the documentation, based on Bill Moen's
	  critique.
	- Guard against test-set records and retrieved records that
	  lack the identity field.  Similar care taken when comparing
	  subfield values.
	- Only log "found multiple records" if we have indeed done so!
	- Support multiple comma-separated candidate identity-field in
	  the "identityField" property.

0.04  Fri Dec 17 11:41:26 GMT 2004
	- Include a real sample radioactive MARC record.
	- Better example scripts that run against The Z-Interop server
	  at research.lis.unt.edu:2200/zinterop
	- Allow the "identifyField" property to identify a control
	  field (without subfield) as well as a subfield of a normal
	  field.
	- Honour the "delay" property.
	- Tokenisation rules in IndexMARC.pm changed so that ",", ".",
	  ":" and "/" are now all word-separators.
	- The distribution now includes an "examples" directory that
	  contains example scripts (and the records they need to check
	  against).
	- test() now returns just the status when called in scalar
	  context.
	- When a test succeeds, if no message is defined for the "ok"
	  status then there is no output at all.  Previously, the
	  output was "status='ok'" which made made it impossible to
	  write silent-if-successful test scripts.

0.03  Wed Dec  1 17:39:46 GMT 2004
	- New "identityField" property may be set to indicate a field
	  whose contents identify a record for purposes of comparison
	  to see whether an expected record is in a result set.
	- Better test-suite, including a rigorous work-out for the
	  utility IndexMARC module.
	- Many small corrections and clarifications in documentation.

0.02  Tue Nov 23 17:40:22 GMT 2004
	- First released version.

0.01  Sat Nov 20 00:04:43 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X Net::Z3950::RadioMARC


### Still to do:
	- Meaningful tests for the RadioMarc module itself
	- Recognise "non-diagnostic failures" such as timeouts
	- Skip tests against servers that are not even there
	- Maybe have IndexMARC.pm parse fields more cleverly
	- Link to an overview paper describing the approach
