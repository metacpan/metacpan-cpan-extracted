    - Use perlcritic and perltidy.
    - Test that adding a node in the server and reading its value
      from the client works.
    - Use an efficient way to export constants in Perl namespace.
    - Implement UA_Client_readValueAttribute().
    - Use a function jump table for packing all variant types.
    - Make this module run on multi threaded Perl by sprinkling dTHX
      into the XS file.
    - UA_DiscoveryConfiguration and UA_FilterOperand croak when
      trying to pack them.
    - Implement all missing packed functions for builtin types.
    - To test client and server easily, implement
      OPCUA::Open62541::Test::Server and OPCUA::Open62541::Test::Client
      to handle the other end.
