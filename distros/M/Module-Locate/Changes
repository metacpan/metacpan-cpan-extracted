Revision history for Perl extension Module::Locate

1.80 2015-10-25 NEILB
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla
    - Updated github repo URL after changing my github username

1.79 2014-04-01
    - Don't muck with %INC RT#30523.
    - Get directory separator handling right(er).

1.78_01 2014-03-31
    - mod_to_path() now always uses '/' as directory separator;
      this problem was noted by DAGOLDEN in RT#30523. Added a small
      testsuite for mod_to_path(), so that CPAN Testers can confirm
      correct behaviour on Windows.
    - Removed the Global and Cache options. Checked all the dists using
      this module on CPAN. Only one was using Global, but not relying on
      the odd quirk of that. Hence the developer release first.
    - Sorted out the confusion between when to use '/' and when not,
      in locate().

1.78 2013-12-16
    - Added MIN_PERL_VERSION to Makefile.PL, as previous attempt
      to add min perl version to metadata failed. I really should
      switch all my dists to Dist::Zilla!

1.77 2013-12-15
    - Added 'use 5.8.8' to specify minimum version of Perl.
      This should give Module-Locate a clean bill of health on CPANTS
    - Added 'warnings' as a prereq in Makefile.PL

1.76 2013-08-15
    - Added in "use warnings" after looking at CPANTS

1.75 2013-08-14
    - Fixed an operator precedence bug in is_mod_loaded()
      RT#87204: report and fix from Reini Urban

1.74 2013-07-20
    - Added license metadata to Makefile.PL and to the pod

1.73 2013-07-20
    - Fixed up dates in this file to satisfy CPAN::Changes::Spec
    - Removed version number from README
    - Made the repository URL in the pod a link

1.72 2012-09-24
    - Updated SEE ALSO to include link to review of modules
      for getting the path of a module.

1.71 2012-09-17
    - Added github repository to documentation
    - Updated Makefile.PL with prereqs and github repository info
    - Updated this file to follow conventions in CPAN::Changes::Spec
    - minor updates to documentation to improve clarity
    - added App::Module::Locate to SEE ALSO
    - first release by NEILB (thanks to Dan for co-maint)

1.7 2005-07-02
    - "locate" now also accepts filenames
    - added "mod_to_path" function
    - dropped Module::Build and warnings dependencies
    - dropped Changes section from module POD

1.6 2005-05-19
    - fixed failing Win32 tests (thanks barbie!)

1.5 2004-01-07
    - added the ubiquitous "Makefile.PL" (thanks "Module::Build"!)

1.4 2003-12-15
    - now backward compatible with 5.00503

1.3 2003-11-25
    - Tidied up POD.
    - "acks_like_fh()" now tests plain globs i.e "*FH"

1.2 2003-11-25
    - No longer "croak()"s when "locate()" fails to find the module (which is
      much nicer and is consistent with the documentation).
    - "Build.PL" should now play nice with "CPAN" installs

1.1 2003-11-07
    - fixed "$PkgRe" to be functional
    - added "is_mod_loaded()" and "is_pkg_loaded()" functions
    - added ':all' "import()" option
    - hopefully fixed b0rken CPAN make process ...
