NAME

    Dist::Zooky - converts a distribution to Dist::Zilla

VERSION

    version 0.24

SYNOPSIS

      use Dist::Zooky;
    
      my $dzooky = Dist::Zooky->new();
    
      $dzooky->examine;

DESCRIPTION

    Dist::Zooky is Dist::Zilla's nephew. He has the ability to summon his
    uncle.

    It will try its best to convert a distribution to use Dist::Zilla. It
    supports ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Install and Module::Build based
    distributions, with certain limitations.

    The main documentation for this is under dzooky.

 METHODS

    examine

      This does all the heavy-lifting of determining if a distribution is
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Install and Module::Build based, gathers
      meta data and generates a dist.ini.
