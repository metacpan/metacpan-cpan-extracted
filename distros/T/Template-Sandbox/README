Template-Sandbox

Template::Sandbox is Yet Another Templating module, designed primarily
for use in a webserver environment but usable anywhere, providing a more
secure "sandboxed" environment than most templating systems.

The core design philosiphy for Template::Sandbox is that the template
logic should have no access outside the template beyond that which you
choose to permit it, this is frequently known as sandboxing.

Unlike many other template systems, available on CPAN or in other languages,
Template::Sandbox doesn't give the template access to the global variables
of your application or to the core functions of the language.

This means that your template authors only have access to the data and
functionality that your application developers choose to grant them,
this encourages both to work with "published" interfaces between the
two systems - your template authors can't reach into the application's
internal-only data, and so your application developers can change that
internal data without worrying that the templates will stop working or
expose confidential information.

Template::Sandbox also provides the usual gamut of behaviours and
optional features: caching compiled templates, includes, flow control,
embedded expressions, cascading template candidates, and useful
debugging information in case of errors.

Furthermore, Template::Sandbox is designed to be subclassable should
you wish to customize or extend other of its features.
