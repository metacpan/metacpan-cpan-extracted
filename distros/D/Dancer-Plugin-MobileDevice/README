Dancer::Plugin::MobileDevice README

SYNOPSIS
        package MyWebApp;
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::MobileDevice;

        get '/' => sub {
            if (is_mobile_device) {
                # do something for mobile
            }
            else {
                # do something for regular agents
            }
        };

DESCRIPTION
    A plugin for Dancer-powered webapps to easily detect mobile clients and
    offer a simplified layout, and/or act in different ways.

    The plugin offers a `is_mobile_device' keyword, which returns true if
    the device is recognised as a mobile device.

    It can also automatically change the layout used to render views for
    mobile clients.

Custom layout for mobile devices
    This plugin can use a custom layout for recognised mobile devices,
    allowing you to present a simplified page template for mobile devices.
    To enable this, use the `mobile_layout' setting for this plugin - for
    instance, add the following to your config file:

      plugins:
        mobiledevice:
          mobile_layout: 'mobile'

    This means that, when `template' is called to render a view, if the
    client is recognised as a mobile device, the layout named `mobile' will
    be used, rather than whatever the current `layout' setting is.

    You can of course still override this layout by supplying a layout
    option to the `template' call in the usual way (see the Dancer
    documentation for how to do this).
