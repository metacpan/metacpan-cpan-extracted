NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Refs - Work with refs

VERSION
    version 0.002000

SYNOPSIS
    After doing lots of work with Git::Wrapper, I found there's quite a few
    ways to work with refs, and those ways aren't exactly all equal, or
    supported on all versions of git.

    This abstracts it so things can just use them.

        my $refs = Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Refs->new( zilla => $self->zilla );

        $refs->refs(); # A ::Ref object for each entry from `git ls-remote .`

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/**'); # the same thing

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/heads/**'); # all branches

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/tags/**'); # all tags

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/remotes/**'); # all remote branches

    Note: You probably shouldn't use this module directly, and should
    instead use one of the "::Util::Git" family.

METHODS
  "refs"
    Lists all "refs" in the "refs/" "namespace".

        my (@refs) = $reffer->refs();

    Shorthand for

        my (@refs) = $reffer->get_ref('refs/**');

  "get_ref"
    Fetch a given "ref", or collection of "ref"s, matching a specification.

        my ($ref) = $reffer->get_ref('refs/heads/master');
        my (@branches) = $reffer->get_ref('refs/heads/**');
        my (@tags)   = $reffer->get_ref('refs/tags/**');

    Though reminder, if you're working with branches or tags, use the
    relevant modules =).
