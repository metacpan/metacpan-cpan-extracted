=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::RFXCOM - Perl modules for RFXCOM RF receivers/transmitters with AnyEvent

=head1 VERSION

version 1.142240

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # see AnyEvent::RFXCOM::RX (and corresponding example script
  # rfxcom-anyevent-rx) and see Device::RFXCOM::TX (and example script
  # rfxcom-anyevent-tx)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AnyEvent modules to support RF receivers and transmitters produced by
RFXCOM, L<http://www.rfxcom.com/>.  This code is derived from code
written for the xPL-Perl project at L<http://www.xpl-perl.org.uk/>.

A bonus module is provided to support W800 RF receivers from
L<http://www.wgldesigns.com/>.  These receivers recognize fewer RF
protocols.

These devices are typically used for home automation and sensor
monitoring applications.

=head1 THANKS

Special thanks to RFXCOM, L<http://www.rfxcom.com/>, for their
excellent documentation and for giving me permission to use it to help
me write this code.  I own a number of their products and highly
recommend them.
