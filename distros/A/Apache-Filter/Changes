Version: 1.024  Sat Sep 24 21:56:42 CDT 2005

 - Fixed a bug that probably only I would ever see - when running the
   "disttest" action, it was actually using the server configuration
   from the top-level distribution directory, not the dist-dir
   directory.

 - For some reason all the files in the tarball of 1.023 looks like
   they're read-only and non-executable, which causes lots of tests to
   fail (e.g. those trying to execute CGI-style scripts).  I'm
   re-releasing what looks like correct permissions. [Spotted by Tom
   Kirkpatrick]

Version: 1.023  Mon Jun  6 06:05:44 CDT 2005

 - Fixed a testing bug under (certain versions of?) Mac OS X, in which
   none of the pages in t/real.t would generate any output. [Peter
   Farmer]

Version: 1.022  Fri Jan 31 14:00:48 CST 2003

 - Now can be installed using either Module::Build or
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  

 - Simplified a few of the TIEHANDLE code chunks that used substr() to
   manipulate saved filehandle data.

Version: 1.021   Fri Dec 27 10:13:23 CST 2002

 - The test suite now provides a bit more useful information upon
   failure and uses Test.pm to generate its output.

 - Avoid an "undefined value" warning in READLINE() method [Dave
   Rolsky]

 - If the initial $r isn't an Apache object (could be Apache::Request
   or a subclass of Apache), make an on-the-fly subclass of whatever
   it is. [Dave Rolsky]

Version: 1.020  Date: Mon Nov 11 17:11:31 AEST 2002
   Fixed the Apache::PerlRunFilter module, which was missing a call to
   filter_register(). [Ruslan U. Zakirov, Oleh Khoma]

   Minor regex speedup in READLINE() method of filehandle.

   Correct doc bug about Filter2 and Filter3.

   Add Apache::HTML::ClassParser to list of filter-aware modules.


Version: 1.019  Date: 2001/08/29 13:48:56
   Added a FILENO stub, which fixes a compatibility problem with
   Apache::Compress.
   
   Moved the Apache::Compress-related tests into their own subtest, so it
   can be skipped if the user doesn't have Apache::Compress installed.
   
   'Changes' file isn't auto-generated from CVS anymore.


Version: 1.018  Date: 2001/04/08 07:30:13
   Some fixes for the 'perl Makefile.PL' and 'make test' stages.  Fixes a
   problem for those who want to skip testing with a real httpd, and
   properly removes quotation marks from 'LoadModule' directives when
   building httpd.conf to use during 'make test'.
   
   No changes were made to the actual Apache::Filter code, just stuff in
   the test suite.


Version: 1.017  Date: 2001/04/06 21:34:28
   Fixed a filehandle bug in which send_fd() would complain about a 'Bad
   filehandle'.  Occurred most often with Apache::Compress.
   
   Added a couple of tests to properly exercise the send_fd() method.


Version: 1.016  Date: 2000/12/20 03:43:44
   Noted dependency on mod_perl 1.24_01.


Version: 1.015  Date: 2000/12/20 03:01:57
   Fixed a bug in Apache::RegistryFilter that caused a crash when
   handler() was called as a function instead of a method.
   [thumper@bsi.menlo-park.ca.us]


Version: 1.014  Date: 2000/11/06 20:41:00
   Previous filters can set content-type via
   $r->send_http_header('text/blah'), and the value they set will be used
   as the default for subsequent filters.  [gyoung@laserlink.net (Geoffrey Young)]
   
   Content-length wasn't being set correctly in send_http_header().  Fixed.
   
   My patches to Apache::PerlRun, Apache::RegistryBB, and
   Apache::RegistryNG have been applied to the main mod_perl source tree,
   so I'm no longer distributing them with Apache::Filter.


Version: 1.013  Date: 2000/11/05 04:37:10
   Cleaned up new implementation begun in 1.012.  Revised documentation
   accordingly.
   
   Added overloaded method for $r->print().


Version: 1.012  Date: 2000/09/07 05:17:27
   (not released publically)
   
   Major reorganization of code in Apache::Filter.  Now Apache::Filter is
   a subclass of Apache, which allows much smoother overriding of the
   functionality that needs to be changed for filtering.  In particular,
   send_http_headers() and send_fd() behave well now.
   
   Added new filter_register() method, which must always be called.
   filter_input() isn't necessary anymore when you don't actually need
   the input filehandle it returns.


Version: 1.011  Date: 2000/06/24 23:38:21
   Fixed a bug in which Apache::RegistryFilter wasn't properly
   registering itself with Apache::Filter on the 2nd, 3rd, etc. times a
   script gets run.  tbrown@baremetal.com (Tom Brown) found the bug.
   
   Fixed the POD in Apache::RegistryFilter, which was slightly malformed.
   gyoung@laserlink.net (Geoffrey Young) found it.
   
   During 'make test', the error log won't be removed, so you can examine
   it even if there were no failures.


Version: 1.010  Date: 2000/06/17 18:26:05
   Apache::RegistryFilter now overrides Apache's header-sending routines
   with no-ops, so that you may leave header-sending calls in your
   Registry scripts.  This means you can use the same code under
   Apache::Registry and Apache::RegistryFilter.
   
   Added a test to make sure the above header-overriding works properly.
   
   Added lots of insane crap to the 'make test' phase to support apaches
   built with --enable-shared=max or any DSOs.  [caelum@debian.org
   (Rafael Kitover)]
   
   During 'perl Makefile.PL', search around for copies of apache to use
   during 'make test'.  Also default to user 'nobody' if the current user
   is root.  [caelum@debian.org (Rafael Kitover)]
   
   Added Apache::SimpleReplace to list of Filter-aware handlers.
   [gyoung@laserlink.net (Geoffrey Young)]
   
   Changed <\Files> to </Files> in documentation. [sbekman@stason.org (Stas Bekman)]


Version: 1.009  Date: 2000/05/27 14:00:58
   Added the Apache::Final class, which catches the first output that the
   last filter in the chain attempts to send to the browser.  We then
   send the proper headers and immediately step out of the way, putting a
   direct connection between the browser and the code sending the data.
   [gyoung@laserlink.net (Geoffrey Young)]
   
   Sped up the PRINT method a little bit by eliminating a temporary
   variable.
   
   Removed a superfluous semicolon in the documentation.
   [sbekman@stason.org (Stas Bekman)]


Version: 1.008  Date: 2000/04/13 00:53:53
   Added the Apache::RegistryFilter module, which provides support for
   Registry scripts in a Filter chain.
   
   Fixed up the Makefile.PL file a bit.


Version: 1.007  Date: 2000/03/24 15:03:14
   Changed several $r->filename instances to $r->finfo.  This will speed
   up operation.  I did this once in the past, but had to change it back
   to $r->filename because $r->finfo wasn't working right.  mod_perl
   version 1.18 claims to have fixed the problems, so I'm changing it
   forth again.
   
   Fixed a run-time server error that occurs when the input filename
   doesn't exist.  [gyoung@laserlink.net (Geoffrey Young)]


Version: 1.006  Date: 2000/01/29 17:54:44
   Added 'handle' parameter to filter_input().
   [Vegard.Vesterheim@runit.sintef.no (Vegard Vesterheim)]
   
   If $r->filename can't be opened, we no longer abort halfway through
   filter_input().  Just return an undef filehandle at the end.
   [gozer@hbesoftware.com (Philippe M. Chiasson)]


Version: 1.005  Date: 1999/10/17 15:59:23
   No changes - version bump to update the README file.


Version: 1.004  Date: 1999/10/17 15:47:27
   Fixed a problem that prevented proper functioning when Perl is
   compiled with sfio instead of stdio.  Should work properly now.


Version: 1.003  Date: 1999/09/12 03:25:45
   Forgot to replace Doug's PerlRun documentation with my
   PerlRunFilter documentation in the last release, so I did it now.


Version: 1.002  Date: 1999/09/12 02:22:47
   Added $VERSION stuff to integrate with CVS.


Version: 1.001  Date: 1999/09/12 02:17:10
   Added files to CVS
