NAME
    Date::Period::Human - Human readable date periods

SYNOPSYS
        # Create the Date::Period::Human object
        my $d = Date::Period::Human->new();

        # Get a relative human readable date string
        my $s = $d->human_readable('2010-01-01 02:30:42');

        # Now $s contains the relative date

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a string of relative time. This is useful when you're showing
    user created content, where it's nicer to show how long ago the item was
    posted instead of the date and time.

    This also solves the problem where you don't know the timezone of the
    user who is viewing the item. This is solved because you show relative
    time instead of absolute time in most cases.

    There is one case that isn't relative.

CLASS METHODS
    This class contains one public class method.

  new [options]
    lang
        The language you want to use. Default 'nl', can be 'en' for English.

    today_and_now
        An arrayref containing [ $year, $month, $day, $hour, $min, $sec ].

        Will be used as the fixed point from which the relative time will be
        calculated.

METHODS
    This class contains one public method.

  $self->human_readable($mysql_date|$datetime|$epoch)
    Parses the $mysql_date and returns a human readable time string.

    Or, $datetime (a DateTime object) and returns a human readable time
    string.

    Or, $epoch (identified by regex /^\d+$/) and passed through gmtime().
