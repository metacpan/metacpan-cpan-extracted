=head1 NAME

minicpan_webserver - run a CPAN::Mini web server on the command line

=head1 VERSION

version 0.58

=head1 SYNOPSIS

First you must install CPAN::Mini and create a local copy of CPAN using
minicpan. Then you may run minicpan_webserver and search and browse Mini CPAN at
http://localhost:2963/. The listening port can be configured with C<--port>
command line option.

  % minicpan_webserver
  % minicpan_webserver --port 8090

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program provides a web server that allows you to search and browse Mini
CPAN.

=head1 MINICPAN CONFIGURATION

=head2 Real Author Names

CPAN::Mini::Webserver can optionally return the real names of authors
instead of an ascii representation of them. This depends on the file
'authors/00whois.xml' being mirrored from CPAN. CPAN::Mini doesn't do
this by default. You can tell it to mirror this file by putting the
following line in your .minicpanrc:

  also_mirror: authors/00whois.xml

=head2 Cache Directory

CPAN::Mini::Webserver uses L<App::Cache> internally to cache index data about
the cpan mirror. The directory it defaults to is inside the user's home dir,
but by adding this to .minicpanrc it can be configured:

  cache_dir: /tmp/your/cache/dir

=head2 Full-Text Indexing

CPAN::Mini::Webserver normally only indexes author, module and distribution
names for its search, but it can be configured to inspect the tarballs in the
cpan mirror and do a full-text index of the POD inside them. Naturally this is
not advised for big mirrors as it is very memory-intensive. It can be enabled by
adding this to .minicpanrc:

  full_text: 1

=head3 Subroutine Indexing

When full text indexing is enabled, indexing of subroutines via PPI can be
enabled additionally. This will add a checkbox to the search field, restricting
the autocomplete, as well as search results to subs found in packages. It can
be enabled by adding this to .minicpanrc:

  index_subs: 1

=head2 Side Bar With All Packages

On smaller mirrors it can be useful to have a side bar with all present
packages on the left. This can be enabled by adding the following to
.minicpanrc:

  side_bar: 1

=head2 Base Url

Sometimes it is desirable to host CMW not at an url root, but at an arbitrary
path inside it. For that purpose a base_url parameter can be set in in
.minicpanrc to any string that will be prepended to all urls inside the
application (a trailing / is expected, but not enforced):

  base_url: /v2/cgi-bin/docs/server.cgi/

=head2 Doc Mode

Sometimes it can be desirable to have CMW display only POD documentation and not
the underlying code. This can be achieved by setting the doc_mode parameter in
.minicpanrc:

  doc_mode: 1
