=Preface

These are just \I<ideas>. Possibly not everything in this list
will be implemented, and probably these notes do not describe
all features which might be on the way ;-). Further ideas are welcome.

If you you like an idea especially, please let us now to accelerate
implementation if possible. If you like it so much that you want to
implement it yourself, this might be possible - please contact us.


=General

* Bodyless macro call before a new chapter inserts an additional headline (delayed "=")
  when the macro opens an included file and produces additional paragraphs.

* add tests for the \C<_cnd>_ option (both for generic tags declared by modules and the builtin
  ones like \C<\\INCLUDE>, \C<\\EMBED> and \C<\\TABLE>)

* publish a collection of example filters

* publish a collection of example code

* improve the SourceForge project homepage, include areas for user provides macros, filters,
  code, examples etc.

* The Emacs 19.x lisp file does not work under Emacs 21.x. I made a workaround, but it
  still produces an error message. Check if it still works with older Emacs versions, and
  try to remove the error message.


=pp2pod

* complete? (may be sufficient enough as a demonstration ...)

* apply interface to pp2sdf;


=pp2pp

* find out why a first transformation of this TODO file
  differs from subsequent ones by a trailing whitespace;

* complete target mode 3;

* implement target modes 2 and 1;

* apply interface to pp2sdf;


=pp2sdf

* add index (based on \\INDEX);

* add documentation in PerlPoint format;

* include tests;


=Parser: Cache

* old cache typically delays processing (with lots of dynamisation), remove it

* implement a new file based cache, store

>

* stat() data

* path

* entry checksums for all dynamic parts: macros, code, variables, filters, ... (read exception list in old cache doc)

* stream

* updated dynamic parts if they changed (new macros, filters, ... etc.)

<

* exclude

>

* files using \\INCLUDE (ooops!) - this means that only leaves are cached - or can we split up files automatically, virtually building container
  documents?
