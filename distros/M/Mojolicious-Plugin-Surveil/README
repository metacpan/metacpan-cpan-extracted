NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Surveil - Surveil user actions

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Surveil is a plugin which allow you to see every
    event a user trigger on your web page. It is meant as a debug tool for
    seeing events, even if the browser does not have a JavaScript console.

    Note: With great power, comes great responsibility.

    CAVEAT: The JavaScript that is injected require WebSocket in the browser
    to run. The surveil events are attached to the "body" element, so any
    other event that prevent events from bubbling will not emit this to the
    WebSocket resource.

SYNOPSIS
    Use default logging:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;
      plugin "surveil";
      app->start;

    Use custom route:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;
      use Mojo::JSON "j";

      plugin surveil => { path => "/surveil" };

      websocket "/surveil" => sub {
        my $c = shift;

        $c->on(message => sub {
          my ($c, $action) = @_;
          warn "User event: $action\n";
        });
      };

      app->start;

CONFIG
    This plugin can take the following config params:

    *   enable_param = "..."

        Used to specify a query parameter to be part of the URL to enable
        surveil.

        Default is not to require any query parameter.

    *   events = [...]

        The events that should be reported back over the WebSocket.

        Defaults to click, touchstart, touchcancel and touchend. (The
        default list is EXPERIMENTAL).

    *   path = "...";

        The path to the WebSocket route.

        Defaults to "/mojolicious/plugin/surveil". Emitting the "path"
        parameter will also add a default WebSocket route which simply log
        with "debug" the action that was taken. (The format of the logging
        is EXPERIMENTAL)

METHODS
  register
      $self->register($app, $config);

    Used to add an "after_render" hook into the application which adds a
    JavaScript to every HTML document.
