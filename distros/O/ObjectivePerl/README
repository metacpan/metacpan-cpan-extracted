ObjectivePerl version 0.04
==========================
Changes in version 0.04:
* Fixed the commenting-out bug
* Fixed the docs to explain message-passing
  correctly (since the new CamelBones compatibility
  mode added a new message-signature test)

Changes in version 0.03:
* Added a debug mode with flags to allow debugging
  of messaging and/or source filtering
* Added CamelBones compatibility
* Added return types and argument types (optional, but required
  for CamelBones compatibility)
* Fixed many parsing and messaging bugs

ObjectivePerl version 0.01
==========================

ObjectivePerl is an extension to perl (written entirely
in perl) that allows programmers to use a variant of
Objective-C syntax in perl modules.  It allows:
* very clean class definitions
* true instance variables
* advanced message signatures and argument passing
* instance/class method specification
If you're not interested in any of those things, don't
use ObjectivePerl!  But if you are, go right ahead...
