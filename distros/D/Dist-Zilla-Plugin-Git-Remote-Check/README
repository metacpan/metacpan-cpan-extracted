PARAMETERS
  "remote_name"
    The name of the repository to use as specified in ".git/config".

    Defaults to "origin", which is usually what you want.

  "remote_branch"
    The branch name on the remote.

    e.g.: For "origin/master" use "master" with "remote_name = origin"

    Defaults to the same value as "branch"

  "do_update"
    A boolean value that specifies whether or not to execute the update.

    Default value is 1 / true.

  "branch"
    The local branch to check against the remote one. Defaults to 'master'

  "report_commits"
    In the event the remote is ahead, this "Int" dictates the maximum number
    of commits to print to output.

    Defaults to 5

METHODS
  "before_release"
    Executes code before releasing.

    1.  Updates the "remote" via "remote_update" in
        Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::Remote::Update

    2.  Checks the "remote" via "check_remote" in
        Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::Remote::Check

  "git"
    Returns a Git::Wrapper instance for the current Dist::Zilla projects
    "git" Repository.

  "remote"
    Returns a validated remote name. Configured via "remote_name" parameter.

  "remote_branch"
    Returns a fully qualified branch name for the parameter specified as
    "remote_branch" by combining it with "remote", and defaulting to the
    value of "branch" if not assigned explicitly.

  "remote_update"
    Performs "git remote update $remote_name" on "git" for the remote
    "remote"

  "branch"
    The local branch to check against the remote one. Defaults to 'master'

  "check_remote"
    Compare "branch" and "remote_branch" making sure that "branch" is the
    more recent of the 2.

ROLES
  "Dist::Zilla::Role::BeforeRelease"
    Causes this plugin to be executed during Dist::Zilla's "Before Re,ease"
    phase. ( "before_release" )

  "Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::LocalRepository"
    Provides a "git" method that returns a "Git::Wrapper" instance for the
    current "Dist::Zilla" project.

  "Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::Remote"
    Provides a "remote" method which always returns a validated "remote"
    name, optionally accepting it being specified manually to something
    other than "origin" via the parameter "remote_name"

  "Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::Remote::Branch"
    Provides a "remote_branch" method which combines the value returned by
    "remote" with a user specified branch name and returns a fully qualified
    remote branch name.

  "Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::Remote::Update"
    Provides a "remote_update" method which updates a "remote" in "git"

  "Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::Remote::Check"
    Provides "check_remote" which compares "branch" and "remote_branch" and
    asserts "remote_branch" is not ahead of "branch"
