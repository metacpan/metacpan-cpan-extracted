1.001002 2016-05-01T00:22:36Z edbd3ac
 - Added MetaConfig data to consumers.
 - This however requires a TRIAL releases, as this change module requires ::Plugin to already be composed in, but our
   tests and documentation unfortunately instructed users to compose it in *before* that, leading to a breakage.

1.001000 2014-07-29T09:21:17Z
 [00 Major]
 - ::Dir has new 'keepalive' method to mark/unmark scratch dirs for destruction.
 - ::Dir nas new 'keepalive_fail' method to trigger a croak, keep the temporary directory, and tell the user where to
   find it.
 - ::Dir::run_in()  and thus, ::Role::Tempdir::capture_tempdir(), now pass the Dir object itself as $_[0] for easy
   access.
 - ::Dir now generates tempdirs with the prefix "DZ_R_Tempdir_" for easy cleanup if tempdirs are left around.
 - ::Dir now supports property '_tempdir_owner' which will be normalised and included in the tempdir prefix if
   specified.
 - ::Role::Tempdir::capture_tempdir) now automatically passes the name of the consuming plugin as "_tempdir_owner",
   giving consuming plugins clear tempdir locations when things fail.

 [00 Major]
 - DZil Encoding support added.
 - Internals overhauled to use newer things.
 - Tooling overhauls
 - Version Scheme overhauls

 [01 Minor backwards incompatible API change]
 - Accessing $item->{name} is now gone entirely, use $item->name instead.
 - $item->{state} may also vanish in the near future, stop using it.

 [02 Dzil Encoding Support]
 - Should now be compatible with DZil 5, and reading files from a tempdir will now default to reading their content as
   "encoded_content" to an InMemory object.

 [03 Path/IO Replaced]
 - Usage of Path::Class and File::Slurp have both been eliminated and replaced by Path::Tiny
 - File::Find::Rule is replaced with Path::Iterator::Rule
 - File::Tempdir usage eliminated in favour of custom + Path::Tiny

 [04 Toolkit moved to EUMM]
 - Toolkit is now EUMM instead of Module::Build
 - Toolkit upgrade dependencies now prefer "latest" via "recommends", instead of "requires"

 [05 Version Scheme change]
 - Mantissa length has shortened to 6
 - Version semantics are now X.YYYZZZ
 - This is the primary motivation for the 1.x on the box.

 [Bugfixes]
 - No longer does any ->isa checking for digest modules. This closes #1
