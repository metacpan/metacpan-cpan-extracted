NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::HTCompiled - Integrate with
    HTML::Template::Compiled

SYNOPSIS
        # In your CGI::Application-derived base class. . . 
        use base "CGI::Application";
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::HTCompiled;

        # Later, in a run mode far, far away. . . 
        sub view
        {
            my $self = shift;
            my $username = $self->query->param("user");
            my $user     = My::Users->retrieve($username);

            my $tmpl_view = $self->load_tmpl( "view_user.tmpl" );

            $tmpl_view->param( user => $user );

            return $tmpl_view->output();
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Allows you to use HTML::Template::Compiled as a seamless replacement for
    HTML::Template.

DEFAULT PARAMETERS
    By default, the HTCompiled plugin will automatically add a parameter 'c'
    to the template that will return to your CGI::Application object $self.
    This allows you to access any methods in your CGI::Application module
    that you could normally call on $self from within your template. This
    allows for some powerful actions in your templates. For example, your
    templates will be able to access query parameters, or if you use the
    CGI::Application::Plugin::Session module, you can access session
    parameters.

     <a href="<tmpl_var c.query.self_url>">Reload this page</a>

    With this extra flexibility comes some responsibilty as well. It could
    lead down a dangerous path if you start making alterations to your
    object from within the template. For example you could call c.header_add
    to add new outgoing headers, but that is something that should be left
    in your code, not in your template. Try to limit yourself to pulling in
    information into your templates (like the session example above does).

  Extending load_tmpl()
    There are times when the basic "load_tmpl()" functionality just isn't
    enough. The easiest way to do this is by replacing or extending the
    functionality of CGI::Application's "load_tmpl()" method. This is still
    possible using the plugin.

    The following code snippet illustrates one possible way of achieving
    this:

      sub load_tmpl
      {
          my ($self, $tmpl_file, @extra_params) = @_;

          push @extra_params, "cache",             "1";
          return $self->SUPER::load_tmpl($tmpl_file, @extra_params);
      }

FUNCTIONS
    This is documentation of how it is done internally. If you actually are
    looking for how to use this module, see SYNOPSIS. There isn't anything
    else to do than using this plugin.

  import()
    Will be called when your Module uses HTML::Template::Compiled. Registers
    callbacks at the "init" and the "load_tmpl" stages. This is how the
    plugin mechanism works.

  _pass_in_self()
    Adds the parameter c each template that will be processed. See DEFAULT
    PARAMETERS for more information.

  _add_init()
    Set html_tmpl_class to HTML::Template::Compiled at the init stage. That
    way, each time a template is loaded using load_tmpl, an instance of
    HTML::Template::Compiled will be created instead of the defualt
    HTML::Template. See the CGI::Appliaction manpage for more information.

  load_tmpl()
    This method exists to ensure backward compatibility only. It overrides
    CGI::Application's load_tmpl() when this plugin is used the old way. See
    BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY for more information and please just don't use it
    that way anymore.

    For the most part, this is the exact "load_tmpl()" method from
    CGI::Application, except it uses HTML::Template::Compiled instead of
    HTML::Template.

    See the CGI::Application reference for more detailed information on what
    parameters can be passed to "load_tmpl()".

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
    You can still use the old method using the module by inheriting from it.
    This is not recommended, as it overrides CGI::Application's
    "load_tmpl()".

        # In your CGI::Application-derived base class. . . 
        use base ("CGI::Application::Plugin::HTCompiled", "CGI::Application");

        # Later, in a run mode far, far away. . . 
        sub view
        {
            my $self = shift;
            my $username = $self->query->param("user");
            my $user     = My::Users->retrieve($username);

            my $tmpl_view = $self->load_tmpl( "view_user.tmpl" );

            $tmpl_view->param( user => $user );

            return $tmpl_view->output();
        }

EXAMPLE
    Define your CGI::Application derived base class.

            package CGIApplicationDerivedBaseClass;
        
            use strict;

            use FindBin qw/$Bin/;
            use lib $Bin . '/lib';
        
            use base qw/CGI::Application/;
        
            use CGI::Application::Plugin::HTCompiled;
