          MAJOR REFACTORING OF GUTS
          If you run Email::MIME, you MUST be running Email::MIME 1.857 or
            better.
          require Email::MIME 1.857 in Makefile.PL only if an older
            version is already installed
          boldly moving forward with refactored headers and
            Email::Simple:::Header
          greatly reduce memory footprint
          add crlf method to allow other modules to avoid ->{mycrlf}
          fix broken header-junk test

1.996    2006-11-27
  - do not wrap Content-Type field; it can cause Outlook to go nuts
    while this is a special case, it does not make E::S incorrect, as folding
    long headers is allowed (for aesthetics) and not mandated

1.995    2006-10-19
  - tentative refactoring of headers

1.992    2006-10-05

  - fix a number of bugs when setting multiple headers, which would often
    refuse to set more values than were currently present
  - added a test for prepending (rather than appending) headers; while E::S
    does not yet support this, the header behavior will be easier to replace in
    future versions, and this is a forward-looking test

1.990    2006-09-05

  - ->header('foo') returns false if there is no foo header (formerly '')
  - croak if an undef value is passed to new()

1.980    2006-08-17

  - fix _fold() to add a missing line ending [RT #20764] (Brian Cassidy)

1.970    2006-08-17

  - bring ->headers method into Email::Simple
  - ->header_names and ->header_pairs

1.96    2006-07-28

  - output headers in predictable order
  - give tests more meaningful names
  - improved test coverage

1.95    2006-07-21

  - update PEP url
  - reorganize dist

1.94    2006-07-03

  - Fix folding of long headers with \r as line ending (thanks Adam Worrall)
  - add tests for message with no body

1.92    2004-11-11

  - Update dependencies.
  - Update test suite to support proper Test::More syntax.

1.91    2004-10-27

  - Tests use alarm(), skip those tests on MSWin32.
  - body() is initialized to '' if it isn't defined.
  - Author changes.

1.9   Fix our own damned line-wrapping.

1.8   Do our own damned line-wrapping

1.7   Sample, don't assume, what CRLF we're using.
      This means that mail with funny crlfs is round-trippable.

1.61  fixes to test suite.  there was a 5.6ish open my $fh which led to
      test failures under 5.00503

1.6 - fixes to test suite.  We were using no_plan which fails on
      older versions of Test::Harness

1.5 - fixes more warnings during ->as_string calls

      Documents more strongly that Email::Simple is intended for use
      with RFC2822 messages only

1.4 - fixes a warning emitted during ->as_string calls
      fix for header unfolding
1.3 - Many fixes from Richard Clamp <richardc@unixbeard.net>
1.2 - Text::Wrapper->Text::Wrap

0.01  Thu Feb 13 15:07:01 2003
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
    -b 5.5.3 -AX -n Email::Simple
