Perl::Download::FTP - Identify Perl releases and download the most recent via FTP

This document refers to version 0.05 of Perl-Download-FTP.
This version was released July 07 2018.

SYNOPSIS

    use Perl::Download::FTP;

    $self = Perl::Download::FTP->new( {
        host        => 'ftp.cpan.org',
        dir         => '/pub/CPAN/src/5.0',
        verbose     => 1,
    } );

    @all_releases = $self->ls();

    $classified_releases = $self->classify_releases();

    @releases = $self->list_releases( {
        type            => 'production',
        compression     => 'gz',
    } );

    $latest_release = $self->get_latest_release( {
        compression     => 'gz',
        type            => 'dev',
        dir             => '/path/to/download',
        verbose         => 1,
    } );

    $specific_release = $self->get_specific_release( {
        release         => 'perl-5.27.2.tar.xz',
        path            => '/path/to/download',
    } );

INSTALLATION

To install this module on your system, place the tarball archive file in a
temporary directory and call the following:

    gunzip Perl-Download-FTP-0.05.tar.gz
    tar xf Perl-Download-FTP-0.05.tar
    cd Perl-Download-FTP-0.05
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

TESTING THIS MODULE

This library can only be truly tested by attempting live FTP connections and
downloads of Perl 5 source code tarballs.  Since testing over the internet
can be problematic when being conducted in an automatic manner or when the
user is behind a firewall, the test files under 't/' will only be run live
when you say:

    export PERL_ALLOW_NETWORK_TESTING=1 && make test

Each test file further attempts to confirm the possibility of making an FTP
connection by using CPAN library Test::RequiresInternet.
