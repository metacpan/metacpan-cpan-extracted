        More tweaks to Makefile.PL for Kwalitee

1.002   2017-09-01
        A note regarding spurious test failures being inevitable. Some tweaks
        to Makefile.PL and the way some Author Tests are done.

        Give NWETTERS proper props. Refactor some stuff. Fix whitespace.
        Fix ancient bug where using more than one "x" or "|" in a row might
        silently fail.

        From here on out, API changes will be backwards-compatible to the 
        maximum extent allowable, though this does not guarantee the interals
        will stay as they are.

        Adding more sanity tests

        Adding more sanity tests. Had an idea of how to turn any supplied PDF
        into an RNG, by using the CDF of that PDF, and picking a random y
        (0 .. 1) and then returning that x that has probability y. Not
        implemented yet ...
