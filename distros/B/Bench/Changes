Revision history for Bench

0.10    2014-05-14 (SHARYANTO)

        - Use Benchmark as the backend instead of doing our own timing (we
          haven't factored out the overhead of null loop, for example).


0.09    2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Some POD tweaks. Add -v (version).


0.08    2012-08-05 (SHARYANTO)

        - Shuffle order of execution


0.07    2012-08-05 (SHARYANTO)

        - bin/bench: Add options -h, -M/m, -n, -I, -b


0.06    2012-08-04 (SHARYANTO)

        - bin/bench: Run at least 1s for each sub

        - Show who's fastest at the end (and by how much)


0.05    2012-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - bin/bench: Forgot to support benchmarking multiple codes
