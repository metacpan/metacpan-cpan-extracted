* when ITP for the package is found, try to deduce short/long description from
  the bug report
* --refresh: add --only <file> option: done, but "--only control" also
  touches d/rules if quilt is used
* versioned dependencies should add the epochs too (found in
  libpoex-role-sessioninstantiation-perl, where META.yml and Build.PL
  request 'POE 1.005' which should translate to "libpoe-perl (>= 2:1.0050)")
  Can be solved if the next item is solved:
* META.yml should not be used to extract information: it may contains data that are 
  relevant for other systems (e.g. Windows, Mac...). Running Makefile.PL (or 
  equivalent) will create a MYMETA.yml which contains more accurate information. 
  (e.g. will not list dependencies valid only for windows)
  See #668638
* #536838: Incorrect assumptions about perl module version -> debian package
  version. Some way of figuring out that libfoo-perl 3.42 contains Bar::Baz
  4.23 is needed. while not common, version discrepacy is very annoying.
  TODO: investigate usage of UDD. (1) can the info "package version module
  module-version" be imported and (2) would it be possible to query that from
  the web somehow, i.e. "which package+version contain at least
  module+module-version?".
  Two problems:
  (a) dh-make-perl querying the web about each dependency seems not quite
      right. Requests should be batched. One request per dh-make-perl run
      is better. Is it good enough?
  (b) will all this be enough? Given that perl module versions compare
      differently to debian package versions, the result can still be wrong.
      The same question holds with core packages, but perhaps they behave beter
      wrt (not) changing versioning scheme.
* Add a test case for finding (build) dependencies with META.yml.
* Really minor issue. The AptContents.t test can be thrown off if the contents
  directory has stuff lying around from a failed run. ~periapt
* Add a switch for "app" (foo-bar) vs. "lib" (libfoo-bar-perl) packages?
* upstream git: add remote and git fetch/merge
* At the end, rename the extracted directory from Perl Distribution
  style (Foo-Bar-$VERSION) to Debian Package style (libfoo-bar-perl),
  otherwise debuild barfs:

  debuild: found debian/changelog for package libfoo-bar-perl in the directory
    /home/…/pkg-perl/Foo-Bar-$VERSION
  but this directory name does not match the package name according to the
  regex  PACKAGE(-.+)?.

  To run debuild on this package, see the --check-dirname-level and
  --check-dirname-regex options; run debuild --help for more info.
* quilt support looks like a candidate for dropping
* make/refresh: add "Multi-Arch: same" header to arch-dep packages
* clean up after #774862.
  currently we use YAML and YAML::XS. one should be enough, probably
  YAML::XS or YAML::Tiny or ...
  The tests didn't catch the ommission either.
* massage short description more
  - lc() or lcfirst()?
  - prepend "module to"? (only for verbs. haha.)
