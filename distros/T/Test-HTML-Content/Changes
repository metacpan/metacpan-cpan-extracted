  - Fixed test bug reported by Kate Pugh (KAKE):
    t/09-errors.xpath.t was missing a SKIP: label
  - still no resolution on the other reported errors, as XML::XPath "works"
    on my Win32 machine, but dosen't work elsewhere :-(
    
    Most of the failures seem to be failures due to different text output
    of the tests:
    
    # #   <p foo="bar" />
    vs.
    # #   <p foo="bar"/>

    but as I can't replicate them here, it's hard to fix those :-(

  + Added $parsing_method to allow XML to be tested as well.

0.06 20031222
  - Fixed tests against XML::XPath
  - added another test testing the internal abstraction
    API and differences between XML::XPath and XML::LibXML

0.05 20031204
  - Added XPath functionality (xpath_ok, no_xpath, xpath_count)
  - Added fallback to old functionality if neither XML::LibXML nor
    XML::XPath are available
  - refactored code to have less duplication, at the cost of
    some functions passed as parameters (this shouldn't bother you,
    as it is all hidden)

0.04 lost in the void

  - Added a test for Pod consistency (Thanks to Andy Lester and brian d foy)

    get reported in your test file instead of somewhere within
