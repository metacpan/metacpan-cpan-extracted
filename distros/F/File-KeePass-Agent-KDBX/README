NAME

    File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX - A KeePass 2 agent

VERSION

    version 0.901

SYNOPSIS

        use File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX;
    
        File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX->new(%attributes)->run;
        # OR
        File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX->new(%attributes)->run($filepath, $password);

    See File::KeePass::Agent for a more complete synopsis.

DESCRIPTION

    This is a thin subclass of File::KeePass::Agent that uses the newer
    File::KDBX parser. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement. This module
    really doesn't do anything except provide a way to load a backend other
    than File::KeePass. You could accomplish the same thing with
    File::KeePass::Agent directly in a hackier way:

        use File::KeePass::Agent;
        use File::KeePass::KDBX;
    
        no warnings 'redefine';
        *File::KeePass::Agent::keepass_class = sub { 'File::KeePass::KDBX' };

    Perhaps in the future File::KeePass::Agent will support this without
    monkey-patching. Until then, this module allows setting the backend
    File::KeePass class in three ways (in decreasing precedence):

    Pass as an attribute to the constructor:

        File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX->new(keepass_class => 'My::KeePass')->run;

    as a package variable:

        $File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX::KEEPASS_CLASS = 'My::KeePass';
        File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX->new->run;

    or from the environment:

        $ENV{PERL_FILE_KEEPASS_CLASS} = 'My::KeePass';
        File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX->new->run;

ATTRIBUTES

 keepass_class

        $k = File::KeePass::Agent::KDBX->keepass_class;
        $k = $agent->keepass_class;

    Get the backend File::KeePass (or compatible) package name.

ENVIRONMENT

      * PERL_FILE_KEEPASS_CLASS - Name of the backend class (default:
      File::KeePass::KDBX)
