2.1.6   2013-05-06

          Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker and Graham Knop for help with this.)

2.1.5   2013-05-01
        - Eliminates a circular reference. (Graham TerMarsch)

2.1.4   2013-04-19
        - Minor version should have been bumped in previous release. To bump it
          now would be confusing.
        - Require Moo 1.001000 as 1.000008 breaks this module.

2.1.3   2013-04-18
        - Add replace_img feature (David Golden).
        - Add 'cite' to list of attributes for URI scheme checks (David

2.1.2   2013-03-20
        - Fixes broken Pod in example script.
        - Adds x_contributors to META.json.

2.1.1   2013-03-08
        - Updates Pod.

2.1.0   2013-03-02
        - Allows attributes to be validated against regexes (perlpong).

2.0.0   2013-02-27
        - Bumps version to 2.0.0 due to new features breaking backwards
          compatibility.
        - Forces all tag rules to be provided in lower case.  Breaks
          backcompat, but mixed or upper case rules would have been silently
          ignored.  So, this is really a bug fix.
        - Strips content between script tags by default. Breaks backcompat,
          but the default behaviour was likely not what anyone wanted.
        - Strips content between style tags by default.  Breaks backcompat,
          but the default behaviour was likely not what anyone wanted.
        - Adds Pod for previously undocumented allow_comments,
          allow_declaration and strip_enclosed_content.
        - Ensures stripper stack is always reset (perlpong).
        - Protects against undef string comparison (perlpong).
        - Checks URI scheme for src attributes (perlpong).
        - Removes accessor/mutator documentation.  Would prefer if all params
          were set at object instatiation.
        - Adds ridiculously basic example script.

        - Adds (undocumented) allow_comments() and allow_declartion() methods

0.02    2009-09-17
        - Improved documentation layout and clarity
