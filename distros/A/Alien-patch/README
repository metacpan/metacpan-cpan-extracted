NAME

    Alien::patch - Find or build patch

VERSION

    version 0.12

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::patch ();
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::patch->bin_dir;
     my $patch = Alien::patch->exe;
     system "$patch -p1 < foo.patch";

    Or with Alien::Build::ModuleBuild:

     use Alien::Base::ModuleBuild;
     Alien::Base::ModuleBuild->new(
       ...
       alien_bin_requires => {
         'Alien::patch' => '0.08',
       },
       alien_build_commands => {
         '%{patch} -p1 < foo.patch',
       },
       ...
     )->create_build_script;

DESCRIPTION

    Many environments provide the patch command, but a few do not. Using
    this module in your Build.PL (or elsewhere) you can make sure that
    patch will be available. If the system provides it, then great, this
    module is a no-op. If it does not, then it will download and install it
    into a private location so that it can be added to the PATH when this
    module is used.

    This class is a subclass of Alien::Base, so all of the methods
    documented there should work with this class.

METHODS

 exe

     my $exe = Alien::patch->exe;

    Returns the command to run patch on your system. For now it simply adds
    the --binary option on Windows (MSWin32 but not cygwin) which is
    usually what you want.

HELPERS

 patch

     %{patch}

    When used with Alien::Base::ModuleBuild in a alien_build_commands or
    alien_install_commands, this helper will be replaced by either patch
    (Unix and cygwin) or patch --binary (MSWin32).

CAVEATS

    This version of Alien::patch adds patch to your path, if it isn't
    already there when you use it, like this:

     use Alien::patch;  # deprecated, issues a warning

    This was a design mistake, and now deprecated. When Alien::patch was
    originally written, it was one of the first Alien tool style modules on
    CPAN. As such, the author and the Alien::Base team hadn't yet come up
    with the best practices for this sort of module. The author, and the
    Alien::Base team feel that for consistency and for readability it is
    better use Alien::patch without the automatic import:

     use Alien::patch ();

    and explicitly modify the PATH yourself (examples are above in the
    synopsis). The old style will issue a warning. The old behavior will be
    removed, but not before 31 January 2018.
