=head1 NAME

bn-wishlist - Monitor a Barnes & Noble wishlist for price changes

=head1 VERSION

This document describes C<bn-wishlist>, released December 20, 2014
as part of App-BarnesNoble-WishListMinder version 0.004.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Configure your wishlist URL: S<C<bn-wishlist --configure>>

In your crontab: S<C<bn-wishlist --email --quiet>>

To display the price history of a book: S<C<bn-wishlist EAN>>

To list books by title or author: S<C<bn-wishlist SEARCH_TERM>>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Barnes & Noble allows you to create wishlists on their website, but
they don't notify you when an item on your wishlist is on sale or
otherwise reduced in price.  C<bn-wishlist> can be added to your F<crontab>
to monitor your wishlists and email you Price Drop Alerts.  I suggest
running it once a day at a time of your choice.  I've seen sales that
lasted only 1 day, so I don't recommend running it less often.

The history of price changes is stored in a SQLite database.  You can
use C<bn-wishlist> to list books by title or author, and display the
price history of any book on your wishlist.

To list books by title or author, just specify any part of the title
or author name on the command line.  Spaces must be quoted; each
argument is treated as a separate search.  The output of a search is the
International Article Number (EAN), current price, title, and author.
(For books, the EAN is also called the ISBN-13.)

If only one book is matched by a search, then the full price history
for that book is displayed.  This shows the EAN, title, and author,
followed by one line for each price change.  For each price it shows,
the first date that price was seen, the last date it was seen, the
price, and (if applicable) the list price and percentage discount as
shown on the wishlist.

You can also see the price history by specifying the EAN.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item C<--all-history> (abbreviated C<-a>)

By default, when listing books by title or author, if multiple books
match the search term, bn-wishlist displays only the EAN, current
price, title, and author of each matching book.  If only one book
matches, it displays the full price history of that book.  This option
causes it to display the full price history for each match.

=item C<--configure>

Display the location of the F<config.ini> file, and open it in a text
editor if possible.  If the config file does not exist, a skeleton one
will be created.

=item C<--email> (abbreviated C<-e>)

Send a Price Drop Alert email if any books have been reduced in price
since the last update.  Implies C<--update>.

=item C<--help>

Display the usage message.

=item C<--quiet> (abbreviated C<-q>)

Normally, when current prices are downloaded from Barnes & Noble,
C<bn-wishlist> prints a list of all changes since the last update.
This option suppresses that output (useful for cron jobs).

=item C<--since=DATE> (abbreviated C<-sDATE>)

This prints a list of all books whose price changed on or after
C<DATE> (in C<YYYY-MM-DD> format).

=item C<--update> (abbreviated C<-u>)

Connect to the Barnes & Noble website, download all configured
wishlists, and record current prices.  Unless this option (or an
option that implies it) is used, C<bn-wishlist> will not make any web
requests.

=item C<--version>

Display the version of L<App::BarnesNoble::WishListMinder>.
