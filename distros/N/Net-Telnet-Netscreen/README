NAME
    Net::Telnet::Ns1000 - interact with a Netscreen-1000 firewall

SYNOPSIS
    use Net::Telnet::Ns1000;

    my $fw = new Net::Telnet::Ns1000(host=>'62.65.31.108');
    $fw->login('admin','password') or die $fw->error;
    $fw->enter_vsys('norway.com'); print "We are now in:
    ".$fw->current_vsys."\n"; my %vsys=$fw->get_vsys; foreach $key (sort
    (keys %vsys)) { print $key,'=', $vsys{$key},"\n"; } print @results;

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Telnet::Ns1000 is mostly a pure rippoff of Net::Telnet::Cisco, with
    adaptations to make it work on the Netscreen 1000 firewalls. It also has
    some additional commands, but for basic functionality, see Net::Telnet
    and Net::Telnet::Cisco documentation.

FIRST
    Before you use Net::Telnet::Ns1000, you should probably have a good
    understanding of Net::Telnet, so perldoc Net::Telnet first, and then
    come back to Net::Telnet::Ns1000 to see where the improvements are.

    Some things are easier to accomplish with Net::SNMP. SNMP has three
    advantages: it's faster, handles errors better, and doesn't use any vtys
    on the router. SNMP does have some limitations, so for anything you
    can't accomplish with SNMP, there's Net::Telnet::Ns1000.

METHODS
    New methods not found in Net::Telnet follow:

    enter_vsys - enter a virtual system
        Enter a virtual system in the firewall. parameter is system you want
        to enter .. You may enter another vsys even if you are in a vsys..
        Note that we will save your changes for you if you do.

    enter_vsys - exit from the level you are on
        exit from the vsys you are in, or from the system if you are on the
        top. takes one parameter... if you should save any changes or not...

    current_vsys - show current vsys returns blank if you're not in a vsys.
    get_vsys - return vsys.
        returns a hash of all the virtual systems on your system, with
        system id's for values

    ping - ping a system. Returns percentage of success (0/100).
          $sucess=$fw->ping('192.168.1.1');

    exit - Exit system
        use this command to exit system, or exit current vsys

    getValue - Set a value from the box. Will return a value from the
    firewall, or from the vsys you are in, if you aren't in root.
    setValue - Set a Value in the box. Set a value in the box, returns true
    if set successfully. (guess what it returns if you fuck up? ;)

ISSUES
    Note that on slow boxes, you might have to increase the Timeout 
    parameter to avoid the box timing out on quit (Saving takes a *long*
    time on our ns1000)
