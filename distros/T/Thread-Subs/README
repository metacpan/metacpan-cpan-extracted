Thread-Subs

Thread::Subs is a Perl library which allows you to declare that some
subs are executed by a static pool of worker threads in parallel with
your main thread.  It hides most of the complexity of parallelism
behind ordinary subroutine calls which return async result objects.

Requires Perl v5.14+ with support for threads enabled.
