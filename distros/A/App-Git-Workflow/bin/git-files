=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<git-files> command helps to find out which files are being actively
changed by whom and where those files changes are occurring. The aim is to
help developers see if other developers are working on the same files. This
should reduce the potential for conflicts later on (or at least start the
process to resolve those conflicts).
