NAME
    Crypt::Rijndael_PP - Perl implementation of Rijndael

DISCLAIMER
    This is a pure perl implementation of the new AES Rijndael. You want to
    use "Crypt::Rijndael" where available. This implementation is really
    slow, but I am working on it.

SYNOPSIS
     # Functional style
     use Crypt::Rijndael_PP ':all';

     $key = '1234567890ABCDEF' x 4; # 256bit hex number

     # keysize = 256bit, blocksize = 128bit
     $c_txt = rijndael_encrypt($key, MODE_CBC, $data,  256, 128);
     $p_txt = rijndael_decrypt($key, MODE_CBC, $c_txt, 256, 128);

     # OO style
     # same interface as Crypt::Rijndael
     use Crypt::Rijndael_PP;

     $cipher = Crypt::Rijndael_PP->new( pack('H*', $key), MODE_CBC );

     $c_txt = $cipher->encrypt($data);
     $p_txt = $cipher->decrypt($c_txt);

DESCRIPTION
    This modules shares the OO style interface with "Crypt::Rijndael" from
    Rafael R. Sevilla.

    *   Supported modes: Electronic CodeBook (MODE_ECB) and Cipher Block
        Chaining (MODE_CBC). Please use "Crypt::CBC" for CBC-Mode, as my CBC
        is not compatible with neither "Crypt::CBC" nor "Crypt::Rijndael"
        and it is subject to change in the near future. When using
        "Crypt::CBC" this module is 100% compatible to "Crypt::Rijndael" and
        you can decrypt and encrypt your data with both modules!

    *   Supported keysizes: 128, 192 and 256 (default)

    *   Supported blocksizes: 128 (default), 192 and 256

    If the size of the key does not match the given keysize then the key is
    padded with "0" (hex) or truncated to the right size.

    The last data block is padded with "\0" if it does not match a multiple
    of the blocksize.

    Warnings a raised in both cases.

EXAMPLES
    Using "Crypt::CBC"

     use Crypt::CBC;

     my $key = 'my secret key';
     my $input = 'The answer is 42.';
     my $cipher = new Crypt::CBC($key,'Rijndael_PP');

     my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($input);
     my $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

     # - or -

     #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
     #
     # Usage: r.pl e "my secret key" < in > out
     #
     use strict;
     use Crypt::CBC;
     die "Usage: $0 mode([ed]) key\n" unless @ARGV == 2;
     my $cipher = new Crypt::CBC($ARGV[1],'Rijndael_PP');
     $cipher->start($ARGV[0]);
     my $buffer;
     while( read(STDIN, $buffer, 1024) ) {
             print $cipher->crypt($buffer);
     }
     print $cipher->finish;

LIMITATIONS
    This implementation is really slow. I'm trying to tweak the performance
    in coming releases.

    CBC-Mode is not yet compatible to "Crypt::Rijndael". But you are advised
    to use "Crypt::CBC" for this mode anyway.
