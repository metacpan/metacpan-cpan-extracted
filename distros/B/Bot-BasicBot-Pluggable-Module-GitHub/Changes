        Bugfix: Issue change announcements crashed when a reopened issue was
        encountered, causing other announcements to be repeated, as the
        last-issues-state.json file wasn't updated.

        [ BUG FIXES ]
        Check for failure properly before attempting to announce a
        commit.  (Previously we checked we got something non-false back; if we
        asked for a commit that wasn't found, we get a hashref with an error
        key, so check for that.)
        
        Auth info should be optional when using !setgithubproject.  Public
        projects of course do not require auth, but due to a fuckup in the
        regex, it would not recognise it otherwise.

        About time this was released; it's proven itself in #dancer on
        irc.perl.org, and internally at my workplace, and I figured it would be 
        helpful to package them up and release them to CPAN for anyone else who
        would find it useful.
