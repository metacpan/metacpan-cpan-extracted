          - BREAKING CHANGE: path_item_uri is dropped from the populated
            $options hash in validate_request, validate_response, and

0.062     2024-04-21 18:11:43Z
          - BREAKING CHANGE: operation_path is dropped from the populated
            $options hash in validate_request, validate_response, and

            again to operation_uri in v0.065)
          - "servers" entries are now allowed in openapi documents, but they
            are not yet considered when matching URIs to paths

0.060     2024-03-20 20:56:37Z
          - remove use of JSON::MaybeXS, to avoid potential use of JSON::XS;

            to OpenAPI::Modern
          - when validating header strings against a string schema, no longer

            specification.

0.047     2023-09-19 04:29:16Z
          - strings are now treated as numbers without requiring the "type"

          - new "recursive_get" method on
            JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI for fetching a
            specification at a json pointer and following any $refs

            Mojo::Message::Request and ::Response objects, converting from
            HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response as needed; the $options hash is
            now populated with the mojo request

0.039     2023-02-11 23:23:17Z
          - BREAKING CHANGE: find_path now takes one argument, not two; the
            $request object is now passed with the $options hash.
          - the $options hash populated by validate_request, validate_response
            and find_path now includes the request object, when available
