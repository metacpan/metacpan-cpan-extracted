=head1 NAME

 UI::Dialog::Backend::Whiptail - Backend for the Whiptail dialog variant

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use UI::Dialog::Backend::Whiptail;
  my $d = new UI::Dialog::Backend::Whiptail ( backtitle => 'Demo',
                                              title => 'Default' );

  $d->msgbox( title => 'Welcome!', text => 'Welcome one and all!' );

=head1 ABSTRACT

UI::Dialog::Backend::Whiptail is the UI::Dialog backend for the Whiptail
dialog variant. While this module is used through UI::Dialog or any other loader
module only the compatible methods are ever accessible. However, when using
this module directly in your application (as in the SYNOPSIS example) you are
given access to all the options and features of the real whiptail(1) application.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This dialog variant is the staple of the Debian console apt/dpkg interface. There
isn't very much interesting about this particular backend. This is very much a
basic dialog variant in comparison to things like Xdialog and cDialog.
