NAME
    Catalyst::Controller::MovableType - Run Movable Type through Catalyst

DESCRIPTION
    Runs Movable Type 5 through Catalyst. Download Movable Type 5 from
    http://www.movabletype.org/

SYNOPSIS
     package MyApp::Controller::Mt;

     use Moose;
     BEGIN {extends 'Catalyst::Controller::MovableType'; }
     use utf8;

     1;

INSTALLATION
    Install Movable Type by extracting the zip into your template root
    directory. Move mt-static to root/static/mt. See Synopsis on how to
    inherit the Controller in your app. Presuming you installed Movable Type
    into root/mt, in your App's config add:

     <Controller::Root>
         cgi_root_path mt/
         cgi_dir mt/
     </Controller::Root>
     <Controller::Mt>
         mt_home = /full/path/to/MyApp/root/mt/
         <actions>
             <capture_mt_script>
                 PathPart = mt
             </capture_mt_script>
         </actions>
     </Controller::Mt>

    The cgi_* directives are always given for the Root controller, no matter
    what the Root controller is.

    You can modify the path where the script matches by configuring the
    PathPart as shown above. This controller defaults to match on the path
    "/mt".

    Finally, make sure that the Static::Simple doesn't affect the Movable
    Type's installation directory. An example:

     __PACKAGE__->config(
         name => 'MyApp',
         static => {
             # first ignore all extensions, then specify static directories!
             'ignore_extensions' => [ qr/.*/ ],
             'dirs' => [ qw/static/ ]
         }
     );

METHODS
  capture_mt_script
    Captures the path of the Movable Type.

  run_mt_script
    Runs the requested Movable Type .cgi script transparently with
    cgi_to_response.

  not_found
    Sets the response to a simple 404 Not found page. You can override this
    method with your own.

BUGS
    None known.
