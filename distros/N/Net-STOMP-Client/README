Net-STOMP-Client

This module provides an object oriented client interface to interact
with servers supporting STOMP (Streaming Text Orientated Messaging
Protocol). It supports the major features of messaging brokers: SSL,
asynchronous I/O, receipts and transactions.

Note: This module has been initially released on CPAN as Net::STOMP
but has later been renamed to Net::STOMP::Client to avoid a naming
conflict.
