NAME
    HTTP::Link::Parser - parse HTTP Link headers

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::Link::Parser ':standard';
      use LWP::UserAgent;
  
      my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
      my $response = $ua->get("http://example.com/foo");
  
      # Parse link headers into an RDF::Trine::Model.
      my $model = parse_links_into_model($response);

      # Find data about <http://example.com/foo>.
      my $iterator = $model->get_statements(
        RDF::Trine::Node::Resource->new('http://example.com/foo'),
        undef,
        undef);

      while ($statement = $iterator->next)
      {
         # Skip data where the value is not a resource (i.e. link)
         next unless $statement->object->is_resource;

         printf("Link to <%s> with rel=\"%s\".\n",
            $statement->object->uri,
            $statement->predicate->uri);
      }

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::Link::Parser parses HTTP "Link" headers found in an HTTP::Response
    object. Headers should conform to the format described in RFC 5988.

  Functions
    To export all functions:

      use HTTP::Link::Parser ':all';

    `parse_links_into_model($response, [$existing_model])`
        Takes an HTTP::Response object (or in fact, any HTTP::Message object)
        and returns an RDF::Trine::Model containing link data extracted from
        the response. Dublin Core is used to encode 'hreflang', 'title' and
        'type' link parameters.

        $existing_model is an RDF::Trine::Model to add data to. If omitted, a
        new, empty model is created.

    `parse_links_to_rdfjson($response)`
        Returns a hashref with a structure inspired by the RDF/JSON
        specification. This can be thought of as a shortcut for:

          parse_links_into_model($response)->as_hashref

        But it's faster as no intermediate model is built.

    `relationship_uri($short)`
        This function is not exported by default.

        It may be used to convert short strings identifying relationships,
        such as "next" and "prev", into longer URIs identifying the same
        relationships, such as "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/next"
        and "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/prev".

        If passed a string which is a URI already, simply returns it as-is.

  Internal Functions
    These are really just internal implementations, but you can use them if
    you like.

    `parse_links_to_list($response)`
        This function is not exported by default.

        Returns an arrayref of hashrefs. Each hashref contains keys
        corresponding to the link parameters of the link, and a key called
        'URI' corresponding to the target of the link.

        The 'rel' and 'rev' keys are arrayrefs containing lists of
        relationships. If the Link used the short form of a registered
        relationship, then the short form is present on this list. Short forms
        can be converted to long forms (URIs) using the `relationship_uri`
        function.

        The structure returned by this function should not be considered
        stable.

    `parse_single_link($link, $base, [$default_lang])`
        This function is not exported by default.

        This parses a single Link header (minus the "Link:" bit itself) into a
        hashref structure. A base URI must be included in case the link
        contains relative URIs. A default language can be provided for the
        'title' parameter.

        The structure returned by this function should not be considered
        stable.
