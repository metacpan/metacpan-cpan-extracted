NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::CHAP - Authenticate a user
    using a CHAP login system.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/
          Session 
          Session::Store::File 
          Session::State::Cookie
          Authentication
          Authentication::Store::Foo
          Authentication::Credential::CHAP
          /;

        __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}->{chap} = {
            hash_algorithm => 'SHA-1',
        };

        sub begin : Private {
            my ($self, $c) = @_;
            $c->chap_init; # Generate a Challenge string and stores it in the session.
            $c->stash("challenge_string", $c->get_challenge_string);
        
        }

        package MyApp::Controller::Auth;

        # *** NOTE ***
        # if you place an action named 'login' in your application's root (as
        # opposed to inside a controller) the following snippet will recurse,
        # giving you lots of grief.
        # never name actions in the root controller after plugin methods - use
        # controllers and : Global instead.

        sub login : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->login( $c->req->param('username'), $c->req->param('password') );
        }

        # Template.html
        <form name="MyForm">
        <input type="password" name="form_password" onclick="sendPassword();"/>
        <input type="hidden" name="password" value="" />
        <input type="hidden" name="challenge" value="[% challenge_string %]" />
        </form>

        # Javascript (Client side)
        function sendPassword() {
            var password = document.forms['MyForm'].form_password.value
                           + document.forms['MyForm'].challenge.value;
            document.forms['MyForm'].password.value = encode_sha1(password);
            document.forms['MyForm'].form_password.value = '';

        }

DESCRIPTION
    This credential checker inherits from
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::Password. It generates a
    challenge string that the user agent must concatenate to the password
    before encoding it with a hash algorithm. When logging in, this plugin
    will compare the sent password to the one stored, encoded with the same
    challenge string saved in the session data. It is meant to allow you to
    securely send passwords over a clear HTTP connection.

    clear text password
        If the user has a clear text password it will be compared directly.
        You just have to concatenate the challenge string to the password
        and encode it with any of the hash methods supported by the Digest
        module.

    hashed password
        If the stored password is hashed, you will have to encode it in your
        client BEFORE concatenating the challenge string to it, and then
        encode the whole string again before sending it to the server.

    crypted password
        UNIX crypt hashed password are not supported. You must store your
        passwords either in clear or hashed.

REQUIREMENTS
    You must use Sessions.

CONFIGURATION
    __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}->{chap}->{length}
        The length of the challenge string. Default is 40.

    __PACKAGE__->config->{authentication}->{chap}->{hash_algorithm}
        The hash method used to encode the password+challenge string,
        client-side. It can be any method supported by the Digest module, as
        long as you have a way to use the same on the client. Default is
        MD5. More information and javascript functions can be found at
        <http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/>.

METHODS
    login $username, $password
        Inherited from
        Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::Password.

        Try to log a user in.

        $username can be a string (e.g. retrieved from a form) or an object.
        If the object is a Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::User it will be
        used as is. Otherwise "$c->get_user" is used to retrieve it.

        $password is a hash of the password and the challenge string,
        encoded client side.

        If $username or $password are not provided, the query parameters
        "login", "user", "username" and "password", "passwd", "pass" will be
        tried instead.

    chap_init $force
        Generates a challenge string for the current session. You can put it
        in your root's begin/end actions if needed, the challenge string
        won't change until the session ends or you call this method with
        $force set to 1.

    get_challenge_string
        Returns the current challenge string.

    setup
    gen_challenge_string
RELATED USAGE
    After the user is logged in, the user object for the current logged in
    user can be retrieved from the context using the "$c->user" method.

    The current user can be logged out again by calling the "$c->logout"
    method.
