    - 0.12 is now required for compilation
    - therefore: additional statistics for get_fs_stats()
    - fixed a minor nit in the POD tests:
      make sure that Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage are
      installed in the required minimum versions
      (thanks to Ricardo Signes <rjbs AT cpan DOT org>)

0.03  2005-04-03 07:38:20 CEST
    - POD- and POD-coverage-tests

0.02  2004-06-21 07:05:16 CEST
    - running Makefile.PL could nuke /dev/null. Fixed.
      (Tim Bishop <tim AT bishnet DOT net>)
    - some DESTROY methods missing which potentially lead
      to some slight memory leaks. Fixed.
    - added sg_get_process_stats(). I must have missed that one
      for some reason.
