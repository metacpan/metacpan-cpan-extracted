Messaging-Message

Messaging-Message is a set of Perl modules useful to deal with "messages",
as used in "messaging", see for instance:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_messaging_system.

The modules include a transport independent message abstraction, a versatile
message generator and several message queues/spools to locally store messages.

A Python implementation of the same messaging abstractions is available at
https://github.com/cern-mig/python-messaging so messaging components can be
written in different programming languages.
