     object, and the help attribute for storing --help, --usage and --? state
 (RT#47865, RT#56783, RT#52474).  (Karen Etheridge)

 - MooseX::Getopt::Basic
   - Disable auto_help config in Getopt::Long, to avoid calling into pod2usage
     when the --help option is used while MooseX::ConfigFromFile is in use
     (the intent is just to fetch the value of the configfile option)
     (RT#57683). (Karen Etheridge)
