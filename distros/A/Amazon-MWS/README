NAME

    Amazon::MWS - Perl interface to Amazon Marketplace Web Services

VERSION

    0.150

DESCRIPTION

    See Amazon::MWS::Client for the implementation of the low level Amazon
    MWS API.

    For the high level methods provided by the Amazon::MWS::Uploader you
    are going to need to supply database storage.

 Uploading products

    Basically you take the products which need to be uploaded to Amazon and
    create Amazon::MWS::XML::Product objects from them:

        use Amazon::MWS::XML::Product;
        use Amazon::MWS::Uploader;
        use Try::Tiny;
    
        my @upload;
    
        foreach my $product_object (@send_to_amazon) {
            my %prod = ....
    
            try {
                my $product = Amazon::MWS::XML::Product->new(%prod);
                push @upload, $product;
            } catch {
                warn "Failure with $prod{sku} : $_";
            };
         }

    Now you create an Amazon::MWS::XML::Uploader object and do the actual
    upload.

        my $uploader = Amazon::MWS::XML::Uploader->new(...);
    
        try {
            $uploader->products(\@upload);
            $uploader->upload;
        } catch {
            die "Uploader failure with: $_";
        };

    A product upload goes through the following steps:

    product

      Basic product data.

    inventory

      Product inventory count (required).

    price

      Product price (required).

    image

      Product images (required).

      Please note that only http:// links are allowed. If you pass https://
      links, they will be rejected by Amazon.

    variants

      Product variants (optional).

    You are not by any means finished with the upload, see "Resume
    uploads".

 Delete products

    Deleting products is much more straightforward, but you have still to
    care of tracking the upload process, see again "Resume uploads".

        my $uploader = Amazon::MWS::Uploader->new(...);
        $uploader->delete_skus(@skus);

 Resume uploads

    This is necessary to check whether the upload has been processed by
    Amazon.

        my $uploader = Amazon::MWS::XML::Uploader->new(...);
        $uploader->resume;

    The uploader also goes automatically through the steps for the product
    uploads.

MWS in practice

 Product price

    Every product uploaded needs a price of 0.01 or higher, otherwise you
    get the following error:

        0.00 price (standard or sales) will not be accepted.
        Please ensure that every SKU in your feed has a price at least equal to or greater than 0.01

 Shipping costs

    You need to configure the shipping costs in Amazon Seller Central, you
    can't pass them through MWS:

    https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/shipping/dispatch.html

 Stuck uploads

    There is no guarantee that Amazon finishes your uploads at all. We had
    uploads stuck for at least a week.

 Multiple marketplaces

    You can use this module and the uploader for multiple Amazon
    marketplaces. Please make sure that you disable Amazon's
    synchronisation between marketplaces.

    For marketplaces with a different currency you need to convert your
    price first.

    The list of marketplaces can be found at:

    http://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/dev_guide/DG_Endpoints.html

 Throttling and Quota

    With Amazon MWS you have to deal with Amazon throttling your uploads
    and imposing quotas.

    Possible reasons:

    Upload too often

    Stuck uploads

    Orders with orderlines

  Throttle Reponse

        <?xml version="1.0"?>

  Quota Exceeded Error Response

        <?xml version="1.0"?>

 Upload Errors

  Error 8572: Incorrect UPCs/EANs/...

       error: You are using UPCs, EANs, ISBNs, ASINs, or JAN codes
       that do not match the products you are trying to list. Using incorrect UPCs,
       EANs, ISBNs, ASINs or JAN codes is prohibited and it can result in your ASIN
       creation privileges being suspended or permanently removed.

    This happened in our case with products having self assigned EAN codes,
    but with a well known manufacturer. Apparently Amazon knows about the
    EAN ranges for this manufacturer.

  Error 18181

    The format of the tracking number passed to Amazon was invalid, e.g.
    wrong number of characters.

  Error 20013: Image file size

       error: Image file size: 13972730 bytes exceeds the the maximum allowed file size: 10485760 bytes.

    There is no point in using such big image files for Amazon.

  Error 99001: "brand_name"

    Brand is a required field for products.
