          ('css' entry).
        * Articles can now define a 'background' setting. If so, should be a
          valid (big) image that will change the render of the post to a
          full-screen background. The article will then be displayed on a
          transparent white box. Useful for important pages that need to
          standout.

0.05    2023-11-07

        [FEATURES]
        * Caching system to avoid recomputing responses from the Blog widget
          (category landing page and permalinks are cached).
        * (Blog) RSS feed for the 'Blog' widget. A /rss/ route is declared by the Blog
          widget and exposes the last 10 published articles of the Blog instance.
          The RSS feed is cached, a restart of the app is needed to refresh it.
        * (Blog) the 'featured_posts' config entry is not mandatory anymore in
          the 'blog-meta.yml' file. If not defined, the last 3 published
          articles are returned instead.

        * Support for 'favicon' config entry to define a favicon for the site.

          of the page. Either 'footer' is displayed, or the site title.

        [FIX]
        (CSS) Navigation Bars cleanup. 
          - The mobile navigation bar is always visible on small screens, but
            not shown on the landing page by dafault, only after a scroll down..
          - The Compact navigation bar with visible nav items is always shown, 
            even on the home page, when the user scrolls and has enough space
            (not a small screen), hiding/showing is done with smooth
            transitions..
          - Category landing page fix: able to display larger areas for blog
            post cards.
          - Better header styling for article headers on small screens (font
            size, spacing).

          look and feel.
        * If 'navigation' is set, on mobile displays, a hamburger menu is
          displayed. When the user clicks on it, the navigation items are
          displayed as a popup menu.
        * Widgets now log what they do in Dancer2's logging system.
        * (CSS) Blog post header has a nice styling even when no feature image
          is set.
        * (CSS) Activities cards are now fixed to a maximum of 3 cards per row,
           with a maximum width of 320px and minimum width of 280px;
        * (CSS) Use CSS variables for common colors in liteblog.css to ease
          theming changes.

        * The provided article is a little documentation about the 'Blog'
          widget, with guidelines on how to edit the article.

        [FIXES]
        * (CSS) Images adapt their width to small screens.
        * All routes for articles, pages, categories are now forced to their
          trailing slash version (/some/article/). Requests to the version
          without a trailing / are redirected. Needed to allow images loeaded
          locally from article locations.
        * (CSS) Activities Cards sizes are now stable to 280px. Responsiveness
          is good now.

          good now.
        * Fix article->image accessor to return proper permalinks if the meta
          value of the 'image' parameter is relative.
        * It's now possible to mount the Blog widget to the root of the site
          (/). This was causing many bugs in permalinks generation. Fixed now.
