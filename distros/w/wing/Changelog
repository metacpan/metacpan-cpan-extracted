Changes from 0.8 to 0.9

Support https connections (for secure access) and port 81 connections
(to avoid the enforced proxying via multiple IP addresses done by
some ISPs).

Add explicit Date header to outgoing mail in maild otherwise a copy
saved in sent-mail won't have a Date header.

Fixed potential deadlock if /dev/urandom is unreadable.

Handle base64 and quoted-printable decoding transparently ourselves.

Send message/delivery-status MIME parts as text/plain since most
browsers don't know what to do with them.

Fold header continuation lines so that they don't get lost.

Add explicit action attributes to all <form> tags for the sake of
browsers which need them.



Changes from 0.7 to 0.8

Anonymised Oxford-specific stuff in Wing/Shared.pm for public release.



Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.7

Fixed numerous bugs in address books.

Support import of (Pine format) address books via browser upload.

Added per-user links files with folding view.

Added "portal" view.

A few bug fixes.



Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2

Changed abooklist separator to /:/ and changed address book help page
to remove ":" from list of legal address book name characters.



Changes from 0.5 to 0.5.1

Mailboxes screen was missing Help button.

maild failed to cope with messages without any sender: it bombed out of
list() and made client hang.

Removed remnants of address book debugging aids in maild.

Wing/Abook was allowing spaces in address book names but also using
space to separate the abooklist options field. Removed ":" from list
of legal abook name characters, made the field parser split on /[ :]/
and changed update_save to separate them with ":".
When all abooklist rows are updated, we can change that to /:/.

Attempting to create an address book with an illegal name now
includes the syntax rules in the error message.

Improved Wing/Admin "stat" command.



Changes from 0.4 to 0.5

Full address book support (including ACL controlled multiple books) added.

Added "du" and "finger" commands to Wing/Admin interface.

Message list says "To: ..." for outgoing messages.

Outgoing messages can be copied to the sent-mail mailbox.

Current mailbox can be exported in Berkeley format from
the "Manage" screen.

Message display screen default headers now include Cc rather than
Message-Id.

Cleanup of maild/httpd variable interaction: everything now
consistently uses maild_set/maild_get.

Button placing on the Compose screen has been changed.

Disk Usage screen summarises usage, quota and remaining space.

Icons for up and down arrow buttons have changed.

Off-by-one-pixel problem with GIF buttons tracked down to a
browser HTML rendering oddity and fixed.


Changes from 0.3 to 0.4

Clients are now less likely to hang if you hit "Stop".

base64 and quoted-printable MIME attachments are now displayed
even on browsers which don't handle the decoding themselves.
Additional HTTP headers are sent while displaying MIME attachments
to help browsers (as far as possible) to display them correctly.

Non-plaintext attachments are not now displayed in a newly-created
window even with browsers that support it: too many people were
confused by the extra window (or couldn't find it).

Client filenames are now URL-(en/de)coded automatically so, for
example, filenames with spaces appear properly instead of
containing "%20" sequences.

MIME attachments are uploaded correctly (before, attachments over
16K were corrupted). The MIME type of any uploaded attachment is
displayed in the "MIME Attachments" list. (Note: it is totally
dependent on what MIME type the client tells the server.)

Uploaded "Include" files are now placed before any sig indicator
line ("-- ") instead of right at the end of the current message body.

There is now a link to information on OUCS password policy from the
"Change password" screen.

The body of displayed mail messages is now escaped to avoid HTML any
HTML markup at all and anything that looks reasonably like an URL is
made into a hot link.

In the "Manage account" screen, cmd_manage wasn't initialising the
displayed versions of the forwarding address and vacation message
properly. They would appear correct immediately after the relevant
button was pressed but would appear blank on re-entry to the screen
(although the saved settings were stored and functioning correctly).

Successful logout forcibly expires session cookie to prevent future
failed logins from presenting stale cookie. When that happened, the
client saw a "bad session" error message instead of "login incorrect".

Removed stub "set address book search path" and "set bcc to self"
options in cmd_options.
