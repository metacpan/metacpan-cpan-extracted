    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm-Page.pm
     [RT 132403] clarify documentation on the two different rotate() methods.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Hyphenate_basic.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm-
      Docs.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/BaseFont.pm, examples/HarfBuzz.pl, 
      examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf, examples/examples.output, 
      examples/README, tools/3_examples.pl, INFO/old/examples.bat, 
      Makefile.PL, README, MANIFEST
     Implement support for use of HarfBuzz::Shaper (to shape chunks of text).
      [RT 113700] This is an optional installation (manually done). 
      examples/HarfBuzz.pl will not run if you do not have HarfBuzz::Shaper 
      installed.  HarfBuzz_example.pdf is provided in examples/resources/ in 
      case you can't (yet) run HarfBuzz.pl. It demonstrates the use of 
      HarfBuzz::Shaper for a variety of Western (ligatures and kerning), 
      Middle Eastern (script and RTL), and South and Southeast Asian scripts.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  Add 'none' option to text underline and
      strikethrough options. This was added to permit the option (underline or
      strikethrough) to be given in the code, but allow a 'none' value in 
      those cases where drawing an underline or strikethrough is not desired.
      This is still the default.

    examples/021_synfonts, examples/examples.output, examples/README
     The synthetic font example only showed for regular BankGothic font.
      Added bold, bold-italic, and italic cases. Note that there is something
      a bit odd about Bank Gothic -- it looks like it may only have regular
      weight (no bold) and the italic is questionable.

    tools/TTFdump.pl, MANIFEST, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/BaseFont.pm, examples/022_truefonts,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont/courier*.pm-
      helvetica*.pm-times*.pm-georgia*.pm-trebuchet*.pm-verdana*.pm
     Add full set of glyph widths to core font metrics files [RT 57248].
      This is intended to allow correct rendering of non-Latin-1 single
      byte fonts, by expanding the width listing beyond Latin-1. A utility
      is provided to read a TTF/OTF font and return glyph lists in a format
      that can be dropped into a [typeface].pm file. Only glyph widths table
      was changed (no other metrics). Arial was used for Helvetica metrics,
      BankGothic could not be found (not sure what's being substituted for
      it), and various symbology fonts were not changed. Courier "missing
      width" updated to reflect the character used to indicate a missing glyph.

    INFO/RoadMap  Update some items. Mention other packages PDF::Table,
      Text::Layout, and HarfBuzz::Shaper that may be useful.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm  For TTF (ttfont) fix improper 
      ToUnicode cmap so that a PDF may be searched (was broken in 3.016).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  Add example of using add() function to
      cancel Chrome browser scaling and Y-axis flip before new content is
      added to an existing PDF.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
      Remind users not to use charspace() when working with a connected (script)
      font such as Arabic, Devanagari, cursive handwriting, etc. Add -nocs
      option to text line fill (justified) routines to not use any charspace()
      values when expanding or shrinking text content to fit.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm. The earlier fix for corrupted xref table
      only ran under diagnostics. Now only the warning message is under the
      diagnostics flag (-diags), and the fixup attempt is always run.
