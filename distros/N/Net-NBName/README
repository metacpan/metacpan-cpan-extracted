Net::NBName
===========

DESCRIPTION

Net::NBName is a class that allows you to perform simple NetBIOS Name
Service Requests in your Perl code. It performs these NetBIOS operations over
TCP/IP using Perl's built-in socket support.

I've currently implemented two NBNS requests: the node status request
and the name query request. The node status request can be used to query
the NetBIOS name table of a remote host; the name query request can be
used to establish the ip address of a NetBIOS name.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES
