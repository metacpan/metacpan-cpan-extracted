WWW::Grooveshark version 0.02
=============================

Grooveshark is an internationally-available online music search, streaming,
and recommendation service.  WWW::Grooveshark wraps this service's API in
an object-oriented Perl interface, allowing you to programmatically search
for songs, artists, albums, or playlists; browse popular music; get song
recommendations; manage playlists; and more.

This version wraps a few more API methods, fixes some documentation errors,
and increases laziness potential: response objects can be used as booleans
to check if an API call was successful and WWW::Grooveshark objects will
end their session, if any, when garbage collected.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, open a terminal in the directory containing the
unarchived source and type:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This should work on most modern systems assuming you have Perl and a Make
utility installed and configured in the usual way.  The most likely change
you might need to make to the above is replacing the first line with

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

if you're on a Unix-like OS and wish to install the module in your home
directory.

The `make test' step is optional but recommended to verify that the code
works as expected on your system before proceeding with the install.  To
run all the tests, you will need a valid Grooveshark API key as well as a
Grooveshark username and password.  Take a look at test_config.example to
find out how to specify these.

DEPENDENCIES
