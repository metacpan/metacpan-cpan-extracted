    [rt.cpan.org #70177] "Many kernel calls need a session ID /
    session_pid_count"

    Many kernel calls require a session ID now. They no longer work with
    a session reference. The included patch converts all kernel calls to
    using session ID where needed. It also documents and tests this.

    POE::API::Peek does not wrap _data_sig_pids_ses anywhere. The
    included patch adds session_pid_count for this. It also documents and
    tests this.
