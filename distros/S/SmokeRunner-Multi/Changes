0.15 2008-05-09
  - More test fixes to work with even newer versions of prove.
  - Only run pod tests when making distro, not when installing.

0.14 2008-08-05
  - Test fixes to work with the latest Test::Harness. Now requires
    Test::Harness 3.0+. Failure reported by Zrusilla. RT #38152.

0.13 2007-06-02
  - Changed the tests so that none of them rely on the existence of
    external programs. Also removed the fake executables in t/bin in favor
    of mocking subroutines for testing.
  - The TestSet::SVN constructor no longer checks for an svn executable,
    and the Reporter::Smolder constructor no longer checks for
    smolder_smoke_signal. This check will be done when the programs are
    needed. This simplifies testing.

0.12 2007-06-02
  - Enabled recursive test files in Build.PL so that all the tests are run.
  - Many of the tests failed when prove was not in your path during the
    test runs. Thanks to David Cantrell for the test report.
  - Fixed the Runner/Smolder.t test.
  - Shut up warnings from Runner::Smolder when running the Runner/Smolder.t
    tests.

0.11 2007-06-01
  - This release only contains doc changes. The docs referred to a
    nonexistent Runner class, TAPModel, in a bunch of places. This was the
    predecessor to the Smolder Runner.

  - Initial release
