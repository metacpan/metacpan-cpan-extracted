About PSYC:

    PSYC is a flexible text-based protocol for delivery of data to a flexible
    amount of recipients by unicast or multicast TCP or UDP. It is primarily
    used for chat conferencing, multicasting presence, friendcasting, 
    newscasting, event notifications and plain instant messaging, but not 
    limited to that.

    Existing systems can easily use PSYC, since PSYC hides its complexity from
    them. For example if an application wants to send data to one person or a
    group of people, it just needs to drop a few lines of text into a TCP
    connection (or UDP packet) to a static address. In other words: trivial.

    The PSYC network resembles more the Web rather than IRC, which it once was
    inspired by. Each administrator of a machine on the Internet can install a
    PSYC server which has equal rights in the world wide network. #
    No hierarchies, no boundaries. The administrator then has the right to 
    decide which rooms or people to host, without interfering with other PSYC 
    servers. Should an administrator behave incorrectly towards her users, 
    they will simply move on to a different server. Thus, administrators must be
    have to be a popular PSYC host for their friends and social network.

    This implementation is in pretty stable and has been doing a good job in
    production environments for several years.
