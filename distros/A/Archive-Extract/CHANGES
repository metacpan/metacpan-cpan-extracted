  module is loaded from corelib.
  Archive::Extract is leaving core with
  v5.20.0, but will remain available from
  CPAN.

* Explicitly use Cwd's chdir

0.34    Sat Jun 27 14:23:54 2009

* Attempt to address #46948: unable to install install on win32.
  Binaries on Win32 are notoriously unreliable and Strawberry perl
  ships with all the needed perl modules, so skip failed binary
  tests on Win32.
* Address #47053: Use Archive::Tar iter to keep from read the 
  tar into memory. Thanks to Robert Krimen and Doug Wilson for 
  their patches.

0.32    Fri Jun 12 13:23:11 2009

* Some tars have extra newlines in their '-x' output, 
  so grep for 'length' when parsing the file list, or 
  errors like this one can crop up:
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/03/msg3476639.html 
* Add docs that A::E is not always thread safe. See RT #45671

0.31_03 Wed Mar 11 12:38:43 2009

* Newer versions of 'tar' (1.21 and up) now print record size
  to STDERR as well if v OR t is given (used to be both). This 
  is a 'feature' according to the changelog, so we must now only
  inspect STDOUT, otherwise, failures like these occur:
  nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/02/msg3230366.html
  Thanks to tcallawa from RedHat for tracking this down.

0.31_02 Tue Mar  3 17:01:26 2009

* Address: #43278: Explicitly tell Archive::Zip where to put the files
  In certain edge cases, archive::zip would extract to dirname($0) instead
  of cwd(); Now we tell Archive::Zip explicitly where to extract to. 

0.31_01 Fri Feb  6 15:39:13 2009

* Address #40138; .tar files on Win32 would not extract properly with
  gnu tar (default on cygwin) under Cmd.exe/Native Win32 system calls.
  Gnu tar interprets file names with a : in them, like C:\tmp\foo.tar
  as a remote path, and attempts to execute rsh instead.
  Archive::Extract now checks for gnu tar on Win32 and adds the 
  '--force-local' flag to disable this behaviour.
* Improved diagnostics from the test suite
* Enabled debugging in the test suite for development releases.

0.30    Tue Dec 16 17:32:13 2008

* This is a test suite fix; users of 0.28 need not upgrade.
* Archive::Extract would not reliably skip binary extraction
  tests when no binaries were found in $PATH, which causes
  test suite failures.

0.28    Fri Oct 10 15:22:51 2008

* Address: #39554: Must set $Archive::Tar::CHOWN, not
  $Archive::Tar::Constant::CHOWN to control the chown()
  functionality when using Archive::Tar.
* Various test suite improvements to test warnings 
  and errors emitted by Archive::Extract.

0.27_02 Wed Sep 24 17:37:52 2008

* Test & build improvements: users of 0.27_01 need 
  not upgrade.
* Test suite would die if no files were reported 
  to be extracted, because Test::More::is() would
  choke on a negative array index on an empty array
  ref.
* Up dependency of IPC::Cmd to 0.41_05 to handle 
  pipes and whitespace better on shell out commands.  

0.27_01 Mon Sep 22 14:20:20 2008

* Address: #32751: incorrect error message
  Multiple error messages are now joined and will only be 
  reset upon next ->extract()
* Test suite improvement to split binary from pure perl 
  solutions to test implementations without fallback.

0.26    Sun Jan 27 16:31:20 2008

* Address #32370: Archive::Extract will hang if stdin 
  is a pipe. /bin/bunzip2 tried to read STDIN when printing
  out it's '--version'. 
* Address rt #32336 by a.r.ferreira@gmail.com to add .lzma 
  support to archive::extract 
* Older versions of bunzip2 insist on a .bz2 suffix to extract 
  things. Guard against this, adapt the test suite and mention 
  it in the caveats. 

0.24    Thu Sep 20 15:05:55 2007

* Older versions of /bin/bunzip2 only support archives
  with a .bz2 suffix. Attempt to detect this with a new
  method ->have_old_bunzip2, and skip tests accordingly.
  Also document this in the CAVEATS section of the docs.
* Apply core change 31904: Clean up test files left 
  behind (on Win32, at least).

0.23_01 Sun Sep  9 12:39:08 2007

* Address Update ticket #27991 (Archive::Extract and 
  very large tar.gz files). Add a CAVEATS entry explianing 
  how to deal with large files & memory consumption 
* VMS shell out & test fixes by John Malmberg

0.22    Tue May 29 21:18:46 2007

* Manifest didn't include one of the source files
  for tests. If you have 0.20 installed there is no
  need to upgrade. This is just a test suite fix.
  
0.20    Mon May 28 12:06:33 2007

* Address #27195: Implement support for .Z files.
* Small POD fixes
* Disable some test diagnostics under perl core tests

0.18    Wed Apr 11 21:20:53 2007

* Starting 5.9.5, this module installs itself in
  the core-perl dir, rather than site-perl, as it's
  now part of core.
* Reverse '$PREFER_BIN' conditional for tar/tar.gz
  files. The current logic was actually exactly the
  wrong way around.
* Small regex change to tar/tar.gz detection.  

0.16    Fri Jan 26 11:07:24 2007

* address #24578: Wrong check for `type' argument
* add new method ->types that returns a list of
  all supported archive types
* promote 0.15_03 to stable  

0.15_03 Thu Jan  4 14:46:58 2007

* address #23999: Attempt to generate Makefile.PL 
  gone awry where paths starting with a '.' 
  are sometimes reported to be extracted in '.' 
  as well rather than their actual extraction dir.

0.15_02 Sun Nov 26 18:06:02 2006

* fix testing logic error, that assumed extracted 
  files were always logged when we did not prefer 
  binaries to extract with. However, that does not 
  mean the perl module is available, so we might 
  not have buffers after all.
* make sure we dont have test count mismatches 
  between buffers/non-buffers

0.15_01 Fri Nov 24 15:07:44 2006

* Apply patch from Paul Marquess to add pure
  perl support for bzip2 encoded files. This 
  support requires you to have the module
  IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 installed.
* Error storage is now per object like it should
  be rather than class wide.
* Update tests to not skip unnecessarily  
* Up required version of IPC::Cmd to 0.36 for 
  5.6.x compatibility
* Improve diagnostics in the test suite when
  run verbosely
  
0.14    Fri Oct 20 14:37:36 2006

* Tweak tests to play nicer on win32
* Up required version of IPC::Cmd

0.12    Sun Aug 13 14:55:54 2006

* Add diagnostics during the test suite informing
  the user that File::Spec warnings may be 
  generated by Archive::Zip (see rt #19713).
  These are safe to ignore.

0.11_02 Thu Aug  3 14:18:16 2006

* attempt to address #19815: make test fail under Cygwin
  again. Unzip giving trouble this time. Adding -o 
  option to force overwriting of old files
* address #20829: test failure on Win32: no bunzip2?
  bunzip2 detection wasn't working properly in the
  test suite so tests weren't skipped on missing
  bunzip2

0.11_01 Wed Aug  2 13:04:37 2006

* attempt to address #19815: make test fail under Cygwin
  by adding more sanity checks about buffers 

0.11    Wed Aug  2 11:15:48 2006

* add tentative bzip2 support
