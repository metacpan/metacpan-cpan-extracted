Geo-Google-MapObject version

This module is intended to help with the server side of using the Google Maps API.
It is further intended to meet the following requirements.
* The solution must degrade gracefully from a javascript enabled environment to a javascript free environment.
* The solution must make as few assumptions about the surrounding framework as possible.
* The data should be concentrated in a single place.
* I don't like perl code that generates javascript or CSS. That seems messy and would prevent caching of what should be static resources.
* One assumption about the framework I will make is that we are using HTML::Template::Pluggable and HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot. It might work for some other templating frameworks but I will not look into that.
