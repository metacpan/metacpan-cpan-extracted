HTML::Formulate
===============

HTML::Formulate is a perl module used to produce HTML forms. It uses
a presentation definition hash to control the output format, which is
great for flexible programmatic control, inheritance, and subclassing
(e.g. defining site- or section-specific HTML::Formulate subclasses 
and then producing standardised forms very easily). On the other hand, 
it doesn't give you the very fine-grained control over presentation 
that you get using a template-based system.

Example:

   # Simple employee create form
   $f = HTML::Formulate->new({
      fields => [ qw(firstname surname email position) ],
      required => [ qw(firstname surname) ],
   });
   print $f->render;

prints:

   <form method="post">
   <table cellpadding="2">
   <tr><th style="color:blue"><span class="required">Firstname</span></th><td><input name="firstname" type="text" /></td></tr>
   <tr><th style="color:blue"><span class="required">Surname</span></th><td><input name="surname" type="text" /></td></tr>
   <tr><th>Email</th><td><input name="email" type="text" /></td></tr>
   <tr><th>Position</th><td><input name="position" type="text" /></td></tr>
   <tr><td align="center" colspan="2">
   <input name="_submit" type="submit" value="Submit" />
   </td></tr>
   </table>
   </form>
