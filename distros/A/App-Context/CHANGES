 x App::Context          - Fixed bug with a defined variable
 x App::Context          - add authentication_class option from app.conf
 x App::Context::POE::Server - added a storable option (poe_storable) to allow for communicating more than just a string value back and forth between parent and child processes
 x App::ValueDomain      - Added sub get_label and _load_label to allow for loading of entries in a ValueDomain one at a time
 x App::Storable         - protect against varying versions of Storable which may cause deserialization exceptions

VERSION 0.9661
 x updated the dependencies so that the CPAN tests don't fail

VERSION 0.966
 x add SharedDatastore as a useful service (with a Repository-based implementation)
 x improved support for "temporary" services (named "temporary" or with the {temporary} arg)
   (a "temporary service" is akin to a stateless session bean in Java)
 x add support for including/overlaying additional config files based on values present in
   the %$options hash or when a particular named service is instantiated
 x App::Context::POE::Server
 x App::Context::POE::ClusterController, App::Context::POE::ClusterNode

 x trying to improve Makefile.PL to install things in the right place (app in cgi-bin)

VERSION 0.963
 x App->use() now detects entries in the symbol table to inhibit an attempt to load the module
 x enhance App::Service::substitute() to understand default syntax (i.e. {username:NULL})

VERSION 0.962
   I don't remember what 0.962 was all about (minor)

VERSION 0.961
 x add per-module (subversion) $VERSION numbers

VERSION 0.96
 x added &App::in_debug_scope and &App::debug_indent()
 x context->widget() now defaults to class App::Widget rather than class App::SessionObject
 x trace enhancements
   * print 'undef' instead of '' for undefined values in traces
   * made trace behave better with newlines. added trace_justify.
   * fixed a trace leak (return without sub_exit())
   * trace and debug scopes can now be exclusive (i.e. --trace=!App::Context,App::Context::Cmd)
 x log enhancements
   * added log levels (and optional args to log())
 x {temporary} widgets
 x add permissions to widget display from URL and method calls, also {open_widget_urls} option
 x add App::Service::substitute()
 x default dates can be {today}+6

VERSION 0.95
 x Widget containership is defined in the widget name by dashes ("-") instead of dots (".") (better for CSS)

 x Implemented App::Reference->overlay() more completely
