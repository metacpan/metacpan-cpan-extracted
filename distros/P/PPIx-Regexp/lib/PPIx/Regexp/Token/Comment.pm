# This must be implemented by tokens which do not recognize themselves.
# The return is a list of list references. Each list reference must
# contain a regular expression that recognizes the token, and optionally
# a reference to a hash to pass to make_token as the class-specific
# arguments. The regular expression MUST be anchored to the beginning of
# the string.

# We anticipate that these tokens will be generated by other classes:
# PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure for parenthesized comments, and
# PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal for end-of-line /x mode comments.
