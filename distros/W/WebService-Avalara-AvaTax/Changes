0.008     2015-03-12 17:46:27-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - ::Role::Connection returns to provide factored out functionality to
      the new ::Service::Address and ::Service::Tax classes; the main AvaTax
      class now exists to simply bring the two services together, compile the
      operations, and wrap them in Perlish method calls
0.007     2015-03-11 15:32:31-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - Added support for Avalara address service validation via validate()
      method. Since this service also has IsAuthorized and Ping operations,
      the appropriate methods have been renamed address_svc_is_authorized,
      address_svc_ping, tax_svc_is_authorized and tax_svc_ping.
0.006     2015-03-10 11:52:22-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    - rolled up WebService::Avalara::AvaTax::Role::Connection into main
      AvaTax class since it wasn't clear keeping it a separate role was
      offering anything beyond added complexity
    - made soap_service, soap_port and transport attributes private (i.e.,
      prefixed with a "_"), again to reduce complexity and API surface area
    - additional documentation
0.004     2015-03-09 18:11:51-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
