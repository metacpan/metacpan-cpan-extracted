NAME
    Math::Factor::XS - Factorize numbers and calculate matching
    multiplications

SYNOPSIS
     use Math::Factor::XS ':all';
     # or
     use Math::Factor::XS qw(factors prime_factors matches);

     $number = 30107;

     @factors = factors($number);
     @primes = prime_factors($number);
     @matches = matches($number, \@factors);

     print "$factors[1]\n";
     print "$number == $matches[0][0] * $matches[0][1]\n";

DESCRIPTION
    "Math::Factor::XS" factorizes numbers by applying trial divisions.

FUNCTIONS
  factors
    Find all factors (ie. divisors) of a number.

     @factors = factors($number);

    The number is factorized and its factors are returned as a list. For
    example,

     @factors = factors(30);
     #  @factors = (2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15);

  prime_factors
    Find prime factors of a number.

     @factors = prime_factors($number);

    The number is factorized and its prime factors are returned as a list.
    Multiplying the list together gives $number. For example,

     @primes = prime_factors(90);
     #  @primes = (2, 3, 3, 5);

  count_prime_factors
    Return the count of prime factors of a number. This is the number of
    values returned by "prime_factors()".

     my $count = count_prime_factors($number);

  matches
    Calculates matching multiplications.

     @matches = matches($number, \@factors, { skip_multiples => [0|1] });

    The factors will be multiplied against each other and all combinations
    that equal the number itself will be returned as a two-dimensional list.
    The matches are accessible through the indexes; for example, the first
    two numbers that matched the number may be accessed by $matches[0][0]
    and $matches[0][1], the second pair by $matches[1][0] and
    $matches[1][1], and so on.

    The hashref provided at the end is optional. If "skip_multiples" is set
    to a true value, then matching multiplications that contain
    multiplicated small factors will be discarded. Example:

     11 * 2737 == 30107 # accepted
     77 * 391  == 30107 # discarded

    Direct use of $Math::Factor::XS::Skip_multiple does no longer have an
    effect as it has been superseded by "skip_multiples".

EXPORT
