DESCRIPTION

    App::MechaCPAN Mechanizes the installation of perl and CPAN modules. It
    is designed to be small and focuses more on installing things in a
    self-contained manner. That means that everything is installed into a
    local/ directory.

    MechaCPAN was created because installation of a self-contained
    deployment required at least 4 tools:

    plenv/Perl-Build or perlbrew to manage perl installations

    cpanm to install packages

    local::lib to use locally installed modules

    carton to manage and deploy exact package versions

    In development these tools are invaluable, but when deploying a
    package, installing at least 4 packages from github, CPAN and the web
    just for a small portion of each tool is more than needed.
    App::MechaCPAN aims to be a single tool that can be used for deploying
    packages in a automated fashion.

    App::MechaCPAN focuses on the aspects of these tools needed for
    deploying packages to a system. For instance, it will read and use
    carton's cpanfile.snapshot files, but cannot create them. To create
    cpanfile.snapshot files, you must use carton.

 Should I use App::MechaCPAN instead of <tool>

    Probably not, no. It can be used in place of some tools, but its focus
    is not on the features a developer needs. If your needs are very simple
    and you don't need many options, you might be able to get away with
    only using App::MechaCPAN. However be prepared to run into limitations
    quickly.

USING FOR DEPLOYMENTS

 COMMANDS

      user@host:~/project/$ ls -la
      drwxr-xr-x  6 user users 20480 Jan 18 13:00 .
      drwxr-xr-x 25 user users  4096 Jan 18 13:00 ..
      drwxr-xr-x  8 user users  4096 Jan 18 13:05 .git
      -rw-r--r--  1 user users     7 Jan 18 13:06 .perl-version
      -rw-r--r--  1 user users   109 Jan 18 13:06 cpanfile
      drwxr-xr-x  3 user users  4096 Jan 18 13:10 lib
      
      user@host:~/project/$ mechacpan deploy

    That command will do 2 things:

    Install perl

      It will install perl into the directory local/perl. It will use the
      version in .perl-version to decide what version will be installed.

    Install modules

      Then it will use the installed perl to install all the module
      dependencies that are listed in the cpanfile.

COMMANDS

 Perl

      user@host:~$ mechacpan perl 5.24

    The perl command is used to install perl into local/. This removes the
    packages dependency on the operating system perl. By default, it tries
    to be helpful and include lib/ and local/ into @INC automatically, but
    this feature can be disabled. See App::MechaCPAN::Perl for more
    details.

 Install

      user@host:~$ mechacpan install Catalyst

    The install command is used for installing specific modules. All
    modules are installed into the local/ directory. See See
    App::MechaCPAN::Install for more details.

 Deploy

      user@host:~$ mechacpan deploy

    The deploy command is used for automating a deployment. It will install
    both perl and all the modules specified from the cpanfile. If there is
    a cpanfile.snapshot that was created by Carton, deploy will treat the
    modules lised in the snapshot file as the only modules available to
    install. See App::MechaCPAN::Deploy for more details.

OPTIONS

    Besides the options that the individual commands take, App::MechaCPAN
    takes several that are always available.

 --verbose

    By default only informational descriptions of what is happening is
    shown. Turning verbose on will show every command and all output
    produced by running each command. Note that this is not the opposite of
    quiet.

 --quiet

    Using quiet means that the normal information descriptions are hidden.
    Note that this is not the opposite of verbose, turning both options on
    means no descriptions will be show, but all output from all commands
    will be.

 --no-log

    A log is normally outputted into the local/logs directory. This option
    will prevent a log from being created.

 --directory=<path>

    Changes to a specified directory before any processing is done. This
    allows you to specify what directory you want local/ to be in. If this
    isn't provided, the current working directory is used instead.

 $ENV{MECHACPAN_TIMEOUT}

    Every command that App::MechaCPAN runs is given an idle timeout before
    it is killed and a failure is returned. This timeout is reset every
    time the command outputs to STDOUT or STDERR. Using the environment
    variable MECHACPAN_TIMEOUT, you can override or disable this timeout.
    It is always in seconds and setting it to 0 will disable it. The
    default is 60 seconds.

SCRIPT RESTART WARNING

    This module WILL restart the running script IF it's used as a module
    (e.g. with use) and the perl that is running is not the version
    installed in local/. It does this at two points: First right before
    run-time and Second right after a perl is installed into local/. During
    restart, App::MechaCPAN will attempt to install itself into local/
    unless it was invoked as a fully-contained version of mechacpan.

    The scripts and modules that come with App::MechaCPAN are prepared to
    handle this. If you use App::MechaCPAN as a module, you should to be
    prepared to handle it as well.

    This means that any END and DESTROY blocks WILL NOT RUN. Anything
    created with File::Temp will be cleaned up, however.
