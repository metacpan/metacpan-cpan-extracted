NAME
    Test::FITesque::RDF - Formulate Test::FITesque fixture tables in RDF

SYNOPSIS
      my $suite = Test::FITesque::RDF->new(source => $file)->suite;
      $suite->run_tests;

    See `t/integration-basic.t` for a full test script example.

DESCRIPTION
    This module enables the use of Resource Description Framework to describe
    fixture tables. It will take the filename of an RDF file and return a
    Test::FITesque::Suite object that can be used to run tests.

    The RDF serves to identify the implementation of certain fixtures, and can
    also supply parameters that can be used by the tests, e.g. input
    parameters or expectations. See Test::FITesque for more on how the
    fixtures are implemented.

  ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS
    This module implements the following attributes and methods:

    `source`
        Required attribute to the constructor. Takes a Path::Tiny object
        pointing to the RDF file containing the fixture tables. The value will
        be converted into an appropriate object, so a string can also be
        supplied.

    `suite`
        Will return a Test::FITesque::Suite object, based on the RDF data
        supplied to the constructor.

    `transform_rdf`
        Will return an arrayref containing tests in the structure used by
        Test::FITesque::Test. Most users will rather call the `suite` method
        than to call this method directly.

    `base_uri`
        A IRI to use in parsing the RDF fixture tables to resolve any relative
        URIs.

  REQUIRED RDF
    The following must exist in the test description (see below for an example
    and prefix expansions):

    `test:fixtures`
        The object(s) of this predicate lists the test fixtures that will run
        for this test suite. May take an RDF List. Links to the test
        descriptions, which follow below.

    `test:test_script`
        The object of this predicate points to information on how the actual
        test will be run. That is formulated in a separate resource which
        requires two predicates, `deps:test-requirement` predicate, whose
        object contains the class name of the implementation of the tests; and
        `nfo:definesFunction` whose object is a string which matches the
        actual function name withing that class.

    `test:purpose`
        The object of this predicate provides a literal description of the
        test.

    `test:params`
        The object of this predicate links to the parameters, which may have
        many different shapes. See below for examples.

  RDF EXAMPLE
    The below example starts with prefix declarations. Since this is a
    pre-release, some of the prefixes are preliminary examples. Then, the
    tests in the fixture table are listed explicitly. Only tests mentioned
    using the `test:fixtures` predicate will be used. Tests may be an RDF
    List, in which case, the tests will run in the specified sequence, if not,
    no sequence may be assumed.

    Then, two test fixtures are declared. The actual implementation is
    referenced through `test:test_script` for both functions.

    The `test:params` predicate is used to link the parameters that will be
    sent as a hashref into the function. The <test:purpose> predicate is
    required to exist outside of the parameters, but will be included as a
    parameter as well, named `description`.

    There are two mechanisms for passing parameters to the test scripts, one
    is simply to pass arbitrary key-value pairs, the other is to pass lists of
    HTTP request-response objects. Both mechanisms may be used.

   Key-value parameters
    The key of the hashref passed as arguments will be the local part of the
    predicate used in the description (i.e. the part after the colon in e.g.
    `my:all`). It is up to the test writer to mint the URIs of the parameters,
    and the `param_base` is used to set indicate the namespace, so that the
    local part can be resolved, if wanted. The resolution itself happens in
    URI::NamespaceMap.

   HTTP request-response lists
    To allow testing HTTP-based interfaces, this module also allows the
    construction of two ordered lists, one with HTTP requests, the other with
    HTTP responses. With those, the framework will construct HTTP::Request and
    HTTP::Response objects respectively. In tests scripts, the request objects
    will typically be passed to the LWP::UserAgent as input, and then the
    response from the remote server will be compared with the expected
    HTTP::Responses made by the test fixture.

    This gets more complex, please see the test data file
    `t/data/http-list.ttl` file for example.

    You may maintain client state in a test script (i.e. for one
    `test:AutomatedTest`, as it is simply one script, so the result of one
    request may be used to influence the next. Server state can be relied on
    between different tests by using an `rdf:List` of test fixtures if it
    writes something into the server, there is nothing in the framework that
    changes that.

TODO
    Separate the implementation-specific details (such as
    `deps:test-requirement`) from the actual fixture tables.
