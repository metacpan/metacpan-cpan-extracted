	Bug Fixes
	* Bleadperl v5.15.6 breaks make test: 
	  "Invalid version format (non-numeric data) at blib/lib/Parse/Trace.pm line 29"
	  Added filter in findName to skip symbols containing any /\W/ character.

VERSION 2.20 - 2010-08-13

o Force use of Parse::Template 3.04 to fix RT #58128 - (?!...) was 
  being replaced by (?\\!...) in Parse::Template 3.03
o accepts pre-compiled regexps Parse::Lex->new(VALUE => qr/.../)
o test1.t and test5.t had hard-coded version in compare string, needed 
  to be changed on every new version to match the version number in the output
o Fix PREREQ_PM in Makefile.PL
o Parse::Lex POD : missing =back after configure(HASH)

VERSION 2.19 - 2010-03-26

o Solve RT #55977 (parse::template should not be part of parselex)
o Solve RT #53574 (Bleadperl d1d15184 breaks ParseLex-2.17)
o Remove Parse::Template from the module, use the newer Parse::Template 3.01 instead.
  This solves the problem of ParseLex not passing the tests in Perl 5.11

VERSION 2.18 - 2010-02-26

o CPAN shows module description from the French pod files, instead of 
  the inline pod inside the module; rename French pod files;
o Use the same version for all files in the module;
o Add header documentation to ALex.pm and Trace.pm;
o Solve RT #1861, in a way compatible with both perl 5.8 and 5.10

VERSION 2.17 - 2010-01-06

o Parse::Template version bumped, because of conflicting ParseTemplate module

VERSION 2.16 - 2010-01-05

o New maintainer pscust@cpan.org
o Parse::Template 0.33 : Fix syntax errors
  Solves RT #7880, #12845, #14785, #11807, #48964, #53112
o Parse::Token    2.16 : Fix syntax errors
  Solves RT #12845, #36285, #48964, #53112
o test4.t : adapt to current Perl (line vs chunk)
  Solves RT #158, #11808, #11809, #12846, #14785, #48964, #53112
o tests : add blib/lib to Perl path
  Solves RT #48964, #53112
o Added test8.t with code from RT #1861, but error is not reproduced 
  in Perl 5.10, and patch does not work in Perl 5.10; 
  patch not added.
