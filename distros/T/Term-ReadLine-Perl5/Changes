Release history for Perl module Term::ReadLine::Perl5

1.43 2015-06-19

- Add IN and OUT methods as part of the Term::ReadLine spec, and
  that Term::ShellUI uses.

1.42 2015-06-18

- Remove prototype on add_line_to_history to match lack of prototypes
  in other packages that use Term::ReadLine
- Update Change to comply with CPAN::Changes::Spec

1.41 2014-09-13

- I said, Remove required use of rlib until we can get clarification on its
  license.

- More small doc formatting changes.

1.40 2014-09-12

- Remove required use of rlib until we can get clarification on its
  license

- Go over docs. More exploratory work on nested keymaps. Not done yet
  though.

1.39 2014-08-13

- Start to integrate OO Caroline when we need more than one
  terminal. Nested keymaps here need more work.

1.38 2014-06-01 Marilyn

- Break out Term::ReadLine::Dumb and Term::ReadLine::Keymap into
  their own modules
- Conform better to GNU Readline: add rl_parse_and_bind, rl_bind_keyseq,
  rl_redisplay, rl_init_file.

1.37 2014-05-25

- A stray character got into function BeginningOfLine. Darn!
- Fill out demo code better.
- Fix rl_get which was broken due to namespace change.
- Improve readline.pm pod and overall pod

1.36 2014-05-25

- Add Term::ReadLine::Perl5::TermCap to remove cyclic
  dependency between Term::ReadLine::Perl5 and Term::ReadLine.
- Remove POD redundancy between Term::ReadLine::Perl5 README and
  Term::ReadLine::Perl5
- Start to organize and document readline.pm better.
- Add demo program for interactive test. More should be done here.

1.35 2014-05-22

- more work on ~ expand for FreeBSD.

1.34 2014-05-21

- Better about resetting via setpwent() for testing.

1.33 2014-05-19 Henry Frankel
- Fix up ~ expansion via getpwent. For example. ~ro now may expand
  to ~rocky and~root. More POD in readline.pm

1.32 2014-05-14
- Remove a tilde expand test until BINGOS gets back to me on why
  it fails on his setup

1.31 2014-05-13

- Fix tilde expansion test on systems without getpwuid and where
  the initial bsd_glob expansion includes "/";
- Term::ReadLine::Perl5::readline.pod -> Term::ReadLine::Perl5::readline-guide.pod

1.30 2014-05-11 Happy Mother's day!

- rl_filename_list no longer adds classifier '*', @', '=' suffixes,
  but does include '/' for directories. Term::ReadLine::GNU and GNU
  Readline do not add these either. rl_filename_list handles some full
  tilde expansions, e.g. ~ and ~root, but not partial ones like ~ro,
  like GNU Readline does.

  This is incompatible change, but T:R:P was incompatible to begin
  with. Use rl_filename_list_deprecated for the old behavior.

1.29 2013-11-30
- Document and deprecate get_window_size(). If it can't get the window
   size, don't die.

1.04 2013-03-02

- First Term::ReadLine::Perl5 release.
- Add history commit from Rocky Bernstein.
- Fix some style changes related to use of eval() in readline::_unescape().
- Fork from Term::ReadLine::Perl.  Original changes located below.

1.0303 2009-10-28

- Would not allow macros with space in them.

- Never try to display the whole prompt unless it is shorter than
  screen width ;-).

- Test supports PERL_RL_TEST_PROMPT_MINLEN in environment.

- Test hints at special significance of the word `exit'.

- Avoid a warning on unexpected variable assign (thanks to Robin Barker).

- Change error message for unknown method.

- Protect global variables during WINCH processing.

- F_ReverseSearchHistory was not -w-safe (thanks to Peter Valdemar)

- Test for $ENV{PERL_MM_NONINTERACTIVE} also to abort tests.

1.0302 2006-05-23

- C-@ was incorrectly bound to a missing function SetPoint.

- C-x Esc c @ and C-x Esc c Space are now bound to SetMark, so do this
  if $inDOS too.

- Bind C-x @ c and C-x @ m too (as in Emacs).

1.0301 2006-05-23

- F_TransposeWords implemented

- Enable binmode() on MSWin32 if ReadMode succeeds.

- Since "normal" getc() returns 0 on "special keys" (as opposed
  to behaviour with reasonable CRT library, which would return
  a pair of keypresses 0 "keynumber"), to access special keys
  one needs something like C-[ for Esc, and C-[ c for Alt-c.

- Support \key with key in "abfnrtvd" in init files (\b/\d as C-?/C-d)
  and \ooo for octal.

- Allow single quotes in macro specifications, and backwacked quotes.

- Support macros (propagate numeric arguments).

- New functions:
    F_BeginPasteGroup; F_EndPasteGroup;
    F_BeginEditGroup; F_EndEditGroup; bound to XTerm mouse editing

- Support ~/ in INPUTRC name and $include;

- $ENV{TRP_INPUTRC} overrides $ENV{INPUTRC}.

-  New functions:

     F_DoMetaVersion; F_DoControlVersion;
     These are bound as in Emacs: C-x Esc m and C-x Esc c.

1.03 2006-04-09

- Support for numeric arguments missed setting $lastcommand.

- MinLine would not return the old value etc.

- On MSWin32 without ReadKey, but with cygwin stty.exe:
    do binmode (since Enter sends \r in these settings)
        (XXXX we don't undo binmode; is it needed?)
        (Only Control-Key work; do "Control-[ key" for Meta)

- When optimizing "cursor" movement, take into account ornaments.

- Optimize "cursor" movement even if we redraw the line.
    Would display the string twice, even if cursor was at the end of
        the line.
    Add key binding for Control-Movement keys in xterm; and some OSX xterm.
    Do not prefer HPUX xterm bindings to "normal" XTerm bindings.
    New functions F_BeginUndoGroup F_EndUndoGroup F_DoNothing
        F_MemorizeDigitArgument F_ForceMemorizeDigitArgument
        F_UnmemorizeDigitArgument F_ResetDigitArgument
        F_MergeInserts F_MemorizePos
            (for better mouse support; untested)
    Undo list merges together states where the only change is position

1.0208 2006-03-14

- Allow 2-arg form for test.pl

- Open CONIN$ on Win (if asked for CON), and open RW (bug in Win devdriver).

- Allow non-first Digit-Arguments to be escaped too.

- Allow Alt-char translation to \M-char on DOSISH.

- Apparently, self-loaded empty subroutines crash 5.8.2; 5.8.7 OK.
  Work-around: put "1;" into non-implemented stuff.

1.0207 2006-03-03

- If mark was active, redraw could be performed after Enter.

- Untested Win32 support for cut&paste.

- Alias $var_DeleteSelection for $rl_delete_selection (thus accessible
  via .inputrc).

1.0206 2006-03-03

- Shift-Ins, Control-Ins, Shift-Del operate on clipboard (if available)
  (currently native on OS/2 only, otherwise uses commands
  $ENV{RL_PASTE_CMD}, $ENV{RL_CLCOPY_CMD}, or file
  $ENV{HOME}/.rl_cutandpaste).

-  In absense of mark, CopyRegionAsKillClipboard operates on the whole line.

-  Completely ignore unknown variables in .inputrc.

-  Moving cursor should remove the highlight of initial string too.

-  Change some local() to my().

-  Region between point and mark is highlighted.
   Commands SelfInsert, Yank*, *DeleteChar remove this region
   if $rl_delete_selection is TRUE (the default).
   (Set mark again to insert without removing.)

1.0205 2006-03-02

- Do not touch $ENV{HOME} unless defined.

- $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} to skip interactive tests.

1.0204 2006-03-02

- Applied patches from Gurusamy and Slaven for vi mode:
    * Logic to move insertion point one char back was wrong;
     Disable (YES!) choice of vi-mode based on $ENV{EDITOR}.
     Just in case: generate proper warning if an old $ket-bug resurrects.
    * If readkey() returns undef, behave as on EOF.
        New option --no-print to test.pl.
        Try to move prompt to the next line if something is already on the
            current line (controlled by $rl_scroll_nextline,
            $rl_last_pos_can_backspace);
            Wrong setting of $rl_last_pos_can_backspace will result:
                a) 1 and wrong: empty line before the prompt;
                b) 0 and wrong: if the line contains 1 char only,
                    (and no NL), the prompt will overwrite it;
                    test with `perl -Mblib test.pl --no-print',
                    type `print 1'.
                [This is not the same as termcap/am!].
        New variable $readline::rl_default_selected; if true, default string
            is removed if the first keystroke is self-insert or BackSpace;
                test.pl modified to test this too;
            uses mr,me capabilities to highlight the default string.
        New command: SaveLine (on M-#).
        New command: PrintHistory (on M-h),
        PreviousHistory and NextHistory take count.
        The edited line is saved when one moves to history.

1.0203 2002-05-24

- Unconditional titlecasing of .inputrc "values" broke settings with
  values such as 'vi' etc (thanks to Russ Southern for a report).

1.0202 2002-04-18

- Warnings on highlight of the right scroll mark '<' fixed
  (thanks to Slaven Rezic).

1.0201 Unknown

1.02 2002-03-31

-  Move reread-init to C-x C-r.

-  Make C-x u and C-x C-u do undo.

-  Set-mark:                C-@, Control-Space on PC.
-  Exchange-point-and-mark: C-x C-x.
-  Kill-region:             C-x C-w (as in lynx).

-  Copy-region-as-kill:     C-x w   (kinda similar to Emacs).

   On PC, the last 2 and yank also available on Shift-Del, Control-Insert,
   Shift-Insert.

-  Kill buffer is prepended or appended in natural manner.
-  Disable detection of Japanese multibyte characters - conflicts with
   single-byte scripts.  Reenable by $readline::_rl_japanese_mb = 1.

1.01 Unknown

- Allow unset TERM.

-  Wrong display and warnings if UP/DOWN reach a short line from a
   scrolled line
