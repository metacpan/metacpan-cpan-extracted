    Recognize postfix deref in '@{[ ... ]}' for determining minimum Perl
    version.  This recognizes all forms of postfix dereference,
    including ->%*, ->&*, and ->**.  NOTE that for now this remains a
    PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation.

    Require PPI 1.238 for postfix deref support, and prune code that
    dealt with PPI's old behavior.

    Postfix %*, &*, and ** do not interpolate.

    Correct perl_version_introduced() for interpolated postfix scalar
    deref.

    Add CONTRIBUTING file.

    Try to quell weird Win32 test failures which seem to occur only in
    tests where I am using 'use open' to put the standard handles into
    UTF-8 mode. The fix (I hope) is to do this to the Test::Harness
    handles at run time instead of to the standard handles at compile
    time.

    Argument postderef is now fatal.

    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!

    Get prerequisites up to snuff, and add xt/author/prereq.t to ensure
    they stay that way.

    Refactor authortest into three, so I do not have to generate stub
    files to test without optional modules.

    Handle <<\EOD and <<~\EOD, which are equivalent to <<'EOD' and

    Normalize interpolation before feeding to PPI. This produces a
    more-easily-analyzed PPI parse.

    The ->variables() method is now discouraged. It was written to support
    Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter, but turned
    out to be inadequate for the job.

    Deprecate new() argument postderef. At this stage it is only
    documented as deprecated. In the first release after October 1 2020
    it will warn on the first use. Eventually it will be retracted, and
    postfix dereferences will always be recognized. This is the default
    behavior now.

    Correct bracket matchers to accept multiple lines. This was, in some
    cases, causing interpolations to be misclassified as unknown tokens.

    Remove redundant and poorly-performing code introduced in version

    Add new() argument index_locations which causes locations to be
    indexed during the parse. This defaults based on whether a location
    argument was provided, and whether the string being parsed is a
    PPI::Element.

    Add method statement(), which returns the PPI statement containing
    the string element, or nothing if none.

    Add PPI::Element location methods, to wit: location(),
    column_number(), line_number(), logical_filename(),
    logical_line_number(), and visual_column_number().

    Add PPIx::QuoteLike::Utils::is_ppi_quotelike_element() which returns
    true if the argument is a PPI::Element of interest to us.

    All objects now have a variables() method inherited from
    PPIx::QuoteLike::Token. This method returns nothing unless
    overridden. It was added to eliminate $elem->can( 'variables' )
    ad-hocery.

    Allow PPIx::QuoteLike::Utils::__variables() to take a PPI::Element
    (rather than PPI::Node), PPIx::Regexp::Element, PPIx::QuoteLike, or
    PPIx::QuoteLike::Token.

    Only standalone graphemes and non-characters allowed as delimiters
    starting with Perl 5.29.0.
    
    Non-ASCII delimiters started working in 5.8.3, so that is what
    perl_version_introduced() returns for them.

    Collateral with all this, accept word characters as delimiters, but
    only with at least one space between the operator and the expression
    -- that is, 'qq xyx' is OK, but 'qqxyx' is not.

  Fix problem handling nested brackets.

  Fix various corner cases, including such things as '${^O}', '${]}',
    and even '$${$_[0]}', which turned out to be '$$' followed by
    '$_[0]'.

  Also pulled the variable recognition out into a separate module in
    anticipation of it being used other places.

  Dumper message if arg does not parse

  Recognize "$^O" (e.g.) as interpolating $^O, not $^ followed by a
    literal "O".

  Require PPI, which was formerly optional. This is because I decided
    that the variables() method (which needs it) was one of the
    fundamental points of the module.

  Another attempt to make old Perls work. Version 0.002 assumed I could
    have other interpolations in a regex with (??{...}), but this turned
    out not to be the case if Perl was earlier than 5.18.0. This was
    actually a step in the wrong direction since (?-1) works back to
    5.10.0.

  Add PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper, redo eg/pqldump to use it.

  Recognize postderef slice syntax. This is stuff like $x->@[0,2] (array
    slice) or $x->@{foo,bar} (hash slice).

  Add methods perl_version_introduced() and perl_version_removed(). As
    of this release, the former returns '5.000' unless '\F' or postfix
    dereferencing are detected, and the latter always returns undef.

0.002		2016-06-11	T. R. Wyant
  Eliminte blockers to running under Perl 5.6. The significant change
    was replacing (?-1) in a regular expression (introduced in 5.9.5)
    with (??{...}) (going back to Heaven knows when, and used in
    Regexp::Common back in 2003).
