Summary of important user-visible changes for Bio-Tools-Run-Alignment-TCoffee
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.7.4     2018-07-09 19:30:49+01:00 Europe/London

  * Bio::Installer::TCoffee has been removed.  Not only did it no
    longer work and was several years out of date, it was also
    unsecure.  Either install T-Coffee via your system package
    manager, or download it from upstream.
  * Newer versions of T-Coffee include an hash on their version
    "number" so the 'version' method will return a string.  Versions
    are not numeric values so don't use like that.

1.7.3     2017-09-27 18:23:30+01:00 Europe/London

  * Replace requires_external.t with a check in the Makefile.PL for
    t_coffee.  This ensures that the installation fails instead of
    triggering a test failure since a test failure indicates a bug in
    the package.  This avoids failure reports CPAN Testers.

1.7.2     2017-09-14 16:05:56+01:00 Europe/London
  * First release after split from bioperl-run.
