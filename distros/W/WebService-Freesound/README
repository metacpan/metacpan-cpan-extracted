DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Perl wrapper around the https://Freesound.org
    RESTful API.

    Freesound is a collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed
    sounds. It allows you to browse, download and share sounds. This Perl
    wrapper at present allows you 'read-only' access to Freesound, ie
    browse and download. Upcoming versions could provide upload, describe
    and edit your own sounds (though I expect it might just be easier to
    use their website for this).

    The complete Freesound API is documented at
    https://www.freesound.org/docs/api/index.html

    In order to use this Perl module you will need get an account at
    Freesound (https://www.freesound.org/home/register/) and then to
    register your application with them at
    https://www.freesound.org/apiv2/apply. Your application will then be
    given a client ID and a client secret which you will need to use to get
    OAuth2 authorisation.

    The OAuth2 Dance is described at Freesound,
    https://www.freesound.org/docs/api/authentication.html and officially
    at RFC6749 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>. It is a three step
    process as suggested above.

    This module should look after the authorisation once done, ie when the
    expiry time arrives it can automatically refresh the tokens. The auth
    tokens are therefore kept as a file specified by "session_file", which
    should be read-only by you/www-data only.

    When downloading a sound sample from Freesound a progress meter is
    available in "counter_file" which is useful in web contexts as a
    progress bar. Format of the file is :

    <bytes-written>:<byes-total>:<percentage> # for example
    "10943051:12578220:87", ie 87% of 12578220 bytes written.

    This is optional.

    Also the download will download the sample file as its name and type
    suffix (some Freesound names have suffixes, some don't), so something
    like "/var/www/myapp/downloads/Pretty tune on piano.wav", ".../violin
    tremolo G5.aif" etc.

    The query method allows you to put any text string into its parameter
    so that you have the full capabilities of Freesound search, filter,
    sort etc, as described here :
    https://www.freesound.org/docs/api/resources_apiv2.html

    If used as part of a web app, then the process could be :

      * Check for session_file. If none then put up an iframe with the src
      set to output of $freesound-get_authorization_url();>

      * User clicks Authorise with a callback run (set in Freesound API
      credentials : https://www.freesound.org/apiv2/apply (ie
      https://localhost/cgi-bin/mayapp/do_auth.cgi) which calls
      $freesound-get_oauth_tokens ($code))> - the code will be a parameter
      in the CGI (ie $q-param ('code')>).

      * Text search box on main webpage can then be used as inputs to
      $freesound-query> - the output formatted into HTML (from XML or json)
      as you wish. With Freesound you get a picture of the waveform and a
      low quality sound preview so you can engineer your website to show
      the waveform and have start/stop/pause buttons. Best not to replicate
      the entire Freesound website, as this might contravene their terms
      and conditions.

      * A Freesound sample will have an id. This can be used in
      $freesound-download ($id, $dir, $counter_file)>.

      * Show download progress bar by continually polling the contents of
      counter_file (with an Ajax call) and drawing a CSS bar. Actually
      downloads to your server, not the web-browser users Downloads
      directory.

 METHODS

    new ( client_id, client_secret and session_file )

      Creates a new Freesound object for authorisation, queries and
      downloads. client_id, client_secret and session_file are required.

    client_id

      Accessor for the Client ID that was provided when you registered your
      application with Freesound.org.

    client_secret

      Accessor for the client secret that was provided when you registered
      your application with Freesound.org.

    session_file

      Accessor for the session file that stores the authorisation codes.

    ua

      Accessor for the User Agent.

    error

      Accessor for the error messages that may occur.

    access_token

      Accessor for the OAuth2 access_token.

    refresh_token

      Accessor for the OAuth2 refresh_token.

    expires_in

      Accessor for the OAuth2 expiry time.

    get_authorization_url

      This returns the URL to start with when no auth is offered or
      accepted. Use it in an iframe if using this in a CGI environment (ie
      send to Template::Toolkit).

    get_new_oauth_tokens ( code )

      Takes the resultant 'code' displayed when the user authorises this
      app on Freesound.org and then sets the internal OAuth tokens, along
      with expiry time. This method seriailises this in the session_file
      for later use. This is Step 3 in the process as described in
      https://www.freesound.org/docs/api/authentication.html. Returns 1 if
      succesful, undef and $freesound->error if not.

    check_authority

      Checks the session file exists, has a current token. If no session
      file, then returns URI to get the initial code from. If session file
      exists and and has not expired then it checks with Freesound.org for
      existing authority. If the tokens need refreshing and
      refresh_if_expired is set, it attempts a refresh. If that's
      successful, then updates the session file with new oauth tokens.
      Return error if the refresh didn't work (or refreshable but not asked
      to) - maybe because the authority has been revoked. See
      https://www.freesound.org/home/app_permissions/ when logged into
      Freesound.org. Return error if there is no authorisation at
      Freesound.org.

    query ( query-string )

      Does the querying of the Freesound database, see
      https://www.freesound.org/docs/api/resources_apiv2.html Should just
      let any string go into the query like filter, tag, sort, geotag etc.
      Just a string. Returns whatever Freesound returns in an
      HTTP::Response.

    download ( sample-id, download-directory, {counter-file} )

      The sample-id is unique to a sample on Freesound, use
      $freesound-query>. The download-directory is where the downloaded
      file should go, the actual sound file will be named after its name on
      Freesound and will have the correct extension (wav, mp3, aif etc).
      The counter_file is optional - it keeps a running count of the
      download progress . In a web environment a Javascript Ajax call can
      read this in real-time to give a progress bar. counter_file probably
      needs to be named with a session id of some sort. Returns the path of
      the file or undef (then see $freesound-error>).

    get_filename_from_id ( id )

      Does a query to get two fields - name and type (wav, mp3, aif etc)
      from the Freesound id of the sample. Returns undef and
      $freesound->error if can't find a name/type for this id.

INTERNAL SUBROUTINES/METHODS

    Please don't use these as they may change on a whim.

    _post_request

      Updates the objects oauth tokens and session file from User Agent
      response. Returns 1 or undef and $freesound->error.
