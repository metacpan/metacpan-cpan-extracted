Imager-File-HEIF 0.005 - 26 Nov 2023
======================

 - the user can now limit the number of decoding threads used by
   libheif with libheif 1.13.0 or later.

 - EXIF metadata is now parsed if found using the tags described in
   Imager::File::HEIF
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager-file-heif/issues/4

Imager-File-HEIF 0.004 - 10 Nov 2023
======================

 - require libheif 1.9.0 or 1.11.0 or later (not 1.10.0)
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager-file-heif/issues/1

 - support grayscale images
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager-file-heif/issues/2

 - fix a potentially large memory leak when writing images
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/511

 - newer libheif wants the heif_error message filled even
   on success.

 - improve write error reporting

 - support calling into libheif's clean up code (requires 1.13.0)

 - add some continuous integration
   Unfortunately libheif and friends produce enough valgrind errors
   I couldn't add detect for leaks like those above.

 - documentation updates to match changes to libheif and
   Imager::File::HEIF.

 - make some internal functions into methods, some might be useful
   in bug reporting, some you shouldn't use.

Imager-File-HEIF 0.003 - 05 Apr 2019
======================

 - require libheif 1.4.0.
   Older versions don't properly initialize some class members which
   can result in images that don't meet the spec for non-trivial
   programs.  libheif itself can load such images, but other software
   (OS X Preview at least) will fail to load the image.

 - use the encoder defaults for quality instead of our own.

 - use a new libheif encoder object for each image rather than re-using
   the encoder object.

Imager-File-HEIF 0.002 - 11 Feb 2019
======================

Improve library probing to:

 - reject too old libraries

 - reject libraries without h.265 encoding (libx265) and decoding
   (libde265)

Imager-File-HEIF 0.001 - 10 Feb 2019
======================

Initial release.

Supports reading and writing HEIF/HEIC images.

You can specify the compression level or use lossless compression,
though the RGB => YCbCr conversion makes that lossy too.
