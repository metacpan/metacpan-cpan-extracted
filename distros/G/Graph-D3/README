NAME
    Graph::D3 - Create ref/json to show node-edge graph with D3.js

SYNOPSIS
      use Graph;
      use Graph::D3;
      my $g = new Graph(
          vertices => [qw/1 2 3 4 5/], 
          edges => [[qw/1 2/], [qw/2 3/], [qw/3 5/], [qw/4 1/]] 
      );
      my $d3 = new Graph::D3(graph => $g);
      my $output = $d3->force_directed_graph(); #output is hash reference
      $output = $d3->hierarchical_edge_bundling(); #output is hash reference

      $d3 = new Graph::D3(graph => $g, type => json); 
      my $json = $d3->force_directed_graph(); # output is json format
      $json = $d3->hierarchical_edge_bundling(); # output is json format

DESCRIPTION
    Graph::D3 is a moudle to covert Graph object to the format which is used
    in d3.js(http://d3js.org/). This module simply supports node-edge graph
    in the example.

METHODS
  force_directed_graph
    This outputs the format which is used for Force Directed Graph described
    below.

    The input graph should be directed grpah. Node in Graph can have 'group'
    attribute (Default is all 1) to have different node color. Also Edge in
    Graph can have 'value' attribe(defalut is all 1).

  hierarchical_edge_bundling
    http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html

    The input graph shoudl be directed graph. Node in Graph can have 'size'
    attribute (Default is all 1).
