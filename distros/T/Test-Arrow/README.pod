    my $arr = Test::Arrow->new;

    $arr->ok(1);
    $arr->got(1)->ok;

    $arr->name('Test Name')
        ->expected('FOO')
        ->got(uc 'foo')
        ->is;

    $arr->expected(6)
        ->got(2 * 3)
        ->is_num;

    # `unlike` shows where a place could have matched if it's failed
    $arr->name('Unlike Fail example')
        ->expected(qr/b/)
        ->got('abc')
        ->unlike;
