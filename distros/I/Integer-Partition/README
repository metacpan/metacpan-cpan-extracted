TESTING

This module requires the following module for thorough testing:

    Test::More

The following test modules are optional:

    Test::Exception
    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

It can also make use of Devel::Cover if available.

UNINSTALLATION

This is a pure-Perl module. The following one-liner should print
out the canonical path of the file:

  perl -MInteger::Partition -le 'print $INC{"Integer/Partition.pm"}'

Just delete this file. There is also the question of the man page.
Finding that is left as an exercise to the reader.

USAGE

use Integer::Partition;

my $i = Integer::Partition->new(6);

while (my $p = $i->next) {
    print join( ' ', @$p ), $/;
}

# prints:

6
5 1
4 2
4 1 1
3 3
3 2 1
3 1 1 1
2 2 2
2 2 1 1
2 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1

IMPLEMENTATION
