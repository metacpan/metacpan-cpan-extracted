Error-Base version v1.0.2

J'avais cru plus difficile de mourir. 
        -- Louis XIV

Die early, die often. Make frequent sanity checks and die when a check fails. 
See neat dumps of the caller stack with each error. Construct a group of 
error messages in one object or write error text ad hoc. Trap an error 
object and examine the contents; or let it tell its sad tale and end it. 

Error::Base usage can be simple or complex. For quick sanity checks, 
construct and throw a simple fatal error in one line. At the other extreme, 
you can override methods in your own error subclasses. 

Error::Base is lightweight. It defines no global variables, uses no non-core 
modules (and few of those), exports no symbols, and is purely object-oriented.
I hope you will be able to use it commonly instead of a simple die(). 
You are not required to subclass it.
