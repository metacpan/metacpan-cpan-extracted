        $dbh->do('…', {async=>0}, sub { my ($rv, $dbh) = @_; … });

DESCRIPTION

    This module is an AnyEvent user, you need to make sure that you use and
    run a supported event loop.

    This module implements asynchronous MySQL queries using "ASYNCHRONOUS
    QUERIES" in DBD::mysql feature. Unlike AnyEvent::DBI it doesn't spawn
    any processes.

    You shouldn't use {RaiseError=>1} with this module and should check
    returned values in your callback to detect errors. This is because with
    {RaiseError=>1} exception will be thrown instead of calling your
    callback function, which isn't what you want in most cases.

INTERFACE

    The API is trivial: use it just like usual DBI, but instead of
    expecting return value from functions which may block add one extra
    parameter: callback. That callback will be executed with usual returned
    value of used method in params (only exception is extra $dbh/$sth param
    in do() and execute() for convenience).

 SYNCHRONOUS QUERIES

    In most cases to make usual synchronous query it's enough to don't
    provide callback - use standard DBI params and it will work just like
    usual DBI. Only exception is prepare()/execute() pair: you should use
    {async=>0} attribute for prepare() to have synchronous execute().

    For convenience, you can quickly turn asynchronous query to synchronous
    by adding {async=>0} attribute - you don't have to rewrite code to
    remove callback function. In this case your callback will be called
    immediately after executing this synchronous query.

 SUPPORTED DBI METHODS

  connect

        $dbh = AnyEvent::DBI::MySQL->connect(...);

    DBD::mysql support only single asynchronous query per MySQL connection.
    To make it easier to overcome this limitation provided connect()
    constructor work using DBI->connect_cached() under the hood, but it
    reuse only inactive $dbh - i.e. one which you didn't use anymore. So,
    connect() guarantee to not return $dbh which is already in use in your
    code. For example, in FastCGI or Mojolicious app you can safely use
    connect() to get own $dbh per each incoming connection; after you send
    response and close this connection that $dbh should automatically go
    out of scope and become inactive (you can force this by $dbh=undef;);
    after that this $dbh may be returned by connect() when handling next
    incoming request. As result you should automatically get a pool of
    connected $dbh which size should match peak amount of simultaneously
    handled CGI requests. You can flush that $dbh cache as documented by
    DBI at any time.

    NOTE: To implement this caching behavior this module catch DESTROY()
    for $dbh and instead of destroying it (and calling $dbh->disconnect())
    make it available for next connect() call in cache. So, if you need to
    call $dbh->disconnect() - do it manually and don't expect it to happens
    automatically on $dbh DESTROY(), like it work in DBI.

    Also, usual limitations for cached connections apply as documented by
    DBI (read: don't change $dbh configuration).

  do

        $dbh->do(..., sub {
            my ($rv, $dbh) = @_;
            ...
        });

  execute

        $sth->execute(..., sub {
            my ($rv, $sth) = @_;
            ...
        });

  selectall_arrayref

        $dbh->selectall_arrayref(..., sub {
            my ($ary_ref) = @_;
            ...
        });

  selectall_hashref

        $dbh->selectall_hashref(..., sub {
            my ($hash_ref) = @_;
            ...
        });

  selectcol_arrayref

        $dbh->selectcol_arrayref(..., sub {
            my ($ary_ref) = @_;
            ...
        });

  selectrow_array

        $dbh->selectrow_array(..., sub {
            my (@row_ary) = @_;
            ...
        });

  selectrow_arrayref

        $dbh->selectrow_arrayref(..., sub {
            my ($ary_ref) = @_;
            ...
        });

  selectrow_hashref

        $dbh->selectrow_hashref(..., sub {
            my ($hash_ref) = @_;
            ...
        });

LIMITATIONS

    These DBI methods are not supported yet (i.e. they work as usually - in
    blocking mode), mostly because they internally run several queries and
    should be completely rewritten to support non-blocking mode.

    NOTE: You have to provide {async=>0} attribute to prepare() before
    using execute_array() or execute_for_fetch().

        $sth->execute_array
        $sth->execute_for_fetch
        $dbh->table_info
        $dbh->column_info
        $dbh->primary_key_info
        $dbh->foreign_key_info
        $dbh->statistics_info
        $dbh->primary_key
        $dbh->tables
