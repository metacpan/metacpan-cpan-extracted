0.58     2018-06-08

- Re-release to fix the generated Makefile.PL. We do not want to try to build
  the XS code with compiler warnings enabled except on Perl 5.24+. There are
  unavoidable warnings with older Perls. If you tried to install this distro
  in an environment where AUTHOR_TESTING was set, these warnings would be
  enabled, along with "-Werror", causing the build to fail
  completely. Reported by Olaf Alders. GH #3.


0.57     2018-05-26

- Fix C compiler warnings. Reported by Jim Keenan. GH #2.


0.56     2017-12-12

- The one() sub returned true when given an empty list, but it should return
  false. Reported by randyl. GH #3.


0.55     2017-07-23

- Skip all the tests unless List::SomeUtils 0.56 is installed. This fixes the
  issue where trying to install the new List::SomeUtils ends up pulling this
  distribution, which then fails because an older LSU is installed but doesn't
  export mode(). Reported by John SJ Anderson. GH #1.


0.54     2017-07-22

- Added a new function, mode(), requested by Jerrad Pierce. GH #2.


0.53     2017-06-01

- Moved issue tracking to GitHub.


0.52     2016-05-06

- Contains XS code changes from List::MoreUtils 0.415 ...
- fix RT#75727 - after's XS implementation call XSRETURN(-1) when it
  doesn't find an element (2nd patch provided by Reini Urban,
  regression test provided by Tony Cook)
- fix RT#113117 - XS's minmax() sometimes return undef (perl >= 5.20),
  thanks PERLANCAR and SREZIC
- explicit test for thesis in RT#110998 - XS implementation of pairwise
  fails with memory allocation error when there are more return values
  than in original lists -- thesis is proven wrong
- efficiency improvements by bulk88
- improve some tests to get clearer reports
