Revision history for Perl extension Finance::Bank::Postbank_de.

0.55 2018-12-03
  * Adapt to site (well, API-data) changes
    BAUFINANZIERUNG accounts will not be returned for the time being

0.54 2018-09-02
  + Add missing prerequisite for JSON, Future
    This addresses RT #127022 , reported by Slaven Rezic

0.53 2018-09-02
  + Add missing prerequisite for Filter::signatures
    This addresses RT #127022 , reported by Slaven Rezic

0.52 2018-09-02
  [Distribution]
  + This is most likely a breaking change. I've tried to keep the old interface
    alive and so far, the test suite passes with what I think are mostly
    data changes and removal of old tests that reached too deep.
  + Merge the API branch, as the old website got switched off.
  + There is no compatibility shim yet to restore the functionality of the old
    module. The tests will currently fail, sorry.
  + All files are now stored and read as UTF-8 indiscriminately.
  + Use the new API, which could be less fragile than the scraping approach
    used before.

0.51 2018-07-17
  [Distribution]
  + Fix prerequisites
    Test::MockObject was missing, MIME::Lite is only a test prerequisite

0.50 2018-07-16
  [Certificate fixes]
  + Fix SSL certificate check to reflect the (systems) merger of Postbank
    and Deutsche Bank
  [Code fixes]
  + Fix handling of session after downloading a CSV file

0.49 2018-04-21
  [Test fixes]
  + Better maintenance detection, mostly for the demo site
  + Better test resiliency, mostly for the demo site

0.48 2018-02-22
  [Certificate fixes]
  + Add some text aliases used/produced by some BSD version of SSL

0.47 2017-07-16
  [Certificate fixes]
  + Add one more numeric identifier for certificates
    This fixes RT #122506, reported by Slaven Rezic

0.46 2017-07-16
  [Code fixes]
  + Make module more resilient against old versions of IO::Socket::SSL
    which don't have OCSP support
    This was reported by the CPAN testers with at least IO::Socket::SSL
    version 1.967
  [Certificate fixes]
  + Update certificate

0.45 2017-04-17
  [Test fixes]
  . Fix test suite that broke due to . (dot) not being in
    @INC anymore, thanks to Ryan Voots

0.44 2016-11-22
  [Test fixes]
  . Remove the EURO sign from the canned account statement
    This should address RT #117204, again; reported by
    Slaven Rezic, thanks!

0.43 2016-10-15
  [Code fixes]
  ! We only enable fingerprint verification for OpenSSL versions
    below 1.0.2. For 1.0.2 and higher, we rely on OpenSSL to do
    The Right Thing.
    Note that Debian Jessie will stay on 1.0.1
  + Make past_days work better (provided by Harald Becker)
  + Reorder module loading so that Finance::Bank::Postbank_de doesn't
    get loaded twice.

0.42 2016-09-03
  [Certificate fixes]
  ! Mozilla::CA 2016-01-04 does not support the G3 certificate from Symantec, but postbank.de
    relies on that certificate. We now check the fingerprint of the postbank.de
    certificate instead of verifying the certificate chain.
    An alternative fix is to fall back to the 2013 version of Mozilla::CA.

0.41 2016-09-02
  [Code fixes]
  + Allow to specify the days to request the statement for
  + Better resiliency against where the EURO sign appears

0.40 2016-06-19
  [Code fixes]
  + Allow more numerical entities in certificate. Yay ASN

0.39 2016-06-12
  . Add license (Artistic license)
  [Code fixes]
  . Adapt to new number/currency format in the statement output

0.38 2015-11-15
  [Code fixes]
  + Adapt to the website changes (new form field names)

0.37 2015-07-31
  + New certificate text
  [Code fixes]
  + Use ->decoded_content when downloading an account statement, in case
    it gets gzipped
  . Allow OIDs and names in certificate
    Some SSL libraries know about the names for the OIDs, but older
    versions of OpenSSL don't.

    The real fix would be to teach OpenSSL the new(er) OIDs

0.36 201507xx
  + New certificate text

0.35 2014-09-22
  + Adapt to the website changes
    Session function URLs now change with each page

0.34 2014-07-06
  + Adapt to the website changes
  . (Forgot to include this in the release)

0.33 2014-02-01
  + Use Mozilla::CA to get a maintained certificate chain
    Contributed by Sven Nierlein
  . No other code changes, no need to upgrade
  . Test updates to IBANs now being returned in some places instead of account numbers

0.32 2013-08-29
  + Adjust parser for the new website.
    The parser now uses the link titles. This means tht if the website
    ever uses a different language than German, this module will not
    work with that setting.
  + Add method to fetch the count of unread messages.

0.31 2013-08-10
  + Added link to repository, thanks to D. Steinbrunner

0.30 2013-07-29
  + Adjusted to the new postbank.de certificate/subject

0.29 2013-05-14
  + Adjusted to the new postbank.de certificate/subject
  + Test fixes for slight changes in the website
  ! We now explicitly require LWP::Protocol::https as a prerequisite to ensure HTTPS support
  . Test fixes

0.28 2012xxxx
  ! Perl 5.6 is now the minimum version, needed for syntax
  ! Perl 5.8 is needed for the Encode handling
  ! Major changes to new interface of Postbank.de
  ! We now decode all strings to UTF-8
  ! running_total is now formatted as a Perl number, not as a string anymore
  ! We need WWW::Mechanize v1.52 minimum, because it has the ->form_id method
  . Files still get stored as CP-1252, Postbank claims these are encoded as UTF-8 :)
  . Do not upgrade without a working fallback strategy!

0.27 2011-07-28
  - Adjusted to the new Postbank.de certificate/SSL-Cert-Subject
    /1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=DE/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.1=Bonn/2.5.4.15=Private Organization/serialNumber=HRB6793/C=DE/postalCode=53113/ST=NRW/L=Bonn/streetAddress=Friedrich Ebert Allee 114 126/O=Deutsche Postbank AG/OU=Systems AG/CN=banking.postbank.de
   Reported and code fix by Pablo Schlaepfer

  - Bumped WWW::Mechanize prerequisite to 1.30

  - Changed one call from ->follow() to ->follow_link().

0.26 2007-08-21
  - The Postbank certificate changed, reported by Reto Heygel
  - The Postbank site is buggy and caches statements based on only the referencing URL,
    not the referencing URL and the query parameters. The stupid workaround currently
    is to only query one account per session. The test suite does just that.

        $account->agent(undef);

    is the magic incantation. This will force a fresh login on the next request.
  - HTML updates

0.25 2006-11-25
  - Postbank changed the format of the account statement
    thankfully reported again by Reto Heygel
  - adapted tests to match the new format

0.24
  - Another small HTML change, thankfully reported by
    Reto Heygel

0.23 2006-03-27
  - Moved to Test::Inline 2.x
  - Cleaned up MANIFEST

0.22 2005-09-28
  - Postbank changed their layout again and added yet another
    advisory page that must be skipped.

0.21 2005-04-13
  - Markus Preis informed me of two changes to the Postbank
    layout even before I noticed them! Thanks Markus!

0.20 2004-11-13
  - Moved to the new web interface and hopefully didn't break anything
  ! The account accessor C<name> is now different from C<number> !!!
    They used both to contain the account number but now the name
    contains the name of the account owner(s).
  ! White space in the comment fields may have changed positions!
  ! White space at the end of fields is stripped! This is different
    from the files you download directly from the web interface!
  ! The type names have changed:
      'GUTSCHRIFT' 	=>  'Gutschrift'
      'ÜBERWEISUNG'  =>   "\xfcberweisung"
      'SCHECK'		=>   "Scheckeinreichung"
      'LASTSCHRIFT'	=>   "Lastschrift"
      'INH. SCHECK'	=>   "Inh. Scheck"
    The names are passed through directly so you will need to adapt
    your program(s).
  ! The postbank now fills in more fields (sender/receiver) all the time.
  ! The credit card accounts are not returned!!
  ! The two embedded tests fail, but I don't know why :-(

0.11 2004-11-08
  - Fixed erroneous skip count in t/02-maintenance.t.
    This bogus failure was only triggered when no SSL capability
    is available.
  - The Postbank changed the look of their website. I cheated and
    use the old, 'classic' HTML interface.

0.10 2004-09-04
  - The Postbank changed their certificate, which rightfully tripped
    up the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header.

0.09 2003-11-08
  - Added List::Sliding::Changes as a hard prerequisite. It's only
    needed for the examples, but I grew tired of the bug reports.
  - Added certificate checking through LWP If-SSL-Cert-Subject header
  - now needs WWW::Mechanize v0.64 due to autocheck => 1

0.08 2003-11-07
  - The error number for wrong PIN changed from 10011 to 9501
  - The maintenance screen now got an error number: 5010
  - The tests now dump html files if they don't match expectations
  - added test to check for maintenance mode detection
  - the $agent now moves to the previous page after downloading stuff

0.07 2003-05-20
  - Thanks to Markus Preis for reporting the bugs fixed in this release
  - Fixed Finance::Postbank_de::Account synopsis
  - Added test and fix for negative account balance ...
  - Added tests to actually test the Synopsis of both modules

0.06 2003-02-07
  - Restructured ::Postbank_de::Account::transactions()
  - Introduced some aliases for field names
  - talked to Briac Pilpre about moving to common Account / Transaction classes
  - One synopsis example is possibly still failing under Perl 5.8, but I can't
    confirm / reproduce it
  - hopefully fixed the inline tests so that they work under Perl 5.8

0.05 2003-02-06
  - Fixed inline POD tests/examples (how I hate broken synopsis code)
  - Added access_denied() to Finance::Bank::Postbank_de
  - Added error_page() to Finance::Bank::Postbank_de for generic error recognition

0.04 2003-02-04
  - Revamped tests to include the examples
  - Examples use List::Sliding::Changes

0.03 2003-01-26
  - Updated dependencies of the test files in Makefile.PL
  - Different handling of EOL for better compatibility with Unix

0.02 2003-01-23
  - Added checking for https capability of LWP to all tests
  - Name change from Finance::Bank::Postbank to Finance::Bank::Postbank_de due to
    conflicting different bank in the netherlands with the same name

0.01  Sat Jan 11 12:28:10 2003
  - original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
    -X Finance::Bank::Postbank
