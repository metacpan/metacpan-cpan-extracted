NAME
    CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::MetaCPAN - MetaCPAN source implementation

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
      # In the CPANPLUS shell

      CPAN Terminal> s conf no_update 1
      CPAN Terminal> s conf source_engine CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::MetaCPAN
      CPAN Terminal> s save

DESCRIPTION
    CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::MetaCPAN is a <http://metacpan.org/> source
    implementation.

    It is highly experimental.

    Usually CPANPLUS retrieves the CPAN index files, extracts them and
    builds an in-memory index of every module listed on CPAN. As you can
    imagine, this is quite memory intensive.

    This source implementation does things slightly different.

    Instead of building an in-memory index, it queries the
    <http://metacpan.org/> website for module/distribution/author
    information as and when it is required by CPANPLUS.

CAVEATS
    There are some caveats.

    As shown in the "SYNOPSIS" you must set the CPANPLUS configuration
    variable "no_update" to a true value to use this source engine. This
    prevents CPANPLUS from attempting to update CPAN indexes.

    Attempting to do searches and getting a list of out of date modules in
    CPANPLUS are incredibly slow due the million or so web accesses that are
    incurred.
