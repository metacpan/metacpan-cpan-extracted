NAME
    JavaScript::V8x::TestMoreish - Run and test JavaScript code in Perl
    using Test::More and v8

VERSION
    Version 0.013

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More

        plan qw/no_plan/

        is( 1, 1 )

        use JavaScript::V8x::TestMoreish

        test_js( <<'_END_' )
        diag( "Hello, World." );
        areEqual( 1, 1 );
        areEqual( 1, 2 );
        like( "Hello, World.", /o, World/ )
            like( "Hello, World.", /Alice/ )
        _END_

DESCRIPTION
    JavaScript::V8x::TestMoreish uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine (via
    JavaScript::V8) to execute JavaScript code on demand in Perl. In
    addition, the customized context binds some functions that expose parts
    of Test::More to facillate testing.

    An installation of "libv8" (for JavaScript::V8) is required.

    You can interleave regular Test::More tests and JavaScript tests as
    usual.

JavaScript USAGE
  diag( $message )
        "Print" $message as Test::More does with diag

  areEqual( $got, $expected, $name )
        $got == $expected

  like( $got, $match, $name )
        isValue( $got ) && isString( $got ) && $got.match( $match )

USAGE
  test_js( $js )
    Evaluate $js in a Test::More-ish context (see JavaScript USAGE for
    available functionality)
