Revision history for Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ApacheTest

0.03  2016-07-03
    - add Plugin::ApacheTest for compatibility with previous releases. This is
      marked deprecated in docs and is equivalent to [MakeMaker::ApacheTest]
      currently.
    - update compile tests
    - fix possible signature test if generated files are not ignored

0.02  2016-07-01
  *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE - This module now is a plugin bundle which includes a
      MakeMaker plugin as well as a DynamicPrereq plugin.  Your dist.ini needs to
      change from [ApacheTest] to [@ApacheTest]
    - Reimplement using Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Awesome. This avoids
      replacing the MakeMaker plugin and greatly simplifies things.
    - use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DynamicPrereqs to require either mod_perl v1 if
      it is installed, otherwise mod_perl2.
