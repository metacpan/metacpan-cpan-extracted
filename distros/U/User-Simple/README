User::Simple - Simple user sessions management

User::Simple provides a very simple framework for validating users,
managing their sessions and storing a minimal set of information (this
is, a meaningful user login/password pair) and allowing for
transparent access of arbitrary data (i.e. the user's name, privilege
level, etc.) via a database. The sessions can be used as identifiers
for i.e. cookies on a Web system. The passwords are stored as MD5
hashes (this means, the password is not stored in clear text). 

User::Simple includes User::Simple::Admin, which provides the basic
functionalities to manage the users.

User::Simple was originally developed with a PostgreSQL database in
mind, but should work with any DBD, even those not implemented with a
real RDBMS (i.e. XBase, CSV, etc).
