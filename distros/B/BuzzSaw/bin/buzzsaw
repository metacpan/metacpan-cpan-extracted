=head1 NAME

buzzsaw - The BuzzSaw log file processing suite.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to buzzsaw version 0.12.0

=head1 USAGE

    buzzsaw help

    buzzsaw help import

    buzzsaw import [--readall] [--configfile foo.yaml]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a command-line tool which allows you to issue various commands
to the BuzzSaw log file processing suite.

=head1 COMMANDS

There are two built-in commands:

=over

=item help [command name]

If you call the C<help> command with no arguments it will list all the
supported commands. If you also specify a particular command name it
will show all the available command-line options for that specific
command.

=item commands

This command gives a list of all available commands.

=back

The following standard commands are each implemented with a separate
Perl module. For full documentation you need to read the perldoc for
the specific module. They are all in the C<BuzzSaw::Cmd>
namespace. It is possible to extend this list with extra, locally
supplied, commands with Perl modules in the same namespace.

Note that it is possible to use the shortest unique name for a command
rather than typing the whole thing.

=over

=item import - L<BuzzSaw::Cmd::Import>

Scans sets of logs for events of interest and stores them in a database.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Many of these commands can be configured via configuration files as
well as via their command line options. The configuration files are
typically stored in the C</etc/buzzsaw> directory. You should read the
documentation for the individual Perl modules to see what files are
examined.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

After successfully running a command it will exit with code zero. An
error will result in a non-zero error code.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses L<App::BuzzSaw> which is L<Moose> powered and the
L<MooseX::App::Cmd> module is used to handle the command-line
interface.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<BuzzSaw>, buzzsaw-import(1)

=head1 PLATFORMS

This is the list of platforms on which we have tested this
software. We expect this software to work on any Unix-like platform
which is supported by Perl.
