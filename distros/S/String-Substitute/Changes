    Use cross product of sets instead of Regexp::Genex.
    A crash happened inside Regexp::Genex when I integrated this module into a larger package.
      unexpected token '(' during '' at /opt/perl-5.20.2/lib/site_perl/5.20.3/Regexp/Genex.pm line 455.
    I don't know what caused it, but it's scared me off Regexp::Genex for now.
    I think the new code is cleaner anyway.
