DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Mac::PropertyList - Only required when reading/writing an Apple ".webloc" shortcut.

The "t/samples" folder contains samples from the following repository:
  http://github.com/beckus/WebShortcutSamples
  Notes: - Files with unicode in their names have been renamed to avoid issues with
           unpacking in Windows.
         - The files beginning with dots have also been removed (in the webloc folder)

I chose not to use a Git submodule for this - Github does not
include the submodule when creating the downloadable tar/zip file.
If the WebShortcutSamples repository is updated, the changes
need to be manually applied in the local folder.
Sample files that contain unicode (as well as special characters)
have been omitted from the MANIFEST file.  This prevents warnings
when building on a system with limited support for unicode.
