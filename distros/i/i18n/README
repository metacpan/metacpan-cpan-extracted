NAME
    i18n - Perl Internationalization Pragma

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.10 of i18n, released October 14, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
    In one-liners:

        % export LANG=sp
        % perl -Mi18n=/path/to/po-files/ -le 'print ~~"Hello, world"';
        Hola, mundo

    In your module:

        use i18n "/path/to/po-files";
        my $place = ~~'world';
        print ~~"Hello, $world";

DESCRIPTION
    Internationalization (abbreviated "i18n") is the process of designing an
    application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions.
    The most basic task is to let your program know which strings are meant
    for human consumption and which strings are intended for the computer.

    Strings for humans need to get localized (translated to the language of
    the human using your program) and strings for computers must not get
    translated.

  Syntax
    The "i18n" module gives you a remarkably simple way to mark strings that
    are intended for humans. All you do is put two tilde signs ("~~") in
    front of every string that is intended to be translated. That's it. All
    the other details of localization are handled outside the program. Here
    are some examples:

        my $str1 = ~~'The time is now';
        my $str2 = ~~"$str1 for having a cow";
        my $str3 = ~~qq{Wow! $str2};
        my $str4 = ~~<<END;
        How now.
        Brown cow.
        END

    Think of the tilde signs as an indicator that you are looking for things
    that approximates the string in the user's language. To turn off the
    magic of "~~" lexically, just say:

        no i18n;

    One nice thing about this particular markup, is that you can completely
    turn off internationalization, by simply removing the "use i18n;"
    statement. The "~~" signs are actually valid Perl that just happen to
    not do anything in this context, and thus are constant-optimized away at
    compile time.

  Implementation
    When you say:

        my $string = ~~"Bob is your uncle";

    then $string really is an "i18n::string" object that is overloaded to
    stringify as a localized translation.

    Currently, the magic is just a thin wrapper on
    "Locale::Maketext::Simple", which makes it equivalent to this call:

        my $string = loc("Bob is your uncle");

    Similarly, this line:

        my $string = ~~"$person is your uncle";

    will be turned into this at runtime:

        my $string = loc("[_1] is your uncle", $person);
