Config/IniSearch version 0.03
=============================

This module provides a wrapper class for Config::IniHash to allow the
user to select different INI files at runtime without the need to
modify scripts that access the INI file parameters.  For instance, a
developer working with a production script can run with a development
INI file independent from a user who is also using the production
script, but with a "global" INI file suitable for production.  This
eliminates the need to create two or more copies of a script for the
sole purpose of modifying configuration parameters within the script.

This is a "true" wrapper class in that all options not specific to
this module are passed unmodified to Config::IniHash.  It is not a
subclass, however, of Config::IniHash in that it does not add
functionality to Config::IniHash.  This module simply provides the
user of Config::IniHash with the added convenience of being able to
manage multiple INI files for a given application.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (see TEST NOTES below)
   make install

TEST NOTES

Tests 1, 6, and 7 will fail unless you also copy the following files
to /etc (read-only access is sufficient):

    t/global.ini.etc => /etc/global.ini
    t/testSection.ini.etc => /etc/testSection.ini

Version 2.4 of Config::IniHash generates a run-time warning running
under 'strict' (the default when you run 'make test').  The warning
itself does not affect the results of the tests, but if it bothers you,
feel free to apply the included patch to you copy of IniHash.pm:

    patch -p0 < IniHash-2.4.patch
