  - Fix merge from feature branch to main branch

1.00 2025-08-15
  Note : multiple breaking changes to the framework plugin class in this version
  - get_valid_identity() replaces get_stored_identity(), get_stored_identity() still exists but returns the stored identity even if the identity has expired
  - New classes OIDC::Client::Identity and OIDC::Client::AccessToken
  - has_expired(), has_scope(), get_identity_expiration_time() and has_access_token_expired() methods have been moved to these new classes
  - get_valid_identity() and get_stored_identity() now return an OIDC::Client::Identity object
  - verify_token() and get_valid_access_token() now return an OIDC::Client::AccessToken object
  - New methods for framework plugins : store_access_token(), get_stored_access_token() and delete_stored_data()
  - The 'store_mode' configuration entry has been moved to the provider level. Its value can be different between providers
