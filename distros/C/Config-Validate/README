NAME
    Config::Validate - Validate data structures generated from configuration
    files. (Or anywhere else)

VERSION
    Version 0.2.6

DESCRIPTION
    This module is for validating configuration data that has been read in
    already and is in a Perl data structure. It does not handle reading or
    parsing configuration files since there are a plethora of available
    modules on CPAN to do that task. Instead it concentrates on verifying
    that the data read is correct, and providing defaults where appropriate.
    It also allows you to specify that a given configuration key may be
    available under several aliases, and have those renamed to the canonical
    name automatically.

    The basic model used is that the caller provides a schema as a perl data
    structure that describes the constraints to verify against. The caller
    can then use the "Config::Validate" object to validate any number of
    data structures against the configured schema. If the data structure
    conforms to the schema given, then a new data structure will be
    returned, otherwise an exception is thrown.

    Probably the easiest way to explain the intent is that
    "Config::Validate" is trying to be like "Params::Validate" for
    configuration files and other data structures.

    This module has the following features:

    * Data structure depth is only limited by stack depth
    * Can provide defaults for missing items at any level of the data
    structure.
    * Can require that items exist, or items can be optional.
    * Can validate items in the data structure against a number of built in
    data types, and users can easily add more data types.
    * Configuration keys can be known by several names, and will be
    normalized to the canonical name in the data structure returned by the
    validation.

SCHEMA DEFINITION
    The most complex part of using "Config::Validate" is defining the schema
    to validate against. The schema takes the form of set of nested hashes.

    Here is an example schema you might use if you were writing something
    that needs to validate a database connection configuration file.

      my $schema = { db => { 
                        type => 'nested',
                        alias => 'dbinfo',
                        child => { 
                           hostname => { 
                              type => 'hostname'
                              alias => [ qw(host server) ],
                              default => 'localhost,
                           },
                           port => { 
                              type => 'integer',
                              max => 64*1024 - 1,
                              min => 1,
                              default => '3306',
                           },
                           username => { 
                              type => 'string'
                              optional => 1,
                              alias => 'user',
                           },
                           password => { 
                              type => 'string',
                              optional => 1,
                              alias => [ qw(pass passwd) ],
                           },
                           database => {
                              type => 'string',
                              alias => 'dbname',
                           },
                           column_types => {
                              type => 'hash',
                              keytype => 'string',
                              child => {
                                id => { 
                                   type => 'string',
                                   default => 'INT',
                              },
                           },
                        },
                     allowed_users => {
                        type => 'array',
                        subtype => 'string',
                     },
                  };

    This is a somewhat long example of what a schema can look like. This
    uses most of the features available. The basic format is that a schema
    consists of a hash of hashes. Each of it's children describe a single
    field in the data structure to be validated. The only required key in
    the field definition is "type", which defines how that element in the
    data/config hash should be validated.

  VALIDATION TYPES
    Below is a list of the built in validation types, and the options they
    take. There are several global options that any of these can take that
    are documented below.

   nested
    The "nested" type provides a way to validate nested hash references.
    Valid options are:

    * child Hash reference that defines all the valid keys and values in the
            nested section. Required.

   integer
    The "integer" type expects a whole number that can be positive or
    negative. Valid options are:

    * min   Smallest valid value

    * max   Largest valid value

   float
    The "float" type verifies that the value meets the "looks_like_number"
    test from Scalar::Util. Valid options are:

    * min   Smallest valid value

    * max   Largest valid value

   string
    The "string" type does no validation if no addition restrictions are
    specified. Valid options are:

    * min   Minimum length

    * max   Maximum length

    * regex String must match the regex provided.

   boolean
    The "boolean" type looks for a number of specific values, and converts
    them to 0 or 1. The values considered to be true are: 1, "y", "yes",
    "t", "true" and "on". The values considered to be false are 0, "n",
    "no", "f", "false", "off". These values are not case sensitive. The
    "boolean" type takes no options.

   directory
    The "directory" type verifies that the value is a directory that exists.
    The "directory" type takes no options.

   file
    The "file" type verifies that the value is a file, or a symlink that
    points at a file that exists. The "file" type takes no options.

   domain
    The "domain" type uses the Data::Validate::Domain "is_domain" function
    to verify that the value is a validate domain name. This does not look
    the value up in DNS and verify that it exists. The "domain" type takes
    no options.

   hostname
    The "hostname" type uses the Data::Validate::Domain "is_hostname"
    function to verify that the value is a validate hostname name. This does
    not look the value up in DNS and verify that it exists. The "hostname"
    type takes no options.

   array
    The "array" type verifies that the value is an array reference. If the
    "array_allows_scalar" option is turned on (it is by default), then if a
    scalar value is found, then it will automatically be converted to an
    array reference with a single element.

    * subkey
            Required option that specifies the type of the elements of the
            array.

   hash
    The "hash" type validates a hash reference of key/value pairs.

    * keytype
            Required option that specifies the type of validation to do on
            hash keys

    * child If the "hash" type finds a "child" option, then it will validate
            any keys in the hash against the fields in the "child"
            definition. Note that it is NOT an error if elements are found
            in the hash that are not in child. If you want that behavior,
            you should use the "nested" type instead.

  COMMON OPTIONS
    There are a set of options that can be added to any field definition,
    that provide a common set of functionality to all.

    * alias The "alias" option allows you to specify other names that a
            particular field might be known by. For example, you may have a
            field named "password", but also want to accept "pass", "passwd"
            and "pw". If any of the aliases are found, then they will be
            renamed in the data structure that is returned by "validate".
            This option can point to a scalar, or an array reference.

    * callback
            The "callback" option allows you to specify a callback that will
            be called after any other validation has been done for a
            specific field in the data structure. The callback sub is called
            with a reference to the "Config::Validate" object (one is
            created automatically if you're using the functional interface),
            the value to be verified, the definition of the field, and an
            array reference containing the path into the data structure. You
            can use the "mkpath" method to convert the path to a more
            readable form for error messages and such.

    * default
            The "default" option allows you to specify a default for the
            field. This implicitly means the field is not required to exist
            in the data structure being validated. As many levels as
            necessary will be created in the resulting data structure to
            insure the default is created.

    * optional
            If the "optional" option is true, then the field is not
            required. If "optional" is false, or not defined, then the field
            is required.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    The new method constructs a "Config::Validate" object, and returns it.
    It accepts the following arguments:

    * schema
            A validation schema as described in the "SCHEMA DEFINITION"
            section above.

    * data_path
            If this is set to true, and the "Data::Path" module is
            available, then the "validate" method/function will encapsulate
            the results returned in a "Data::Path" instance. Defaults to
            false;

    * data_path_options
            If the "data_path" option is true, then this should be a hash
            reference to be passed in as the second argument to the
            "Data:Path" constructor.

    * array_allows_scalar
            If this is true, then scalars will be autopromoted to a single
            element array reference when validating "array" types.

    * debug Enables debugging output.

    * on_debug
            Allows you to define a callback for debugging output. A default
            callback will be provided if this isn't set. The default
            callback simply prints the debug output to STDOUT. If you set
            the callback, then will be called with the object as the first
            parameter, and the additional parameters should be joined to
            form the entire message.

    In addition, any of these can read or changed after the object is
    created, via an accessor with the same name as the parameter.

  validate
    The validate sub can be called as either a function, or as a instance
    method.

    If it is called as an instance method, then it expects a single "config"
    parameter which should be the data structure/config to be validated.

      my $result = $obj->validate(config => $config)

    If it is called as a function, then it accepts two parameters. The
    "config" parameter should be the data structure/config to be validated,
    and the "schema" parameter should be the schema.

      my $result = validate(config => $config, schema => $schema)

    The "config" parameter above can be a hash reference, or it can be a
    "Config::General" object. If it is a "Config::General" object, then the
    validate sub will automatically call the "getall" method on the object.

    If any errors are encountered, then the validate sub will call die to
    throw an exception. In that case the value of $@ contain an error
    message describing the problem.

    There was formerly a one and two argument variant of this sub. It is
    still supported, but deprecated.

  add_type
    The "add_type" method allows you to register a validation type on just a
    single instance of "Config::Validate". The parameters are as follows:

    * name  This is the name to be specified in the schema to use this
            validation type. This is a mandatory parameter.

    * validate
            The value of "validate" should be a callback that will be run
            when it is necessary to validate a field of this type. The
            callback will be passed the "Config::Validate" object, the name
            of the field being validated, the schema definition of that
            field, and an array reference containing the path into the data
            structure. You can use the "mkpath" method to convert the path
            to a more readable form for error messages and such.

    * init  The value of "init" should be a callback that will be run before
            any validation is done. The callback will be passed the
            "Config::Validate" object, the schema, and the configuration
            being validated.

    * finish
            The value of "finish" should be a callback that will be run
            after any validation is done. The callback will be passed the
            "Config::Validate" object, the schema, and the configuration
            being validated.

  add_default_type
    The "add_default_type" method allows you to register a validation type
    for all new "Config::Validate" instances. It can be called as a
    function, class method, or instance method. If it is called as an
    instance method, then the new type will also be added to that instance.
    The parameters are the same as "add_type".

  reset_default_types
    The "reset_default_types" method removes all user defined types from the
    base class. Any instances that are alread created will retain their
    existing type configuration.

  mkpath
    This is a convenience function for people writing callbacks and user
    defined type validation. It takes either an array or array reference and
    returns a string that represents the path to a specific item in the
    configuration. This might be useful if you're interested in having your
    error messages be consistent with the rest of "Config::Validate". This
    is available for export, but not exported by default. Note: this is a
    function, not a method.
