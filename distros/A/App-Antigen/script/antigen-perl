=head1 NAME

antigen-perl - CLI plugin manager tool for Zsh

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # In ~/.zsh/config.yml
  plugins:
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-theme-steeef
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-settings-completion
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-plugin-extract
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-plugin-colored-man
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-plugin-tmux-simple

  # Elsewhere, in a shell near you...
  antigen-perl

  # and in your ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.antigen-perl/antigen-perl.sh

=head1 COMMANDS

The following commands are available on the command line

=over

=item (arguments)

The first argument is for specifying the config file. If this is not present,
it will default to ~/.zsh/config.yml:

  # use ~/.zsh/config.yml
  antigen-perl

  # be verbose
  antigen-perl ~/.zsh/config.yml

  # use a custom config place
  antigen-perl ~/.files/zsh/custom.yml

=item -o --output

This defines the directory to which all output files will be put. If this is the
only extra argument set, then the repos folder and output file will be under
this directory. This defaults to '~/.antigen-perl'.

=item -r --repo

This defines the directory to which the repos will be put. If this is not
defined then the directory will be '/repos' under the output directory.

=item -f --output_file

This defines the output file which will contain all the source and fpath calls
to the various plugins. defaults to 'antigen-perl.sh' under the output directory.

=head1 CONFIG

The config file can contain all of the following sections, although MUST
contain a 'plugin' section. This file is currently in YAML format, although
this may change in the future - although will likely be compatible with YAML
and more.

=over

=item plugins

This section is mandatory, although using a plugin manager without specifying
any plugins is sort of a silly idea, isnt it? this section also defines how the
plugin is stored - currently this only supports github, but it only needs the
username and repository name as shown below

  plugins:
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-theme-steeef
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-settings-completion
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-plugin-extract
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-plugin-colored-man
    - github: TBSliver/zsh-plugin-tmux-simple

=item output

This is the same option as is available with the command line, and specifies
the folder into which you can put all the repositories. To define it, set it as
follows

  output: /path/to/folder

This is optional, and if not set will default to '~/.antigen-perl'

=item repo

This is the same as is available with the command line, and specifies the
directory to which the repositories will be cloned. It can be set as follows

  repo: /path/to/folder

Note that if this is set, it will not be put inside the output folder, but to
the absolute path you pass to it.

=item output_file

This is the same as the option available on the command line, and specifies the
filename for the list of plugins to be 'sourced' inside. Set it as follows

  output_file: /path/to/file.sh

This is also the file which the application will tell you to source in your
~/.zshrc file.
