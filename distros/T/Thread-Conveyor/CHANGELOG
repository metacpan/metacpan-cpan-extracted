0.19    20 September 2010
	Checking tool chain with perl.5.13.5.

0.18	3 October 2007
	Hopefully fixed test-suite for none thread enabled Perls.  Updated
	to use new VERSION feature of Devel::Required.

0.17	7 January 2004
	Fixed some documentation inconsistencies.  Added documentation on what
	is different from Thread::Queue::Any.

	Made default optimization dependent on the version of Perl used.
	Added test for it.

	Removed mention of Storable: replaced it with Thread::Serialize.
	Added Thread::Serialize as a dependency, just for documentation sake
	really.

0.16	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

	Added dependency to load.pm.

0.15	9 November 2003
	A problem in (threaded) 5.8.2 made Thread::Conveyor segfault in the
	test-suite.  The problem was fortunately easy to circumvent: just don't
	use subroutines consisting of {} as an object method (in the case of
	Thread::Conveyor, the shutdown() method).

0.14	11 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Verified everything
	works with 5.8.1.  Updated dependency of Thread::Tie.

0.13	30 September 2002
	Use "load.pm" instead of AutoLoader.  Changed dependency on Thread::Tie
	to version 0.08 (which also uses load.pm).

	Added check for availability of methods again: load.pm does support
	that, whereas AutoLoader does not.

0.12	27 September 2002
	Ask found another problem in T::C::Tied::clean_dontwait.  Fixed.

	Also left warnings enabled in the test-suite last time, which caused
	warnings in the make test.  Changed code so that the warnings are not
	emitted anymore.

0.11	26 September 2002
	Fixed some warnings in T::C::Throttled, spotted by Ask Bjoern Hansen.

	Removed "our" from $VERSION and @ISA, should shave off some bytes in
	memory usage, as found from testing with Benchmark::Thread::Size.

0.10	1 September 2002
	Replaced dependency on Thread::Serialize by dependency on Thread::Tie
	as the default, memory optimized implementation, now uses Thread::Tie.

	Changed Thread::Conveyor so that it uses T::C::Tied for unthrottled
	belts when optimizing for memory.

	Changed T::C::Throttled so that it makes its own decision on which
	belt implementation to be used, either T::C::Array (optimized for
	CPU) or T::C::Tied (optimized for memory).

	Added "semaphore" object method to T::C::Array for obtaining the
	lock() semaphore, needed by T::C::Throttled.

	Removed T::C::Thread from the distribution.  This shaves about 1200
	bytes off of the distribution package.

	Replaced Thread::Conveyor::Thread by Thread::Conveyor::Tied, which
	uses Thread::Tie as its shared array implementation.  This has the
	side-effect to being almost twice as slow but saving 18% of
	memory (at least in the test-suite).  So there is now a true CPU
	versus memory trade-off.  Main difference in CPU is caused by the
	fact that whole array fetches aren't possible using the tie()
	interface (this is a loop with FETCH()), wherease T::C::Thread was
	optimized to deal with that case).  Main difference in memory is
	caused by the fact that only one thread (the Thread::Tie default
	thread) is used for all belts, whereas before each belt had its own
	thread.  So the savings in memory could in real world situations, be
	quite a lot more than the 18% seen in the test-suite.

0.09	30 August 2002
	Changed all modules to use AutoLoader to defer loading of necessary
	subroutines to when they are actually needed.  This should save
	memory and CPU for larger programs, or with large numbers of threads.
	The test-suite only marginally takes more memory at the same CPU
	usage: overhead of compiling is levelled out with the overhead of
	cloning pre-compiled routines.

0.08	20 August 2002
	Dave Mitchell showed me the error of my ways with regards to client
	server thread programming.  Fixed the handler optimized for memory so
	that no yield()s are necessary anymore.  The whole thing now gets
	through the test suite more than 25% faster for that part.
	Scalability to many more threads should now be a lot better too.

0.07	14 August 2002
	Removed (possibly premature) optimization from T::C::Thread
	_handler: it now doesn't zap the local threadspace anymore.

0.06	13 August 2002
	Handed over freezing and thawing operations to Thread::Serialize.
	Added dependency to Thread::Serialize in Makefile.PL.

0.05	6 August 2002
	Fixed "onbelt" in T::C::Thread so that it won't hang if the belt is
	shut down.  Needed for Thread::Pool and in general useful.

	5 August 2002
	Added index functionality to "peek" and "peek_dontwait" to all
	sub-classes and added documentation for it.  Needed for Thread::Pool.

	Finally got the T::C::Thread implementation getting through the
	test-suite reliably.  Problem was caused by my misconception that
	cond_wait would always regain the lock() after being signalled.  It
	does not.  This should have been in big red letters in the
	threads::shared pod.

	Added methods "shutdown", "thread" and "tid" plus documentation.

	3 August 2002
	Adapted test-suite to use many more combinations of possible
	settings.

	2 August 2002
	Added new "optimize" field parameter to allow you to select an
	implementation optimized for speed (T::C::Array and T::C::Throttled)
	or for memory (T::C::Thread).

	Added new implementation of Thread::Conveyor based on using a
	seperate thread for keeping the belt: Thread::Conveyor::Thread.

	Move basic parts of Thread::Conveyor to Thread::Conveyor::Array.
	Which should allow for other implementations of the conveyor
	metaphor.

0.04    1 August 2002
	Added internal method "_belt" to get at the actual belt, for both
	the normal and the throttled belt.

0.03	31 July 2002
	Added internal methods "_freeze" and "_thaw" so that we can move
	to a different serialization scheme or other optimizations without
	having to change all the sub-classes as well.  First user is
	Thread::Conveyor::Monitored.

	Added "maxjobs" and "minjobs" method in Thread::Conveyor that will
	die when they're called (throttling only takes place in
	Thread::Conveyor::Throttled).

	Fixed problem that would cause throttling to not be switched off
	when the "maxjobs" method was specified with an undef value.

	Added methods "clean" and "clean_dontwait" for cleaning the belt
	to both Thread::Conveyor and Thread::Conveyor::Throttled.  Also
	added documentation for it.

	Added internal method "_clean" for obtaining frozen contents of
	the belt to both Thread::Conveyor and Thread::Conveyor::Throttled.
	This was needed for Thread::Conveyor::Monitored.

0.02	30 July 2002
	Adapted Thread::Conveyor to default to a throttled conveyor belt
	automatically if no specific parameters specified.  Now allows for
	specification of throttling settings in a parameter hash reference.
	If unthrottling is specifically specified, returns to the old
	unthrottled behaviour (where the object is just an array reference),
	thus keeping the old execution speed.

	Added helper class Thread::Conveyor::Throttled to allow for throttled
	conveyor belts that block if there are too many boxes on the belt.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

0.01	25 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Conveyor, which started life as
	Thread::Queue::Any.
