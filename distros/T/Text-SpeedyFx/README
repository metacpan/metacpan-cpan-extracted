SYNOPSIS

        use Data::Dumper;
        use Text::SpeedyFx;
    
        my $sfx = Text::SpeedyFx->new;
    
        my $words_bag = $sfx->hash('To be or not to be?');
        print Dumper $words_bag;
        #$VAR1 = {
        #          '1422534433' => '1',
        #          '4120516737' => '2',
        #          '1439817409' => '2',
        #          '3087870273' => '1'
        #        };
    
        my $feature_vector = $sfx->hash_fv("thats the question", 8);
        print unpack('b*', $feature_vector);
        # 01001000

DESCRIPTION

    XS implementation of a very fast combined parser/hasher which works
    well on a variety of bag-of-word problems.

    Original implementation
    <http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2008/HPL-2008-91R1.pdf> is in Java
    and was adapted for a better Unicode compliance.

METHODS

 new([$seed, $bits])

    Initialize parser/hasher, can be customized with the options:

    $seed

      Hash seed (default: 1).

    $bits

      How many bits do represent one character. The default value, 8,
      sacrifices Unicode handling but is fast and low on memory footprint.
      The value of 18 encompasses Basic Multilingual, Supplementary
      Multilingual and Supplementary Ideographic planes. See also "UNICODE
      SUPPORT"

 hash($octets)

    Parses $octets and returns a hash reference (not exactly; see "CAVEAT")
    where keys are the hashed tokens and values are their respective count.
    $octets are assumed to represent UTF-8 string unless Text::SpeedyFx is
    instantiated with "$bits" == 8 (which forces Latin-1 mode, see "UNICODE
    SUPPORT"). Note that this is the slowest form due to the
    (computational) complexity of the associative array
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array> data structure
    itself: hash_fv()/hash_min() variants are up to 260% faster!

 hash_fv($octets, $n)

    Parses $octets and returns a feature vector (string of bits) with
    length $n. $n is supposed to be a multiplier of 8, as the length of the
    resulting feature vector is ceil($n / 8). See the included utilities
    cosine_cmp and uniq_wc.

 hash_min($octets)

    Parses $octets and returns the hash with the lowest value. Useful in
    MinHash <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash> implementation. See also
    the included minhash_cmp utility.

UNICODE SUPPORT

    Due to the nature of Perl, Unicode support is handled differently from
    the original implementation. By default, Text::SpeedyFx recognizes
    UTF-8 encoded code points in the range 00000-2FFFF:

      * Plane 0, the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, 0000–FFFF)

      * Plane 1, the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP, 10000–1FFFF)

      * Plane 2, the Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP, 20000–2FFFF)

      * There are planes up to 16; however, as in Perl v5.16.2, there are
      no code points matching isALNUM_utf8() there (so it's irrelevant for
      proper algorithm operation).

    Although, there is a major drawback: in this mode, each instance
    allocates up to 1 MB of memory.

    If the application doesn't need to support code points beyond the Plane
    0 (like the original SpeedyFx implementation) it is possible to
    constraint the address space to 16 bits, which lowers memory allocation
    to up to 256 KB. In fact, Text::SpeedyFx constructor accepts bit range
    between 8 and 18 to address code points.

 LATIN-1 SUPPORT

    8 bit address space has one special meaning: it completely disables
    multibyte support. In 8 bit mode, each instance will only allocate 256
    bytes and hashing will run up to 340% faster! Tokenization will
    fallback to ISO 8859-1 West European languages (Latin-1) character
    definitions.

BENCHMARK

    The test platform configuration:

      * Intel® Xeon® E5620 CPU @ 2.40GHz (similar to the one cited in the
      reference paper);

      * Debian 6.0.6 (Squeeze, 64-bit);

      * Perl v5.16.1 (installed via perlbrew);

      * enwik8 from the Large Text Compression Benchmark
      <https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/text.html>.

    All the tests except the ones with _utf8 suffix were made in Latin-1
    mode. For comparison, murmur_utf8 was implemented using
    Digest::MurmurHash hasher and native regular expression tokenizer:

        ++$fv->{murmur_hash(lc $1)}
            while $data =~ /(\w+)/gx;

    See also the eg/benchmark.pl script.

CAVEAT

    For performance reasons, hash() method returns a tied hash which is an
    interface to nedtries
    <http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedtries/>. The interesting
    property of a trie data structure <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie>
    is that the keys are "nearly sorted" (and the first key is guaranteed
    to be the lowest), so:

        # This:
        $fv = $sfx->hash($data);
        ($min) = each %$fv;
        # Is the same as this:
        ($min) = $sfx->hash_min($data);
        # (albeit the later being 2x faster)

    The downside is the magic involved, the delete breaking the key order,
    and the memory usage. The hardcoded limit is 524288 unique keys per
    result, which consumes ~25MB of RAM on a 64-bit architecture. Exceeding
    this will croak with the message "too many unique tokens in a single
    data chunk". The only way to raise this limit is by recompilation of
    the XS module:

        perl Makefile.PL DEFINE=-DMAX_TRIE_SIZE=2097152
        make
        make test
        make install
