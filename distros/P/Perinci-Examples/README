DESCRIPTION

    This distribution contains an odd mix of various functions, variables,
    and other code entities, along with their Rinci metadata. Mostly used
    for testing Rinci specification and the various Perinci modules.

    Example scripts are put in a separate distribution (see
    Perinci::Examples::Bin) to make dependencies for this distribution
    minimal (e.g. not depending on Perinci::CmdLine::Any) since this
    example module(s) are usually used in the tests of other modules.
