0.018
 - Properly handle open and sysopen file handles going out of scope.
 - Provide a helper method to mock objects to determine the file name. GH #31
 - Do not throw a file access hook when statting a file handle that is not under MockFile control. GH #30

0.014   12/20/2018
 - Re-factor _find_file_or_fh to handle symlink following logic better. GH #26
 - Make more standard use of _get_file_object when looking up a file path so we
   properly handle abs path and symlink following

0.013   12/20/2018

 - Remove faulty OS level test of readdir after opendir.

0.011   11/08/2018
 - Fix for my $file_contents = do { local $/; <$fh> };
 - Mock CORE::GLOBAL::unlink and support directories for unlink
 - Mock CORE::GLOBAL::mkdir
 - Mock CORE::GLOBAL::rmdir
 - MockFile->symlink now follows the symlink norm of ($target, $file), not the reverse.
 - New mock helper 'exists' to check if the file is there.
 - New mock helper 'permissions' tells you the current permissions of the mocked file.

0.010   10/31/2018
 - Add .perltidyrc policy
 - When reporting strict mode violations, be sure to report the a stack location outside of our modules.
 - Report a stack trace for strict mode violations to determine the source of the problem.
 - Add an ignore hash for modules (like DynaLoader) which are allowed to open files.
 - Ignore STDIN/STDERR/STDOUT since tests often have to manipulate them and that's not really IO.
 - Autovivify a sysread where the buffer passed in is undef.

0.009   10/29/2018
 - Add unlink and touch as helpers when testing
 - Depend on new Overload::FileCheck 0.006 which does not call MockFile to determine _ stats

0.008   10/26/2018
 - Depend on newest Overload::FileCheck version. Depending on older
   versions was breaking unit tests.

0.007   10/25/2018
 - More POD fixups
 - Support for unmocked file access hooks.
 - Implement strict mode to error any time an unmocked file access happens.

0.006   10/25/2018
 - Fix for Locale-dependent failures on perl < 5.22
     https://github.com/CpanelInc/Test-MockFile/issues/10

   Fixes https://github.com/CpanelInc/Test-MockFile/issues/6
   
0.003   10/24/2018
 - Correct bug in use constant statement. 0.002 was broken on release.
 - Changes to code to give basic support for Perl 5.10+. Ideally you should be on
    perl 5.16 to run this code but it'll mostly work below that.

0.002   10/24/2018
 - Set bug tracker to github
 - Fix Fcntl bug when you use unsupported constants.

0.001   10/23/2018

    Error:  Invalid CODE attribute: prototype(*;$@) at lib/Test/MockFile.pm
