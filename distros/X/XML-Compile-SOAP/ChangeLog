	  rt.cpan.org#42528 [Piotr Roszatycki]

	- do not use /bin/pwd in t/99pod.t

	. split-off SOAP12 into distribution XML::Compile::SOAP12
	. the "document" style soap interface unchanged.
	. rpc-literal is much better now, like document style
	. rpc-encoded not yet supported.
	. pluggable back-ends for message structures (SOAP1.1, SOAP1.2,..)
	  and transporters (SOAPHTTP, XMPP, ...)

	Changes:

	- Too many changes in internals to detail.

	- you have to explicitly load XML::Compile::SOAP11 yourself, to
	  have those definitions understood by the WSDL.

	Fixes:

	- fixed t/30charset.t, with double encode of utf-8.

	Improvements:

	- port to Perl pre-5.8.3, working around broken or non-existing
	  encode() [Toby Corkindale]

	- report cause on client error which is produced in LWP [Tom]

	- removed the [new in 0.78] added elementFormDefault="qualified"
	  in favor of the new XML::Compile::Schema::importDefinitions()
	  options which do the same.

	- more trace messages.

	- new examples for rpc-literal, based on Daniel Ruoso's example.

version 0.78: Fri Oct 10 15:55:39 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- improved understanding of top-level elements in XML::Compile 0.95
	  broke this module:
	  . some schema lack    elementFormDefault="qualified"
	    changed in soap-encoding.xsd, wsdl-soap.xsd
	  . some problems in the RPC encoder/decoder
	  . disable t/51wsdl11enc.t

	Fixes:

	- Correcting fault handling. Code and tests(!) contributed
	  by [Jamie Lentin]

	- Requires XML::Compile 0.91, just because it is much better.

version 0.75: Mon Jul 21 09:17:10 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Requires XML::Compile 0.90. Cpantesters [Martin Kutter]

	Fixes:

	- Reading SOAP failed, because improved strictness of XML::Compile
	  [Jason Tang]

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile 0.87, which renames option output_namespaces
	  into prefixes.

	  t/TestTools.t

version 0.72: Wed Apr 16 13:03:26 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- WSDL schemata passed to new() got parsed twice.

	- schema sources were offered for compilation twice, but ignored

	  as was documented [Allan Wind]

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.73 -> 0.78

	  The related test needs to be updated (print cannot handle byte-
	  streams)

	- Client does not add Content-Length field. Patch [Drew Taylor]

	- headers were missing, since XML::Compile "reader in list-context"
	  fix.  Reported by [Gert Doering]

	Fixes:

	- Math::BigInt with GMP caused t/14dec11.t to fail
	  [CPANTesters, Slaven Rezic]

version 0.69: Tue Apr  8 23:48:31 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Trace returned on error was not transformed into an object, and
	  resulted in unwanted undefs.

	- ::Trace->printTimings() did not handle undefs well.

	- Document that SOAPHTTP::compileClient(action) is optional, not
	  required

	- ::SOAPHTTP will use LWP::UserAgent with Keep-Alive on.

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile 0.69 -> 0.73

	- ::WSDL11::Operation canTransport() implementation was broken,
	  and therefore needed a change of behavior.  Probably invisible
	  for end-users.

	  with the same endpoint(s).

	- New method ::SOAP::messageStructure()

	- New facility method ::SOAP::importDefinitions()

	Fixes:

	- WSDL types were compiled twice.

	- problems with specifying your own transporter when creating SOAP

	- upgrade requirement XML::Compile to 0.68

	- ::Encoding::dec()  [decode RPC] tries harder.
	  with help of [Philippe B.]

	Improvements:

	- Pass information about location of type definitions to
	  XML::Compile, for debugging and tracing.

	- ::Encoding::array new option array_type

version 0.66: Thu Jan 31 09:30:18 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- the SOAP message is a document, not an element.  This way,
	  we get the right output encoding for free.  Problem spotted
	  by [Gert Doering]

	- more encoding/decoding character-set issues.  Test script
	  in t/30charset.t

	Improvements:

	- details about client-side soap moved from ::SOAP into
	  ::SOAP::Client

	- ::SOAP::compileClient() moved to ::SOAP::Client::

	Changes:

	- various improvements in the output of Encode::decSimplify(),
	  the automatic decoded rpc-encoded messages.

	- depends on XML::Compile 0.61

	Fixes:

	- ::Encoding::_dec_typed() confused URI and prefix.

	- rpc-encoded now tests that user's constructed question has
	  a name-space.

	Improvements:

	- updated examples in example/namesservice/
	  WSDL example is now called: has_wsdl.pl

	- added new example/namesservices examples:
	  New pure Schema example: has_schema.pl
	  RPC-literal example: rpc-literal.pl
	  RPC-Encoded example: rpc-encoded.pl
	  and 4 related simplifications, named xxxx2.pl

	- added for convenience: Encoding::encAddNamespace() [without s]

version 0.63: Sat Nov 24 00:14:07 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.60

	- ::Encode::typed() now uses selected schemaNS as default, so
	  simplifies the type parameter.

	- ::Encode::element() now also has the 'type' as first parameter,
	  like ::typed().

	Fixes:

	- detection of operation type, where WSDL used prefixes.

	- some improvements and changes where not listed in the changelog
	  for version 0.62

	Changes:

	- XML::Compile::SOAP::HTTPClient renamed into
	  XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP.
	  It is reworked to extend the new XML::Compile::Transport.
	  Change invisible to WSDL users, but very visible to people
	  who create their own messages.  Some of the trace records
	  changed name as well.

	- swapped arguments of ::Encoding::typed() from
	   (name, type, value) to (type, name, value);

	- WSDL11(::Operation)::prepareClient() renamed into
	  ::compileClient()

	Improvements:

	- moved README.todo text to XML::Compile::SOAP man-page,
	  because people often use pre-packaged modules and therefore
	  may not see the README files.

	- extended the documentation a lot.

	- implemented XML::Compile::SOAP::compileClient(), which was
	  documented but not present.

	- added transport base class XML::Compile::Transport.

	  not understood by Perl 5.5 [Slaven Rezic]

version 0.55: Wed Oct  3 22:57:24 CEST 2007

	- first attempt on a full implementation.  Quite some
	  interface changes were made; old docs are useless.
