0.16
 - Work around perl bug in https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19550

0.15
 - Fix bug re inconsistent settings of POK and NOK flag, which manifests itself as (eg):
   http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/dc17e330-900b-11ec-bfc9-d1f1448276d4
   It's a bug that rarely bites, and applies mainly (but not only) to perl-5.18.x and
   earlier.
 - In the Makefile.PL, do not re-insert stripped '-lm' or '-lquadmath' on
   Windows as this won't ever achieve the desired result on that OS. (Right ??)

0.14
 - Fix https://github.com/sisyphus/math-decimal64/pull/1 (also aplies to Math::Float128)
   Thanks to @hiratara
 - tweak the alignment conditions in math_float128_include.h to exclude
   alignment directives for 32-bit mingw-w64 compilers

0.13
 - Prototype subroutines listed in 'use subs()'.
 - Move pod from Float128.pm to (newly created) Float128.pod.
 - Add fromSTR(), fromNV(), fromIV() and fromUV().
 - corrections to t/03arith.t and t/13constants.t.
   ( See https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132376 )

0.12
 - Fix typo ("Reinsterting") in Makefile.PL
 - In Float128.xs fix alignment issue that arises on some -DDEBUGGING builds
 - Attend to overloading of POK/NOK dualvars

0.11
 - Replace SvUV/SvIV/SvNV with SvUVX/SvIVX/SvNVX where appropriate. (In typemap, too.)
 - Add code to Makefile.PL to ensure that '-lquadmath' doesn't get stripped
   (Thanks to kent frederic.)

0.10
 - Fix overloading of comparison operators (for when operands are reversed).

0.09
 - Change default ouptut precision to 36 - which brings it into line with the mpfr
   library.

0.08
 - In t/11stringification.t add a test to check that F128toSTR is, in fact, not
   outputting insane values.
 - Fix the problem that necessitated the addition of that F128toSTR test. For
   defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(__MINGW64__)
   we now:
   typedef __float128 float128 __attribute__ ((aligned(32)));
   instead of simply:
   typedef __float128 float128;

0.07
 - Allow for MinGW64-v4 (runtime) bugfixes in Float128.xs.

0.06
 - Have the Makefile.PL perform a test that works around the brokenness of
   Bingos' NetBSD smoker(s).
 - Add nnumflag(), set_nnum() and clear_nnum() functions. Also check for
   non-numeric strings handed to strtoflt128()..

0.05
 - Allow UV, IV, NV and PV overloading, and alter accordingly the way that new() assigns
   these types.

0.04
 - Add metadata to Makefile.PL.
 - Add f128_bytes()
 - Add extra quadmath.h functions
 - Add typemap

0.03
 - Fix t/03arith.t, t/05cmp.t, t/08log_exp.t, t/11stringification.t, and t/13constants.t
   to accommodate the possibility that the locale in use represents the decimal point
   with a comma.

0.02
 - mingw64 compilers segfault on exp(). For these compilers we now have _overload_exp()
   do e ** arg instead of doing exp(arg).
 - Add constants defined in quadmath.h - and add t/13constants.t to check them.
 - Define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT.

0.01
 - First release
