ghmulti - Helps when using multiple Github accounts with SSH keys


=head1 SYNOPSIS

   ghmulti [ -c GITHUB_URL [DIR] | -u [GITHUB_URL] ]
   ghmulti --help | --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script helps when using multiple Github accounts with SSH keys. First,
you should read this gist
L<https://gist.github.com/oanhnn/80a89405ab9023894df7> and follow the
instructions.

B<Note>: this script uses the B<git> command line tool, so B<git> must be
installed and available via C<PATH>.

To use this script, you need to add information in file F<~/.ssh/config> by
adding comments like this:

   Host github-foo
   #  User: John Doe <jd@foomail.com>
      HostName github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/foo
      IdentitiesOnly yes

   Host github-bar
   #  User: Mr. Smith <somename@blahmail.org> <ignored@mail> IGNORED STUFF
      HostName github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bar
      IdentitiesOnly yes

   Host github-baz
   #  User: <abc@blubb.eu>
      HostName github.com
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/baz
      IdentitiesOnly yes

The script looks for C<Host> names beginning with C<github->. It assumes that
the part after the hyphen is your username on github. E.g., in the example
above the gibthub usernames are C<foo>, C<bar> and C<baz>.

The next line must be a comment line beginning with C<User:> followed by an
optional name (full name, may contain spaces) followed by an email address in
angle brackets (a second email address and a string may follow, but they are
ignored by this script). The script uses this data like this:

  git config user.email EMAIL
  git config user.name  FULLNAME

If you did not specify a full name, the script uses your github user name instead.

These are the variants of how you can use the script:

=over

=item * Without any arguments

If you are in a git repo, the script sets the remote URL to use the SSH key
and configures the email address and the username as described above.
Otherwise the script terminates with an error state.

=item * C<-c GITHUB_URL [DIR]>

Checks whether the user name is in F<~/.ssh/config>. If this is not the case,
the script aborts with an error message. Otherwise it works like C<git clone>,
but also configures the repo as described above.

=item * C<-u [GITHUB_URL]>

Prints the github URL in the format needed to use your SSH keys. If
I<C<GITHUB_URL>> is not specified, the script attempts to determine a URL via
C<git remote get-url origin>.

With this option, the script does not an configuration.

=back

Note: the options C<-c> and C<-u> are mutually exclusive!
