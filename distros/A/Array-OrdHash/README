Array-OrdHash
==========================

Array::OrdHash behaves as a hash reference and an array reference simultaneously, just like MS Collection object or PHP Array.
It is ordered, in other words, it preserves the order in which its elements were added. 
You are not to call `tie` function, you simple call the `Array::OrdHash->new()` constructor and then you can manipulate with the variable of this class just like with a Perl hash reference or with an Perl array reference - as it is more suitable for you. You can also perform all built-in Perl array and hash functions on a variable of this class.

It is especially useful for database data fetching and further manipulating. Some additional methods supply some additional services.
