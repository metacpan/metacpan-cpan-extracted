Here is my list of things to do in a random descending list of priority.

* FIX THE MEMORY LEAK! (Probably in virtual functions)

* Get rid of Qt::Hash and replace with something reasonable.

* require 5.004;

* Add comments to examples

* fix extract_ptr()!!! Perhaps by making THIS a hash with type-names as
elements? Perhaps also allowing multiple-inheritance? Hey, just a thought.

* Change all extract_ptr()'s to pextract()'s

* Add tests to check whether THIS and DELETE are valid.

* Allow more data-types to be passed as arguments to signals/slots
and do minimal argument parsing.

* Get the typemap to read from className and convert to THAT type, not the
one requested

* Find the NULLs and make sure XSRETURN_UNDEF is called to bypass the
typemap conversion!

* Check for undef in the arguments and/or in the typemaps?

* Write a QGlobal::import() that will only initialize enum values if
they are requested by a module.

* Incorporate operator overloading into QSize/QRect and friends.

* Create a pembed

* Add tests

* Clean up the enumeration/constant interface.

* Compile everything as one library, and see if there is any benefit.

* Allow connections to closure slots.

* Arbitrary argument-lists (...) between Perl signals and Perl slots.

* Ditch libperlqt and include the functionality into QGlobal after I
figure out how to get the bootstraps in the other modules to look
in QGlobal.

* Perhaps split up virtualize and setup a virtual override inheritance tree?

* Make libperlqt more generic, so as to support other scripting languages?

* Overloaded signals/slots

* Rewrite the whole thing in SWIG, to allow all the other scripting
languages in the world to bask in the glory of PerlQt.
