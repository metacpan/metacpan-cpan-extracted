Revision history for Geo::Routing (previously Geo::Gosmore)

0.11 2011-07-29 07:09:19

    - Alter the OSRM query_string method to use the json protocol by
      default.

0.10 2011-07-28 11:35:27

    - Support both XML and JSON query methods to OSRM for debugging

    - Use keep-alive with Mechanize

    - More robust tests

0.09 2011-07-26 22:57:34

    - Switch from XML parsing for OSRM to using JSON::XS. Eliminates
      the entire need for parsing things, and makes things faster.

0.08 2011-06-30 12:12:09

    - Use my own ad-hoc regexp powered XML parser instead of
      XML::Simple by default. This cut down cpu time in production
      from 40% per process to 5%.

    - Use curl instead of WWW::Mechanize. Makes it easier to see which
      process is waiting for what in top(1).
