WWW::URLToys 1.28 Release

Install this the standard way, using:

---

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

---

WWW::URLToys requires the following modules:

Exporter
LWP
HTTP::Cookies
URI::URL
Term::ReadLine
MIME::Base64
Cwd

Most of the time, installing LWP and Term::ReadLine from CPAN
will finish a regular distribution's setup enough to get all
of these available to you.
