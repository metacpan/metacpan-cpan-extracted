Archive-Tar-Stream

This module was previously known as ME::TarStream and created
as part of the backup system at FastMail.FM a few years ago.

RATIONALE

Why this instead of just using gnu tar, or any of the other
Archive:: packages?  In a word, IO.  Actually that's two
words if you unpack the acronym.

Unpacking a tar file in order to remove some parts and then
re-pack it causes a lot of IO.  Particularly for the unlink
afterwards.  Working in tmpfs is OK, until your files get
big.

We needed to repack incremental backups of up to 100Gb of
emails, one file per email.  Starting with a .tar.gz, and
ending with a .tar.gz.  Hence something that could sit in
a pipe like this:

zcat old.tar.gz | ./decider | gzip > new.tar.gz
