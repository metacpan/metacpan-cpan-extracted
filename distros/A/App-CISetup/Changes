- Fixed a bug in the update mode which would cause it to die.

- Added 5.26.0 to the list of Perl versions that the Travis code knows about.


0.05     2017-06-22

- Removed the use List::Gather. This seems to be the most likely culprit for
  some very odd test failures seen with threaded versions of Perl. See
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121777 for details.


0.04     2017-06-16

- Make sure IPC::System::Simple is included in prereqs. Reported by Slaven
  Rezić. RT #122115.


0.03     2017-06-16

- Flags passed on the CLI are now stored in a comment rather than in a YAML
  key. Travis is fine with unknown keys but AppVeyor chokes on them.

- The stored flags are now actually used when running the script on the same
  file again. CLI flags win over stored params.

- The generated AppVeyor install steps could break if your repo name contained
  a dot (.).


0.02     2017-05-26

0.01     2017-05-26
