NAME
    IPC::RunSession::Simple - Run a simple IPC session in the same vein as
    IPC::Run & Expect

VERSION
    Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        use IPC::RunSession::Simple

        $session = IPC::RunSession::Simple->open( "fcsh" )

        # Read until the prompt (which doesn't end in a newline)
        # Timeout after 5 seconds
        $result = $session->read_until( qr/\(fcsh\) /, 5 )

        if ( $result->closed ) {
             # We encountered an (abnormal) EOF... 
        }
        elsif ( $result->expired ) {
            # The timeout got triggered...
        }
        else {
            print $result->content
        }

        # Tell 'fcsh' we want to quit
        $session->write( "quit\n" )

DESCRIPTION
    A simple IPC session with read/write capability using IPC::Open3 and
    IO::Select

USAGE
  $session = IPC::RunSession::Simple->open( $cmd )
    Create a new session by calling "open3" on $cmd

  $result = $session->read( [ $timeout ] )
    Read (blocking) until some output is gotten

    If $timeout is given, then wait until output is gotten OR the timeout
    expires (setting $result->expired appropiately)

  $result = $session->read_until( $marker, [ $timeout ] )
    Read (blocking) until some output matching $marker is gotten

    $marker can either be a regular expression or a code block. If a code
    block is given, the content accumulated will be available as the first
    argument and as $_

    If $timeout is given, then wait until output is gotten OR the timeout
    expires (setting $result->expired appropiately). Any content collected
    up to the timeout will be included in $result->content

  $session->write( $content )
    Write $content to the input of the opened process

  $reader = $session->reader
    Return the reader filehandle (the STDOUT/STDERR of the process)

  $writer = $session->writer
    Return the writer filehandle (the STDIN of the process)

  $result->content
    The content read via "read" or "read_until"

  $result->expired
    True if a read returned as a result of taking longer than the specified
    timeout value

  $result->closed
    True if the process closed during the read
