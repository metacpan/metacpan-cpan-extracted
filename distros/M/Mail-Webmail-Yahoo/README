If you've ever seen the above, this package might be for you. Frustrated by
the lack of bulk processing tools in Yahoo mail, I was prompted to write this
package. It allows you to download to your local machine all of the messages
in your Yahoo account, attachments included. Future versions will allow bulk
deletion, forwarding, and other useful mail functions.

This is version 0.6 of the Mail::Webmail::Yahoo package; it may be slightly
brittle. While I have been testing it and using it on my own yahoo
accounts for several weeks, I would appreciate any feedback, positive or
negative.

Older versions of this package used 'snagmail.pl' and 'sendhoo.pl' to perform
message retrieval and send duties. These have now been rolled into a much
enhanced 'yahootils.pl' application. They remain in the distribution but will
be removed at some future date.

yahootils.pl comes with full instructions included. To see all available
options, call

  yahootils.pl --help

CAVEATS

There may be some issues with messages converted from HTML to plaintext. This
is due to the way HTML::Element renders as_text(), although I expect to tidy
it up in future. Generally if the message has the correct content type, things
should for the most part work as expected.
