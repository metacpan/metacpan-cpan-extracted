NAME

    Alien::help2man - Build or find help2man

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    In your script or module:

     use Alien::help2man;
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @PATH, Alien::help2man->bin_dir;

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides help2man so that it can be used by other
    Perl distributions that are on CPAN. It does this by first trying to
    detect an existing install of help2man on your system. If found it will
    use that. If it cannot be found, the source code will be downloaded
    from the internet and it will be installed in a private share location
    for the use of other modules.
