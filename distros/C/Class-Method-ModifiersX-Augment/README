    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Augment - adds "augment method => sub {...}"
    support to Class::Method::Modifiers

SYNOPSIS
       use v5.14;
       use strict;
       use Test::More;
   
       package Document {
          use Class::Method::ModifiersX::Augment;
          sub new       { my ($class, %self) = @_; bless \%self, $class }
          sub recipient { $_[0]{recipient} }
          sub as_xml    { sprintf "<document>%s</document>", inner }
       }
   
       package Greeting {
          BEGIN { our @ISA = 'Document' };
          use Class::Method::ModifiersX::Augment;
          augment as_xml => sub {
             sprintf "<greet>%s</greet>", inner
          }
       }
   
       package Greeting::English {
          BEGIN { our @ISA = 'Greeting' };
          use Class::Method::ModifiersX::Augment;
          augment as_xml => sub {
             my $self = shift;
             sprintf "Hello %s", $self->recipient;
          }
       }
   
       my $obj = Greeting::English->new(recipient => "World");
       is(
          $obj->as_xml,
          "<document><greet>Hello World</greet></document>",
       );
   
       done_testing();

    (Note that the synopsis shows Perl v5.14+ syntax for package declaration,
    but this module and its accompanying Moo wrapper support Perl v5.8 and
    above.)

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Augment extends Class::Method::Modifiers with
    the `augment` method modifier, allowing you to use this Moose abomination
    for augmenting superclass methods in non-Moose classes.

    See Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers for details of how `augment` and its
    companion function `inner` work.

    This module exports two functions:

    `augment NAME, CODE`
    `inner`

    If you want to use these with Moo classes, please look at MooX::Augment
    instead.

CAVEATS
    This implementation of `augment` piggybacks onto Class::Method::Modifiers'
    implementation of `around`. As a result, when multiple method modifiers
    are applied to the same method, the order in which they are applied might
    not match Moose.

    This has not been thoroughly tested in conjunction with
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Override. Using them in the same class should
    be safe. Using them to modify the same method will probably break your
    code. The only guarantee we give you is that you get to keep both halves.

    `augment` modifiers do not work in Moo::Role or Role::Tiny roles. (Though
    `inner` might.)

    `augment`/`inner` is a crazy idea to begin with, and virtually nobody
    understands it.

BUGS
    If you find any bugs in this module they are almost certainly caused by
    one of the following reasons:

    *   You don't understand `augment`/`inner` properly, so you have incorrect
        expectations about how this module should behave.

    *   I don't understand `augment`/`inner` properly, so I have incorrect
        expectations about how this module should behave.

    *   Nobody understands `augment`/`inner` properly, and the whole idea is
        broken.

    Please report any bugs to

DEPENDENCIES
    Class::Method::ModifiersX::Augment requires Perl 5.008, and the
    Class::Method::Modifiers package (which is available from CPAN).

    MRO::Compat is also required for Perl versions earlier than 5.010.

    The accompanying module MooX::Augment requires Moo. However, the
    installation scripts for this distribution do not check that this is
    installed. If you use MooX::Augment, it is assumed that you have installed
    its dependencies separately.
