	* version 0.49: fix infun, broken since 0.46 refactor

	Michal Krupicka ( Michal dot Krupicka at skoda-auto dot cz ) reported
	that I broke the the input function (it worked differently from 0.45
	and the documentation) when I converted to using IPC::Run3.  This restores
	compatability with 0.45. Thanks Michal.

Mon Sep 21 15:58:35 CDT 2015 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.48: fix list option parsing

	Bill Shunn ( proprietor at shunn dot net ) found a bug in list option
	parsing that broke filters (and probably others as well).

Fri Sep 11 08:36:39 CDT 2015 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.47: fixed hash ref parsing

	Andreas Koenig ( andk at cpan dot org ) pointed out a problem
	with the hash ref compatibility code, and then graciously provided
	a test case to help me track down the problem. Added another
	test to confirm.

Wed Jul 29 09:32:05 CDT 2015 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.46: added support for new options up to 3.1.1

	Max Maischein ( corion at corion dot net ) provided code and
	insight on how to support Windows OS, as well as some improved
	tests.  IPC::Open3 was replaced with IPC::Run3 as part of this
	effort, thanks to Max for showing me this module.  It simplified
	a big chunk of code and I was able to take advantage of its
	features in a few places (see infun and files-from below).

	Gavin Carr ( gavin at openfusion dot com dot au ) enlightened me
	some time ago of the advantages of ordered args with rsync.
	Order of args is now preserved.  This is a long overdue change.
	Rsync itself performs some things differently based on the order
	of some args, hopefully this is a big improvement in functionality
	and doesn't break anyone.  Passing options as a hash ref is now
	deprecated.  Thanks Gavin, sorry it took me so long to implement.

	Petya Kohts ( kohts at yandex-team dot ru ) suggested code
	for srchost that would properly handle the rsync:// prefix

	Neil Hooey ( nhooey at gmail dot com) provided a better
	algorithm for the status method.

	Erez Schatz ( moonbuzz at gmail dot com ) sent improved pod
	formatting that should work better with pod2html

	The module debug option has become moddebug so it does not conflict
	with the rsync debug option.

	infun can now be an array ref, contents are fed to stdin via IPC::Run3

	files-from can also be an array ref, this is handled in the module
	by setting infun to the array ref and --files-from='-'

	Added several more tests.

Fri Nov  7 08:45:42 CST 2014 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.45: removed 'use File::Rsync::Config', oops

Thu Nov  6 10:03:01 CST 2014 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.44: long overdue fix for automated builds, removed
	prompt for rsync path to use PATH environment instead.

Tue Aug 18 10:56:10 CDT 2009 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.43: Gavin Carr ( gavin at openfusion dot com dot au )
	sent a patch to make include-from and exclude-from allow multiple
	arguments.  This oversight was a misunderstanding on my part as to
	how these actually work.  Many thanks to Gavin for correcting my
	perception in the form of a very helpful patch.

	also added support for new options in 2.6.7

	removed 1 second sleep based on Petya Kohts testing ( kohts at
	yandex-team dot ru ) as this is un-needed paranoia

	added test to check for rsync binary in configured location

Fri Jun 24 21:11:04 CDT 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.42: added Scalar::Util as a required module since it was
	not part of core before perl 5.8 (sorry).  Also changed build-name for
	the config file so it will not clobber perl's Config.pm for odd
	@INC orders.  Thanks again to Simon Myers (Smylers at stripey dot com )
	for pointing out the potential problem.

Tue May 24 11:28:43 CDT 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.41: fixed 'use Scalar::Util' again (hopefully correct this
	time).  Trying to do too many things at once, and need work on tests
	to catch my bonehead mistakes.  Improved test.pl coming soon.

Mon May 23 16:51:42 CDT 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.40: I missed one critical line in the patch from Smylers
	and broke more than I fixed.  This update includes the 'use' statement.

Sun May 22 17:13:16 CDT 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.39: Simon Myers ( Smylers at stripey dot com ) sent
	a patch to allow Path::Class objects as source paths.  The previous
	error checking only allowed source to be a string or an array.
	This update bypasses the sanity-check if the source is a blessed
	object and now assumes the programmer knows what they are doing
	and that the object can be read as a string.

	Added support for the only-write-batch option in rsync-2.6.5-pre1

Wed Mar 30 22:06:04 CST 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.38: Harald Flaucher ( Harald dot Flaucher at
	mondial dot de ) requested support for the --acls option, which
	is not part of rsync, but an included patch that some use.  His
	request inspired the idea for the 'literal' option in the module
	to allow passing arbitrary literal arguments to rsync so other
	patches or even newer versions of rsync can be used.  Also added
	support for the protocol option that was previously undocumented.

Sat Mar  5 19:59:01 CST 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.37: added support for new options in 2.6.4-pre1:
	del, delete-before, delete-during, delay-updates, dirs, filter,
	fuzzy, itemize-changes, list-only, omit-dir-times, remove-sent-files,
	and max-size.  See the rsync manpage for full details on these options.

	Fixed a type-o that kept partial-dir from being handled properly.

	Bill Uhl ( buhl at web-services dot net ) provided a patch to
	split out the creation of the rsync command from the exec function.
	The new call (getcmd) returns a reference to an array of the command
	to be executed.  Bill is working on a graphical interface to rsync
	using this module and wants an alternate exec wrapper.  This version
	includes a variation on his patch.

Tue Jan 18 17:05:00 CST 2005 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.36: fix for "uninitialized value" warning submitted
	thru rt.cpan.org.  Thanks go to the anonymous Debian user (HTH).

Wed Dec  8 18:33:45 CST 2004 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.35: test 4 was failing due to bad pattern match in the
	test code. no functional changes (error message changed for 2.6.3).

Thu Aug 12 20:45:43 CDT 2004 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.34: added support for new options in 2.6.3: partial-dir,
	checksum-seed, keep-dirlinks, inplace, ipv4, and ipv6.

Tue Jun  1 12:59:36 CDT 2004 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.33: Fixed a type-o in parsing of quote-dst tag.
	Peter teStrake (peter dot testrake at tradingscreen dot com)
	pointed out that the exec method did not protect itself from a
	user-defined SIGCHLD handler and could miss the exit of rsync and
	report a false error.  A local reset of the handler should protect
	it and still leave the handler in place for the rest of the user
	code.

Sun Dec 21 03:18:26 CST 2003 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.32: Added support for new option in 2.6.0: --from0,
	--no-relative, --no-implied-dirs, and --files-from.  A new
	infun option has been added so a user-supplied function can print the
	list to --files-from=-.  See the rsync man page and the pod doc for
	more info.  Also fixed a bug underscores were not recognized as the
	hyphen equivalent for quote_dst, quote_src and path_to_rsync.
	An anonymous user submitted a fix where parens were needed due to
	precedence problems when srchost is defined.  The fix is included
	in this release.

Tue Jul 29 22:13:50 CDT 2003 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.31: Bill Uhl ( buhl at web-services dot net ) sent a
	patch to add the missing ignore-existing option and make write-batch
	a scalar option (both were oversights on my part).  He also
	suggested quoting the source paths.  Since this could break intended
	actions, There are now 2 options to do this if desired.  The
	quote-src and quote-dst flags will add double-quotes around each
	path in the source or the destination when set.  This should help
	avoid with pathnames containing spaces.  James CE Johnson sent a
	patch to add the no-stdin flag since calling the module under
	mod_perl was having problems.  Bill also reported problems on win32
	and I found strange behavior myself during some tests, so I have
	backed-out the passing of stdin (from 0.27) entirely.

Tue Jun 10 14:41:54 CDT 2003 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.30: Paul Egan sent a patch that does a much better
	job of cleaning up the select loop.  I was still not taking full
	advantage of the features of IO::Select or IO::Handle.  Thanks
	go to Paul for a much simplified loop, and hopefully an end to
	the hangs (at least those due to the perl code).

Mon Jun  9 17:39:42 CDT 2003 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.29: Paul Egan had another suggestion I liked very much.
	I switched to using IO::Select rather than calling select directly.
	I've always hated the ugly vec code that must be added in order to use
	select.  It clutters the program with lots of unrelated but essential
	cruft.  The module keeps all that separate from what is going on in the
	rsync wrapper.  Paul was still seeing a hang in certain cases, and
	Ronald J Kimball ( rjk at linguist dot thayer dot dartmouth dot edu )
	was having similar problems.  Both were seeing a hang on the eof tests,
	so I removed them (eof does not play well with sysread, but we need
	sysread to make sure we don't block).  I have not been able to make it
	hang (at least not yet).

Thu May 29 21:33:07 CDT 2003 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.28: Paul Egan ( paulegan at mail dot com ) found one of the
	cases where the module could block, and provided a patch to fix it.  The
	cost is a going thru select again after each block is read, but he was
	able to prove it stops the hang.  Paul also suggested an improvement on
	the sysread.  I am now using the block size of the file descriptor
	(defaulting back to 1024 if that fails for some reason).  Many thanks to
	Paul for not only finding a way to reproduce the hang, but also finding
	a fix.

Sat Feb  1 23:03:55 CST 2003 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.27: got into too big a rush and forgot to test.
	The STDIN hack caused IPC::Open3 to spew, so I had to change
	it to glob to work properly.  0.26 was never released, but
	now I'm thinking seriously about breaking the link between
	the module version and RCS.  I'll have to do this anyway
	if I move to Subversion for revision control, since it's versions
	are handled in a different manner.

Mon Jan 13 11:25:42 CST 2003 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.26: Added link-dest option (new in 2.5.6pre1).
	I previously closed stdin of the forked rsync command since rsync
	didn't really use it.  Now the include-from and exclude-from options
	may be set to '-' and rsync will read the list from stdin.  I've
	attempted to pass STDIN directly to rsync in case someone wants
	to use this option.  In my simple tests the code works, but I have
	not done extensive tests, and do not know if you can pass other data
	such as passwords (not a good idea in terms of security).  This
	may also have other side effects since STDIN could be a tty in some
	instances and not in others (may cause the underlying rsh, ssh, or
	other transport to behave differently during testing versus cron or
	other unattended execution).  If this becomes a problem for anyone
	I'll figure out some way to make it optional.

Tue Jan  7 13:46:56 CST 2003 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.25: Tong Zhu ( tongzhu at thereinc dot com ) found an error
	where use of errfun and/or outfun exposed possible use of uninitialized
	variables (those used to break output into individual lines).  Thanks
	for pointing out my error, and the useful 'diff' output making my coding
	error easy to track down and fix.

Wed Dec 11 17:57:25 CST 2002 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.24: Heiko Jansen ( heiko_jansen at web dot de ) found an
	error in the exec function where I was accessing the errfun and outfun
	functions from the main object, and ignoring them if they were passed to
	'exec'.  Thanks for pointing out the error, hopefully this will work
	much better for you know.

Wed Dec  4 22:38:14 CST 2002 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.23: I got 3 separate reports of hangs, but cannot reproduce
	the error (yet).  Added a trap and more eof tests to hopefully catch
	and exit properly.

Thu Mar 14 23:19:35 CST 2002 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.22: added options for rsync 2.5.4, no-blocking-io, no-detach,
	and no-whole-file.

Thu Dec 20 13:52:33 CST 2001 Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.21: added rsync+ options from 2.4.7pre4/2.5.0, read-batch
	and write-batch.

	Thanks to Jonathan Pelletier ( jonathan dot pelletier at matrox dot com
	) for catching (and supply a fix for) an output message loss.  This
	version contains a variation on his patch.  Jonathan also suggested the
	new method 'lastcmd' to return the last 'rsync' command passed to the
	system for debugging and error messages.

Fri Sep  7 15:18:58 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.20: made changes to test.pl so failed tests would
	return non-zero exit and actually fail the tests.  Also corrected
	several type-os in the POD documentation (thanks to Joe Smith
	( Joe dot Smith at wcom dot com ) for pointing them out).

Wed May 16 21:11:31 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.19: discovered the new makefile was installing
	into the wrong path.  It should follow the proper naming convention
	now.

Thu May 10 22:28:28 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.18: Many thanks to Andreas Koenig ( andreas dot koenig at
	dubravka dot kbx dot de ) for setting me straight on the architecture
	specific versus the arch-independent directory usage, and for explaining
	why this wasn't showing up in the by-module listings.  The tar file now
	has a recognizable .pm file in it for proper CPAN distribution.  There
	is also a File::Rsync::Config.pm in the arch-specific dir where the
	build process stores the path to the rsync executable.

Mon May  7 01:07:44 CDT 2001  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.17: I decided it is better for the out and err methods
	to return any collected output regardless of whether or not an output
	function has been defined.  This way you can process each line yourself
	and still print the entire output in bulk if desired.  This also
	keeps me from having to work out what these methods should return
	if called when an output function has been defined.

Thu Feb 15 21:25:23 CST 2001  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.16: James Mello ( kingjamm at colltech dot com ) submitted a
	patch to add a 'list' function, and educated me on the interesting
	aspect of calling rsync without a destination in order to obtain an 'ls
	-l' or 'ls -lr' (with -r or -a) style output.  Rather than duplicating
	the exec function I made modifications to it and built a wrapper to get
	the list functionality.  This has all kinds of possibilities.  Many
	thanks to James for the great idea and the education on an option I had
	never explored.

	use File::Rsync;$rs=File::Rsync->new(srchost => 'localhost:');
	print $rs->list; will list available modules on the local daemon.

Tue Nov 28 10:22:50 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.15: After more thought and discussion with Boris we decided
	a second arg of either 'out' or 'err' should be passed to the functions
	so a single user-defined function could be used and it will be able to
	determine the source of the text in arg 1.  Simple functions can ignore
	the second arg.  The examples below would need to change to 'outfun =>
	sub {print shift}' and 'errfun => sub {print shift}' to keep from
	printing the source string. (version 0.14 was not released to CPAN)

Fri Nov 17 23:03:00 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.14: Per suggestion from Boris Goldowsky ( boris at range dot
	infoplease dot com ), added 'outfun' and 'errfun' options.  If you
	supply a function (CODE) reference to these the stderr and stdout from
	rsync is passed to these functions one output line at a time and is not
	collected internally for post examination.  Providing a function like
	'outfun => sub {print @_}' will cause each line to be printed as they
	arrive.  A function like 'outfun => sub {print "."}' will simply shows
	progress dots like cpio's -V option.  Thanks to Boris for the
	suggestion.  Sorry it took me so long to get it added.

Sat Sep 16 23:32:59 CDT 2000  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.13: added suport for new flags blocking-io and ignore-errors,
	as well as scalars bwlimit, max-delete, and modify-window.  I also
	rearranged the options hashes into a vertical sort similar to 'ls'.
	This makes additions a bit more difficult, but makes reading and
	verifying the options much easier (at least for me).

Tue Feb 29 17:41:14 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.12: pervious version fixed blocking, but was not clean
	and caused the tests to fail in odd ways.  This should be better.

	* also added code to treat underscore the same as hyphen in option keys
	similar to Tk.  This allows the use of bareword keys in hashes without
	being mis-interpreted as subtraction.

Fri Feb 18 17:45:13 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.11: fixed a blocking problem in the exec function
	If one of the output pipes filled up it hung forever (oops).

Mon Feb  7 14:05:37 CST 2000  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.10: removed comments about rsync not considering some things
	to be errors.  This appears to be a bug in 2.3.2 on Linux.  It has been
	submitted to the rsync team.  On Solaris rsync properly returns a non-zero
	exit status if the source path does not exist.  The bug was fixed in the
	CVS tree, and in the release 2.4.1.

	* added support for --backup-dir and --existing options (new in 2.4.1)

	* Since I've not heard from anyone about keeping the command-line style
	options, I've dropped them.  The hash-style affords more flexibility
	anyway.  I also removed some duplicate code in parseopts since I can now
	treat all args as a hash.

	* After some discussion on the rsync mailing list I was told about a
	method of passing multiple source arguments for a remote server.  I've
	added a new hash key 'srchost' to be used in combination with the 'source'
	array to make it easier to use this capability.  If the source host is
	remote, and you have multiple source paths, you can put the source
	hostname in 'srchost', and the paths in the 'source' array.  The module
	will assemble them as a single argument to rsync.  If 'srchost' is null
	then the 'source' array is passed to exec as separate arguments.

Wed Dec  1 21:55:44 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.09: removed bareword keys in hashes (5.00404 doesn't like
	my use of 'scalar' as a key)

	* version 0.08: changed test 5 in test.pl to account for different
	return status between Solaris and Linux.  I'll need to look into why
	one detects the error and the other doesn't (rsync itself, not perl).

Tue Nov 30 20:46:00 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.07:

	* removed global $pkgname, now uses 'my $pkgname=ref $self' instead.
	I also had to bless $self earlier in 'new' so defopts, and parseopts can
	use 'ref $self' to determine the package name.  It was not too bright
	to hardcode the package name (vacations can have odd effects on the brain)

	* changed saveopts and parseopts to begin with underscore since they
	are for internal use only.

Sun Nov 28 19:41:31 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.06:

	* added $pkgname for 'carp' messages to make it clearer where they came
	from.

	* added missing check for 'include' in exec method

	* other misc cleanup and clarification of code and documentation

Sun Nov 28 02:47:34 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.05: major re-organization and re-writing of internal
	functions to add the ability to pass a hash reference for perl-style
	options handling.  (Thanks to Greg Ward for the suggestion)  This gives
	increased flexibility including the ability to turn off boolean flags,
	and to build your own include or exclude list as an array and pass a
	reference to the array to the module.  The same can be done for source
	paths.

	* removed leading double-dashes from the option keys.  It is easier to
	add them in the parser for command-line style than to remove them for
	perl-style hashes.

	* changed 'err' and 'out' methods to return an empty string or an empty
	list if no output was generated.  If there was output they return it as
	an array or a reference to an array as before.  This should make testing
	for the existence of output more efficient.  Before you had to call them
	in a scalar context and dereference the return in order to check.  Now
	you can use a simple truth test.  Also added a note about conditions
	where rsync itself can return a true (0) exit but the programmer may
	consider it an error.  In these situations you need to check stderr for
	error messages (such as 'no such file or directory').  See 'exec' method
	in the manpage.

	* removed newlines from carp messages so the 'at <prog> line ##' is on
	the same line as the rest of the error message (bad habit from die).

	* changed all return values except 'new' to zero instead of undef so
	-w won't complain about use of un-initialized values.  If anyone has
	a good reason to put this back (like good/standard coding practices) let
	me know.

	* added test.pl script for 'make test'.

Sun Nov 21 02:18:56 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.04: added missing 'next' that would cause a parsing
	error if -P was used.

	* Renamed module to File::Rsync (Thanks to Tim Bunce for the suggestion)
	It really fits better here than in Net::, but once I thought of it
	as a network-based program I had a mental block when considering other
	groups.

Fri Nov 19 13:25:18 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.03: --address should be a scalar, not a flag (the
	rsync man page is unclear on this).

Wed Nov 17 21:20:16 CST 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.02:

	* wrote first draft of Makefile.PL and makepm.PL to wrap it all up
	as a real perl module.

	* added new options for rsync 2.3.2 (-P, --delete-after, and
	--address)
	-P is short for --partial and --progress. --address is only
	used in server mode.  I don't know what good these are inside
	this module, but you should still be able to pass them if you
	want.
	--delete-after allows the user to delay any --delete actions
	until after all other files are synced.  The default is to
	perform any deletes before in order help insure sufficient disk
	space is available.  See the rsync (1) man page for more
	details.

	* remove any chance of clobbering $_ (mostly paranoia I hope)

Tue Jun 15 15:27:20 CDT 1999  Lee Eakin  ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )

	* version 0.01: (initial) based on rsync 2.3.1
