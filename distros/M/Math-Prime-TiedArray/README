Math-Prime-TiedArray

This is an implementation of a tied array of prime numbers.  The array can be
treated as if it's infinite, as new primes will be calculated as they are
needed.

           use Math::Prime::TiedArray;

           my @primes;
           tie @primes, "Math::Prime::TiedArray";

           # print the first 100 primes:
           print join ", ", @primes[0..99];

           # print the 200th prime:
           print $primes[199];

           # print all the primes smaller than 500
           while ((my $prime = shift @primes) < 500) {
             print "$prime, ";
           }
