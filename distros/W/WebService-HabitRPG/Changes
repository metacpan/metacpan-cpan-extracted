Revision history for WebService::HabitRPG

0.29      2017-05-26 22:24:33-05:00 America/Chicago
    * Abandon JSON::Any in favor of JSON::MaybeXS.

0.28      2016-07-07 08:19:39-05:00 America/Chicago

0.27      2016-06-25 09:28:55-05:00 America/Chicago (TRIAL RELEASE)
    * Bumped up to v3 API.  The v3 API should work exactly
      the same as before, except when querying tasks by
      type, a plural form of the type (ie. dailys, not
      daily) must now be used.  Singular forms will be
      supported through the module over the next release
      or so, but a warning will occur.

0.26      2016-04-04 19:39:31-05:00 America/Chicago

0.23      2015-10-28 07:38:27-05:00 America/Chicago

    * BUGFIX: Task::active_today returns true when used on
              called on a task that repeats over an
              interval (GH #35).

    * FEATURE: A task's streak is now available via an
               accessor (GH #36).

0.22      2014-05-20 12:21:42+10:00 Australia/Melbourne

    * BUGFIX:   _get_tasks() with a single task ID no longer
                produces a 'Not an ARRAY reference' error.

    * BUGFIX:   Fewer experimental warnings about given/when on
                more recent perls (Courtesy Rob Hoelz in GH #34)

    * TESTS:    Disabled a bit-rotted live test in t/99_online.t

0.21      2013-09-13 19:47:58 Australia/Melbourne

    * FEATURE:  _get_tasks() now sorts by task type (todo/daily/etc).
                This emulates the behaviour provided by the older
                HabitRPG server codebase.

0.20      2013-08-14 13:37:36 PST8PDT

    * DEBUG:    Settng HRPG_DEBUG=1 in the environment now shows
                arguments used to construct a task, *before* that
                task is actually constructed.

0.19      2013-05-08 15:31:02 Australia/Melbourne

    * FEATURE:  `hrpg tasks` and `hrpg [daily|todo|habit]` now support
                an optional search parameter.

    * FEATURE:  Experimental tag support. Add a [tags] section to your
                ~/.habitrpgrc file with tag => uuid pairs. All searches
                starting with a '^' will match all tasks with that
                tag.  (Eg: `hrpg daily ^home`)

    * FEATURE:  Experimental tag prefix support. Add a [config]
                section to your ~/.habitrpg file and a
                `tag_prefix = whatever` section if you don't like the
                default tag character of '^'.

0.18      2013-04-29 14:52:14 Australia/Melbourne

                ones.

    * BUGFIX:   The value parameter when creating new tasks
                is no longer ignored. GH #31, thanks @toddgrotenhuis

                WS::HRPG->new will allow the LWP::UserAgent
                keep-alive behaviour to be specified.

    * CONFIG:   You can now set keep_alive = 0 in the
                [connection] section of ~/.habitrpgrc to

    * DEBUG:    Set environment HRPG_DEBUG=1 for debugging.

    * BUGFIX:   Detect and skip undef/null values returned by
                the /task endpoint.  GH #27

0.14      2013-04-06 16:58:45 Australia/Melbourne

    * OPTIMISE: Connections to the habitrpg server are now kept-alive
                for faster network ops.

0.13      2013-04-05 17:38:56 Australia/Melbourne

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg show' to give detailed stats about a task.

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg clear daily' to force unchecking of all daily
               tasks. This is useful if the web server fails to
               uncheck them, or if you never use the web version. (GH #16)

    * FEATURE: Added --beta switch to 'hrpg', which uses the beta API
               server.

    * FEATURE: Added --dev switch to 'hrpg', to use localhost:3000 .

    * FEATURE: WS::HRPG::new_task() supports the 'extend' parameter for
               setting extended attributes.

    * FEATURE: hrpg supports setting extended parameters on task creation.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: _update in WS::HRPG and hrpg. This uses the
               PUT API, and allows for setting arbitrary attributes via
               the API.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: [auth-beta] and [auth-dev] sections may be
               added to the ~/.habitrpgrc file, and their details will
               be used when using the --beta or --dev switches.
