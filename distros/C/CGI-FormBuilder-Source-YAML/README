NAME
       CGI::FormBuilder::Source::YAML - Initialize FormBuilder from YAML file

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::FormBuilder;

        my $form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
           source  => {
               source  => 'form.fb',
               type    => 'YAML',
           },
        );

        my $lname = $form->field('lname');  # like normal

DESCRIPTION
       This reads a YAML (YAML::Syck) file that contains FormBuilder config
       options and returns a hash to be fed to CGI::FormBuilder->new().

       Instead of the syntax read by CGI::FormBuilder::Source::File, it uses
       YAML syntax as read by YAML::Syck.  That means you fully specify the
       entire data structure.

       LoadCode is enabled, so you can use YAML syntax for defining subrou-
       tines.  This is convenient if you have a function that generates vali-
       dation subrefs, for example, I have one that can check profanity using
       Regexp::Common.

        validate:
           myfield:
               javascript: /^[\s\S]{2,50}$/
               perl: !!perl/code: >-
                   {   My::Funk::fb_perl_validate({
                           min         => 2,
                           max         => 50,
                           profanity   => 'check'
                       })->(shift);
                   }

POST PROCESSING
       There are two exceptions to "pure YAML syntax" where this module does
       some post-processing of the result.

       REFERENCES (ala CGI::FormBuilder::Source::File)

       You can specify references as string values that start with \&, \$, \@,
       or \% in the same way you can with CGI::FormBuilder::Source::File.  If
       you have a full direct package reference, it will look there, otherwise
       it will traverse up the caller stack and take the first it finds.

       For example, say your code serves multiple sites, and a menu gets dif-
       ferent options depending on the server name requested:

        # in My::Funk:
        our $food_options = {
            www.meats.com   => [qw( beef    chicken horta   fish    )],
            www.veggies.com => [qw( carrot  apple   quorn   radish  )],
        };

        # in source file:
        options: \@{ $My::Funk::food_options->{ $ENV{SERVER_NAME} } }

       EVAL STRINGS

       You can specify an eval statement.  You could achieve the same example
       a different way:

        options: eval { $My::Funk::food_options->{ $ENV{SERVER_NAME} }; }

       The cost either way is about the same -- the string is eval'd.

EXAMPLE
        method:     GET
        header:     0
        title:      test
        name:       test
        action:     /test
        submit:     test it
        linebreaks: 1

        required:
           - test1
           - test2

        fields:
           - test1
           - test2
           - test3
           - test4

        fieldopts:
           test1:
               type:       text
               size:       10
               maxlength:  32

           test2:
               type:       text
               size:       10
               maxlength:  32

           test3:
               type:       radio
               options:
                   -
                       - 1
                       - Yes
                   -
                       - 0
                       - No

           test4:
               options:    \@test4opts
               sort:       \&Someother::Package::sortopts

        validate:
           test1:      /^\w{3,10}$/
           test2:
               javascript: EMAIL
               perl:       eq 'test@test.foo'
           test3:
               - 0
               - 1
           test4:  \@test4opts

       You get the idea.  A bit more whitespace, but it works in a standard-
       ized way.

METHODS
       new()

       Normally not used directly; it is called from CGI::FormBuilder.  Cre-
       ates the "CGI::FormBuilder::Source::YAML" object.  Arguments from the
       'source' hash passed to CGI::FormBuilder->new() will become defaults,
       unless specified in the file.

       parse($source)

       Normally not used directly; it is called from CGI::FormBuilder.  Parses
       the specified source file.  No fancy params -- just a single filename
       is accepted.  If the file isn't acceptable to YAML::Syck, I suppose it
       will die.
