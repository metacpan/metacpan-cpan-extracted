NAME
    CGI::IDS - PerlIDS - Perl Website Intrusion Detection System (XSS, CSRF,
    SQLI, LFI etc.)

VERSION
    Version 1.0217 - based on and tested against the filter tests of PHPIDS
    https://phpids.org rev. 1409

DESCRIPTION
    PerlIDS (CGI::IDS) is a website intrusion detection system based on
    PHPIDS https://phpids.org/ to detect possible attacks in website
    requests, e.g. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery
    (CSRF), SQL Injections (SQLI) etc.

    It parses any hashref for possible attacks, so it does not depend on
    CGI.pm.

    The intrusion detection is based on a set of converters that convert the
    request according to common techniques that are used to hide attacks.
    These converted strings are checked for attacks by running a filter set
    of currently 68 regular expressions and a generic attack detector to
    find obfuscated attacks. For easily keeping the filter set up-to-date,
    PerlIDS is compatible to the original XML filter set of PHPIDS, which is
    frequently updated.

    Each matching regular expression has it's own impact value that
    increases the tested string's total attack impact. Using these total
    impacts, a threshold can be defined by the calling application to log
    the suspicious requests to database and send out warnings via e-mail or
    even SMS on high impacts that indicate critical attack activity. These
    impacts can be summed per IP address, session or user to identify
    attackers who are testing the website with small impact attacks over a
    time.

    You can improve the speed and the accurancy (reduce false positives) of
    the IDS by specifying an XML whitelist file. This whitelist check can
    also be processed separately by using CGI::IDS::Whitelist if you want to
    pre-check the parameters on your application servers before you send
    only the suspicious requests over to worker servers that do the complete
    CGI::IDS check.

SYNOPSIS
     use CGI;
     use CGI::IDS;

     $cgi = new CGI;

     # instantiate the IDS object;
     # do not scan keys, values only; don't scan PHP code injection filters (IDs 58,59,60);
     # whitelist the parameters as per given XML whitelist file;
     # All arguments are optional, 'my $ids = new CGI::IDS();' is also working correctly,
     # loading the entire shipped filter set and not scanning the keys.
     # See new() for all possible arguments.
     my $ids = new CGI::IDS(
         whitelist_file  => '/home/hinnerk/ids/param_whitelist.xml',
         disable_filters => [58,59,60],
     );

     # start detection
     my %params = $cgi->Vars;
     my $impact = $ids->detect_attacks( request => \%params );

     if ($impact > 0) {
         my_log( $ids->get_attacks() );
     }
     if ($impact > 30) {
         my_warn_user();
         my_email( $ids->get_attacks() );
     }
     if ($impact > 50) {
         my_deactivate_user();
         my_sms( $ids->get_attacks() );
     }

     # now with scanning the hash keys
     $ids->set_scan_keys(scan_keys => 1);
     $impact = $ids->detect_attacks( request => \%params );

    See examples/demo.pl in CGI::IDS module package for a running demo.

    You might want to build your own 'session impact counter' that increases
    during multiple suspicious requests by one single user, session or IP
    address.

METHODS
  new()
    Constructor. Can optionally take a hash of settings. If *filters_file*
    is not given, the shipped filter set will be loaded, *scan_keys*
    defaults to 0.

    The filter set and whitelist will stay loaded during the lifetime of the
    object. You may call `detect_attacks()' multiple times, the attack array
    (`get_attacks()') will be emptied at the start of each run of
    `detect_attacks()'.

    For example, the following is a valid constructor:

     my $ids = new CGI::IDS(
         filters_file    => '/home/hinnerk/ids/default_filter.xml',
         whitelist_file  => '/home/hinnerk/ids/param_whitelist.xml',
         scan_keys       => 0,
         disable_filters => [58,59,60],
     );

    The Constructor dies (croaks) if no filter rule could be loaded.

XML INPUT FILES
  Filters
    This module is compatible with the PHPIDS filter set. Please find the
    latest (frequently updated) filter file from the PHPIDS Subversion
    repository at
    https://dev.itratos.de/projects/php-ids/repository/raw/trunk/lib/IDS/def
    ault_filter.xml.

    Example XML Code
     <filters>
         <filter>
             <id>1</id>
             <rule><![CDATA[(?:"+.*>)|(?:[^\w\s]\s*\/>)|(?:>")]]></rule>

                 <tag>csrf</tag>
             </tags>
             <impact>4</impact>
         </filter>
         <filter>
             <id>2</id>
             <rule><![CDATA[(?:"+.*[<=]\s*"[^"]+")|(?:"\w+\s*=)|(?:>\w=\/)|(?:#.+\)["\s]*>)|(?:"\s*(?:src|style|on\w+)\s*=\s*")]]></rule>

             </tags>
             <impact>4</impact>
         </filter>
     </filters>

    Used XML Tags
    * filters
        The root tag.

        * filter
            Filter item.

            * id
                Filter ID for referring in log files etc.

            * rule
                The regular expression for detection of malicious code.
                Case-insensitive; mode modifiers *i*, *m* and *s* in use.

            * description
                Description of what the filter finds.

            * tags
                Set of tags that describe the kind of attack.

                * tag
                    Currently used values are *xss*, *csrf*, *sqli*, *dt*,
                    *id*, *lfi*, *rfe*, *spam*, *dos*.

            * impact
                Value of impact, defines the weight of the attack. Each
                detection run adds the particular filter impacts to one
                total impact sum.

  Whitelist
    Using a whitelist you can improve the speed and the accurancy (reduce
    false positives) of the IDS. A whitelist defines which parameters do not
    need to undergo the expensive scanning (if their values match given
    rules and given conditions).

    Example XML Code
     <whitelist>
         <param>
             <key>scr_id</key>
             <rule><![CDATA[(?:^[0-9]+\.[0-9a-f]+$)]]></rule>
         </param>
         <param>
             <key>uid</key>
         </param>
         <param>
             <key>json_value</key>
             <encoding>json</encoding>
         </param>
         <param>
             <key>login_password</key>
             <conditions>
                 <condition>
                     <key>username</key>
                     <rule><![CDATA[(?:^[a-z]+$)]]></rule>
                </condition>
                <condition>
                    <key>send</key>
                </condition>
                <condition>
                    <key>action</key>
                    <rule><![CDATA[(?:^login$)]]></rule>
                </condition>
             </conditions>
         </param>
         <param>
             <key>sender_id</key>
             <rule><![CDATA[(?:[0-9]+\.[0-9a-f]+)]]></rule>
             <conditions>
                 <condition>
                     <key>action</key>
                     <rule><![CDATA[(?:^message$)]]></rule>
                </condition>
             </conditions>
         </param>
     </whitelist>

    Used XML Tags
    * whitelist
        The root tag.

        * param
            Parameter item. Defines the query parameter to be whitelisted.

            * key
                Parameter key.

            * rule
                Regular expression to match. If the parameter value matches
                this rule or the rule tag is not present, the IDS will not
                run its filters on it. Case-sensitive; mode modifiers *m*
                and *s* in use.

            * encoding
                Use value *json* if the parameter contains JSON encoded
                data. IDS will test the decoded data, otherwise a false
                positive would occur due to the 'suspicious' JSON encoding
                characters.

            * conditions
                Set of conditions to be fulfilled. This is the parameter
                environment in which the whitelisted parameter has to live
                in. The parameter will only be skipped if all conditions
                (and its own parameter rule) match.

                In the example XML this means: *login_password* may only be
                skipped of filtering if parameter *action* equals *login*,
                parameter *send* is present and parameter *username*
                contains only small letters.

                * condition
                    A condition to be fulfilled.

                    * key
                        Parameter key.

                    * rule
                        Regular expression to match. Missing `<rule>' means
                        *key has to be present no matter what content (can
                        even be empty)*.

    Helper methods for building and improving whitelists
     # check request
     my $impact = $ids->detect_attacks( request => $request);

     # print reasons and key/value pairs to a logfile for analysis of your application parameters.
     print LOG "filtered_keys:\n"
     foreach my $entry (@{$ids->{filtered_keys}}) {
         print LOG "\t".$entry->{reason}."\t".$entry->{key}.' => '.$entry->{value}."\n";
     }
     print LOG "non_filtered_keys:\n"
     foreach my $entry (@{$ids->{non_filtered_keys}}) {
         print LOG "\t".$entry->{reason}."\t".$entry->{key}.' => '.$entry->{value}."\n";
     }

    `$entry->{reason}' returns following reasons for skipping and
    non-skipping a value:

    `$ids->{filtered_keys}'
        * *key*: key not whitelisted
            Filtered due to missing rule set for this key.

        * *cond*: condition mismatch
            Filtered due to mismatching conditions for this key.

        * *rule*: rule mismatch
            Filtered due to mismatching rule for this key.

        * *enc*: value contains encoding
            Filtered due to containing (JSON) encoding for this key.

    `$ids->{non_filtered_keys}'
        * *empty*: empty value
            Not filtered due to empty value for this key.

        * *harml*: harmless value
            Not filtered due to harmless value string for this key.

        * *key*: key generally whitelisted
            Not filtered because the key has been generally whitelisted.

        * *r&c*: rule & conditions matched
            Not filtered due to matching rules and conditions for this key.
