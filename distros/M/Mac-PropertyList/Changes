# Changes for Mac::PropertyList

1.41 - Fri Sep 12 06:15:56 2014
	* Fix up some metadata (GitHub #4)

1.40 - Fri Jan  3 13:57:08 2014
	* Get rid of MYMETA

1.39 - Fri Sep 27 16:28:21 2013
	* Bump to full release

1.38_02 - Mon Sep 23 19:52:20 2013
	* Fix non-portable strftime format (RT #83460)

1.38_01 - Sun Feb 10 17:08:57 2013
	* Wim Lewis improved the binary reader / writer and made better
	tests for it.

1.38 - Tue Oct 23 15:44:26 2012
	* Wim Lewis <wiml@cpan.org> added WriteBinary. Great work!

1.37 - Thu Aug 30 11:39:39 2012
	* fix plist_as_perl to be the same as as_perl (and as
	documented)

1.36 - Sat Jun 16 16:10:01 2012
	* Update the docs, and make the previous dev releases official

1.35 - Fri Mar  9 19:38:59 2012
	* Document the as_perl method, which undecorates that internal
	data structure

1.34 - Mon Jul 11 18:10:36 2011
	* In ReadBinary, handle the data as big-endian. This means you
	need the > pack modifier introduced in 5.10.

1.33_02 - Sat Jul  9 13:17:15 2011
	* Require 5.10 because I need the > pack modifier

1.33_01 - Sat Jul  2 18:06:19 2011
	* Ensure binary reads are for big endian
	* Various cleanups for format and whitespace

1.33 - Tue Nov 24 08:00:33 2009
	* Hey, you have to decode those XML entities as you read
	them.

1.32 - Wed Sep 16 23:03:57 CDT 2009
	* Things seen to work, so lets release it.

1.31_01 - Sun May  3 06:40:14 2009
	* Added initial support for reading binary property lists

1.31 - Wed Jan 16 05:28:00 2008
	* Clean up for move from CVS to SVN. No need to upgrade.

1.30 - Tue Jan  9 22:32:27 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.29 - Wed May 17 19:25:09 2006
	* Added a parse_plist_fh function so you can open the files 
	any way that you like (for instance, as ":utf8").
	* Added pod_coverage.t to MANIFEST. I use it so I might as
	well distribute it.

1.28 - Tue May 16 01:15:52 2006
	* This change actually makes the change I claimed in the last version.
	* I added parse_plist_file to @EXPORT_OK, where it should have been.

1.26 - Tue May 16 01:02:29 2006
	* Added parse_plist_file to the export list. Why was it missing?
	* There are no other code changes, and you should upgrade
	if your users expect the documentation to be right. :)

1.24 - Tue Jan 17 21:19:40 2006
	* Ricardo Signes added as_basic_data() methods to turn the plist
	stuff into a Perl data structure without all the plist
	tracking. That's probably what most people want if they
	simply want to get data.

1.23 - Sun Jun  5 19:34:38 2005
	* Mike Ciul added some code to handle input differently for different
	sources (file, string, etc). It's a lot faster for very large files.
	* Most everything else is the same, so unless you need to work with
	very large files, you don't need to rush to upgrade.

1.21 - Fri Mar 11 22:49:28 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests
	* Bumped version past the 1.0 barrier
	* No code changes: no need to upgrade

0.95 - Fri Mar 11 22:45:21 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests, fixed issues
	* no code changes: no need to upgrade

0.95 - Thu Dec  2 03:23:26 2004
	* added Exporter support so you can import the functions, just
	like the examples showed.  Nothing is imported without you asking
	for it.

0.9 - Thu Sep  2 20:15:28 2004
	* fixed from with Time::HiRes tests
	* cleaned up distribution
	* No need to upgrade if you have the previous version (0.11)

0.51 - Tue Feb  3 16:39:39 2004
    * Refactored the module to get rid of goofy data structure—if you
    peeked behind-the-scenes this will bite you
    * Each type in the plist now has its own class, with methods to affect it

0.11 - Sat Jan 31 11:24:53 CST 2004
	* No code changes.
	* Removed requirements on Test::Manifest and Test::Pod
	* Fixed warnings that show up under -w

0.10 - Mon Feb  3 19:53:24 2003
	* No code changes
	* added missing modules to PREREQ_PM
	* tweaked false_key test
	* no need to upgrade from 0.09 if you already have it installed

0.09 - Fri Jan 31 11:20:53 2003
	* fixed bug in which a dict key named "0" would kill the program
