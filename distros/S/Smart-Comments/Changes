1.06 2015-10-24 NEILB
    - Added min perl version to code, so it will now appear in metadata
    - Added L<> links around the dependencies listed in the doc. RT#16456
    - Fixed some failing tests reported from CPAN Testers

1.05_01 2015-10-22 NEILB
    - The test t/while_num.t was using subtests in a way that requires
      *I think* at least verson 0.99 of Test::More.
      This caused some CPAN Testers failures.
      Set min version on Test::More in just that test.
    - The github repo changed to reflect my changed github username
