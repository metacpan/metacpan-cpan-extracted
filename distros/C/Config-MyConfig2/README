MyConfig2 is a flexible configuration file parser, that reads and writes
Apache-Style configuration files, with global key/value pairs and 
directives <directive my_directive></directive>

It supports
  * Configureable layout of configuration files, i.e. which keywords,
    which directives (if any), syntax checks for values

  * Flexible configurations, i.e. using tabs, spaces or = as delimiters
    between keywords and values

  * Apache Webserver style configuration directives

  * Keywords with multiple values

  * Methods to gather loaded configuration values in Perl context, i.e.
    as hashtree, lists or single values

  * Ability to modify the configuration, after it has been loaded

  * Ability to store a modified configuration file back to disk

  * Full Perl OO access
