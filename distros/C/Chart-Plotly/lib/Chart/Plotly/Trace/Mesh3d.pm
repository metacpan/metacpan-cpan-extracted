But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=head2 type

Trace type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item * alphahull

Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived from the set of vertices (points) represented by the `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If *-1*, Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at more than one point it will result triangles that are very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If *>0*, the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the parameter for the mesh fitting. If *0*,  the convex-hull algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z` point set into a convex hull.

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

=item * cauto

Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here `intensity`) or the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.

=item * cmax

Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmin` must be set as well.

=item * cmid

Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as `intensity`. Has no effect when `cauto` is `false`.

=item * cmin

Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmax` must be set as well.

=item * color

Sets the color of the whole mesh

=item * coloraxis

Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are *coloraxis*, *coloraxis2*, *coloraxis3*, etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`, `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis.

=item * colorbar

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

=item * contour

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=item * delaunayaxis

Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay triangulation. It has an effect if `i`, `j`, `k` are not provided and `alphahull` is set to indicate Delaunay triangulation.

=item * facecolor

Sets the color of each face Overrides *color* and *vertexcolor*.

=item * facecolorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  facecolor .

=item * flatshading

Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-poly look via flat reflections.

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=item * hoverlabel

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * hovertemplatesrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate .

=item * hovertext

Same as `text`.

=item * hovertextsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .

=item * i

A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the *first* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m], j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where `i[m] = n` points to the triplet `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in `i` represents a point in space, which is the first vertex of a triangle.

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=item * intensity

Sets the vertex intensity values, used for plotting fields on meshes

=item * intensitysrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  intensity .

=item * isrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  i .

=item * j

A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the *second* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m], j[m], k[m]}`  together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where `j[m] = n` points to the triplet `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in `j` represents a point in space, which is the second vertex of a triangle.

=item * jsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  j .

=item * k

A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the *third* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m], j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where `k[m] = n` points to the triplet  `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in `k` represents a point in space, which is the third vertex of a triangle.

=item * ksrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  k .

=item * lighting

=item * lightposition

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * metasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high `opacity` values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change.

=item * reversescale

Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin` will correspond to the last color in the array and `cmax` will correspond to the first color.

=item * scene

Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If *scene* (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If *scene2*, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene2`, and so on.

=item * showscale

Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace.

=item * stream

=item * text

Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

=item * textsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * vertexcolor

Sets the color of each vertex Overrides *color*. While Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and 255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA format, the alpha color should be normalized to be between 0 and 1.

=item * vertexcolorsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  vertexcolor .

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * x

Sets the X coordinates of the vertices. The nth element of vectors `x`, `y` and `z` jointly represent the X, Y and Z coordinates of the nth vertex.

=item * xcalendar

Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.

=item * xsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

=item * y
