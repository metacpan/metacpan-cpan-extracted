1.25_01 2015-11-18T04:55:45Z
	* If the tests can't connect to the fragile IEEE service,
	don't freak out.

1.25 2015-09-08T08:25:40Z
	* Bump to user version
	* CPAN Testers is down, so I hope this works.

	* Migrate to Mojolicious for network stuff
	* Start an abstraction of the cache so others can override it
	* load_cache no longer falls back. If your source isn't there,
	it fails.

1.24_02 2015-08-08T07:51:40Z
	* Update for new IEEE URLs. Again.

1.24_01 - Sun Jan 11 07:03:57 2015

	* Remove bad line from MANIFEST

1.1901 - 2012-09-03

	big speedup.
	* Fix some odd parsing cases with PRIVATE records
	(RT 79369)

1.18 - 2007-10-27
	* distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

1.17 - 2007-01-09
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.16 - 2006-11-17
	* Fixed case-typo in docs s/Mac/MAC/. That's important to some
	operating systems. :)
	* No code updates.

1.15 - 2006-06-25
	* Fixed up missing dependency, error in fetch_oui.t that
	should have been a conditional test

1.13 - 2006-06-23
	* Improved caching that uses DBM::Deep if available
	* Added fetch_oui_from_cache, so you can avoid the network
	if you really don't want to use it
	* Added fetch_oui_from_ieee, if you only want to fetch it
	from the network (and not from cache)
	* fetch_oui now comprises those two functions, trying the
	cache first

1.11 - 2006-06-16
	* Load any oui.txt source that you like (another URL or local
	file://)

1.01 - 2006-05-25
	* The last release forgot to bump the version number. There's no
	need to upgrade since this only fixes a missing MANIFEST.

0.24 - 2006-05-25
	* MANIFEST was missing from diff. I've fixed that.

0.24 - 2006-05-20
	* Minor distro updates, kwalitee cleanups, and typo squashing.
	No need to upgrade.

0.23 - 2006-04-06
	* Added Changes to MANIFEST so you can see this file.
	* There's no need to upgrade.

0.22 - 2005-03-11
	* Added POD coverage tests and fixed problems it found

0.21 - 2004-09-07
	* added README to dist
	* no need to upgrade

0.1 - 2004-09-01
	* first pass: there is still a lot of work to do and a lot of
	tests to write

0.1 - 2004-08-31
	* first pass, a bit of a monster that grew out of a simple
	script.
