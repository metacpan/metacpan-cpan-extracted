NAME
    Data::Collector - Collect information from multiple sources

VERSION
    version 0.15

SYNOPSIS
    Data::Collector collects various information from multiple sources and
    makes it available in different formats, similar to Puppet's Facter.

        use Data::Collector;

        my $collector = Data::Collector->new(
            engine      => 'OpenSSH', # default
            engine_args => { password => read_password('Pass: ') },
            format      => 'JSON', # default
        );

        my %data = $collector->collect;
        ...

    Data::Collector uses *Info*s to determine what information is collected.
    It then uses *Serialize*rs to serialize that information.

    An important concept in Data::Collector is that it does not use any
    modules to fetch the information, only shell commands. This might seem
    like a pain at first but it allows it to be run on remote machines
    without any RPC server/client set up. It might be changed in the future,
    but (at least now) it seems unlikely.

    The main purpose of Data::Collector is to facilitate an information
    gatherning subsystem, much like Puppet's Facter, to be used in system
    monitoring and administration.

    However, Data::Collector is much more dynamic. It supports any number of
    engines and formats. Thus, it can be used for push or pull situations,
    can work with monitoring systems, integrate with testing suites and
    otherwise a pretty wide variety of situations.

ATTRIBUTES
  engine(Str)
    The engine that will be used to collect the information. This is the
    underlying layer that will gather the information. The default is
    OpenSSH, you can use any other one you want and even create your own.

    By implementing your own, you can have fetching done via database
    queries, online searching, local system commands or even telnet, if
    that's what you're using.

  engine_args(HashRef)
    Any arguments that the engine might need. These are passed to the
    engine's *new* method. Other than making sure it's a hash reference, the
    value is not checked and is left for the engine's discression.

    Data::Collector::Engine::OpenSSH requires a *host*, and allows a *user*
    and *passwd*.

  format(Str)
    This is the format in which you want the information. This will most
    likely refer to the serializer you want, but it doesn't have to be. For
    example, you could implement your own *Serializer* which will actually
    be a module to push all the changes you want in a database you have.

    The default is JSON.

  format_args(HashRef)
    Much like *engine_args*, you can supply any additional arguments that
    will reach the serializer's *new* method.

  info_args(HashRef)
    Much like *engine_args* and *info_args*, you can supply any additional
    arguments that should go to specific Info module's *new* method.

        info_args => {
            IFaces => {
                ignore_ip    => ['127.0.0.1'],
                ignore_iface => ['lo'],
            },
        },

  data(HashRef)
    While (and post) collecting, this attribute contains all the information
    [being] gathered. It is this data that is sent to the serializer in
    order to do whatever it wants with it.

  engine_object(Object)
    This attributes holds the engine object. This should probably be left
    for either testing or advanced usage. Please refrain from playing with
    it if you're unsure how it works.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  collect
    The main function of Data::Collector. It runs all the information
    collecting modules. When it is done, it runs the *serialize* method in
    order to serialize the information fetched.

  serialize
    Loads the serializer (according to the *format* selected) and asks it to
    serialize the data it collected.

    This method can be run manually as well, but it is automatically run
    when you run *collect*.

  clear_registry
    Clears the information registry. The registry keeps all the keys of
    different information modules. The registry makes sure information
    modules don't step on each other.

    This is merely a helper method. It simply runs:

        Data::Collector::Info->clear_registry;

    This is actually only a mere helper method.

  BUILD
    Internal initialize subroutine that sets the default OS to CentOS.

  load_info
    Loads all the infos available.

  load_os
    Currently not being used.
