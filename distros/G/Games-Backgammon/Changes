0.05  Tue Feb 11
        - removed assert commands from the c code part,
          as there had been problems with some perl/gcc versions
        - changed including of header files, so that <assert.h> is included before <perl.h>
          (import that assert.h doesn't overwrite Perl's assert in older gcc's)
        - removed own defined macros

0.06  Tue Feb 11
        - tried to add as many possibilities to explain all different gcc versions
          that assert.h is already included :-)

        - implemented legal_moves method

0.09  Tue Mar 4

         as there had been problems with some perl/gcc versions

       - changed __generate_moves(HV*, int, int) to
                 __generate_moves(HV*, SV*, SV*)

       - incremented internal buffer for the moves

       - moved Inline_Stack_Vars and Inline_Stack_Reset macros to the top
         in the used functions
