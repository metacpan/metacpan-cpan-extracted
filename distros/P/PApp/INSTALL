INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Installation is difficult, and this document is badly written, so keep
confident ;)


VERSIONS

I personally use this version of PApp with the following other software
packages (other perl modules are listed in the requirements section of the
Makefile.PL).

- apache-1.3.25
- mod_perl-1.25 (1.24 well-tested)
- perl 5.8.x (5.8.0 is buggy, but might work with small apps).
- mysql-3.23.31 (higher versions usually pose no problem);


REQUIREMENTS

- mysql (version 3.23+ recommended), other databases might work, but
  probably require small changes (I'd be interested to hear about
  problems, though!).

- mod_perl -OR- speedycgi
  mod_perl is the recommended and fastest way. if you can't get mod_perl, try
  the CGI::SpeedyCGI module. If even that fails, you could still use PApp,
  but it will not be funny for you (read: dog-slow).

- XML::Sablotron (from http://www.gingerall.com/charlie-bin/get/webGA/act/sablotron.act)
  This is optional but HIGHLY recommended (also, it is required for many applications
  and demos)


INSTALLATION STEP-BY-STEP

1. compile and install this module, as usual:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

2a. mod_perl:
   Configure apache, see the included eg/httpd.conf.
   Due to bugs in apache you must be sure to NOT build with expat-lite.
   A rm -rf lib/expat-lite on the right place should help. ;-)
   no component of apache uses expat statically and using it dynamically (i.e. 
   from XML::Parser) causes a segmentation fault.
   And do not forget to enable PERL_SECTIONS when configuring modperl
   (perl Makefile.PL PERL_SECTIONS=1)

2b. speedycgi:
   Much easier than mod_perl, only slightly slower: just copy eg/admin.cgi
   (for a single application) or eg/exec.cgi (for a whole appset) to
   your cgi directory and customize it (i.e. edit the bangpath and the
   app/appset name).

3. use papp-admin to configure papp for its first use
   First create an appset (usually default)
   ./papp-admin --addset default
   then add the first application
   ./papp-admin --app admin --appset default --path apps/admin.papp \
                --mount /admin

P.S: When first entering the Admin menu the User is: admin and
     password is: public 
     !!! PLEASE CHANGE THAT BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE !!!
