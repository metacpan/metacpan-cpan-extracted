Math-VectorXYZ

This module is designed for 3d vector math common to engineering
problems such as manipulating finite element data (forces and geometry),
calculating moments or perpendicular vectors using cross products, etc.
A 2d version of the module is also provided as Math::VectorXYZ::2D

The API is intended to be minimal and intuitive using common perl
operators where possible.

The module is a pure perl module with no non-core dependencies.
