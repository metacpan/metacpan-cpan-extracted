     my @file_list = $ar->list_files;

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a XS alternative to Archive::Ar that uses libarchive to
    read and write ar BSD, GNU and common ar archives.

    There is no standard for the ar format. Most modern archives are based
    on a common format with two extension variants, BSD and GNU. Other
    esoteric variants (such as AIX (small), AIX (big) and Coherent) vary
    significantly from the common format and are not supported. Debian's
    package format (.deb files) use the common format.

    The interface attempts to be identical (with a couple of minor
    extensions) to Archive::Ar and the documentation presented here is
    based on that module. The diagnostic messages issued on error mostly
    come directly from libarchive, so they will likely not match exactly
    what Archive::Ar would produce, but it should issue a warning under
    similar circumstances.

    The main advantage of Archive::Ar over this module is that it is
    written in pure perl, and thus does not require a compiler or
    libarchive. As an XS module using libarchive it may be faster.

    You may notice that the API to Archive::Ar::Libarchive and Archive::Ar
    is similar to Archive::Tar and this was done intentionally to keep
    similarity between the Archive::* modules.

METHODS

 new

     my $ar = Archive::Ar::Libarchive->new;
     my $ar = Archive::Ar::Libarchive->new($filename);
     my $ar = Archive::Ar::Libarchive->new($fh);

    Returns a new Archive::Ar::Libarchive object. Without a filename or
    glob, it returns an empty object. If passed a filename as a scalar or a
    GLOB, it will attempt to populate from either of those sources. If it
    fails, you will receive undef, instead of an object reference.

 set_opt

     $ar->set_opt($name, $value);

    Assign option $name value $value. Supported options include:

    warn

      Warning level. Levels are zero for no warnings, 1 for brief warnings,
      and 2 for warnings with a stack trace. Default is zero.

      Warnings that originate with libarchive itself will not include a
      stacktrace, even with a warn level set to 2.

    chmod

      Change the file permissions of files created when extracting. Default
      is true (non-zero).

      This option is provided only for compatibility with Archive::Ar.
      Libarchive does not provide an equivalent to this option, so setting
      it to false will has no effect.

    same_perms

      When setting file permissions, use the values in the archive
      unchanged. If false, removes setuid bits and applies the user's
      umask. Default is true.

      In Archive::Ar this option is true for root only.

    chown

      Change the owners of extracted files, if possible. Default is true.

    type

      Archive type. May be GNU, BSD or COMMON, or undef if no archive has
      been read. Defaults to the type of the archive read or undef.

    symbols

      Provide a filename for the symbol table, if present. If set, the
      symbol table is treated as a file that can be read from or written to
      an archive. It is an error if the filename provided matches the name
      of a file in the archive. If undef, the symbol table is ignored.
      Defaults to undef.

 get_opt

     my $value = $ar->get_opt($name);

    Returns the value of the option $name.

 type

     my $type = $ar->type;

    Returns the type of the ar archive. The type is undefined until an
    archive is loaded. If the archive displays characteristics of a
    GNU-style archive, GNU is returned. If it looks like a bsd-style
    archive, BSD is returned. Otherwise, COMMON is returned. Note that
    unless filenames exceed 16 characters in length, bsd archives look like
    the common format.

 clear

     $ar->clear;

    Clears the current in-memory archive.

 read

     my $br = $ar->read($filename);
     my $br = $ar->read($fh);

    This reads a new file into the object, removing any ar archive already
    represented in the object. The argument may be either a filename,
    filehandle or IO::Handle object. Returns the number of bytes read,
    undef on failure.

 read_memory

     my $br = $ar->read_memory($data);

    This reads information from the first parameter, and attempts to parse
    and treat it like an ar archive. Like Archive::Ar::Libarchive#read, it
    will wipe out whatever you have in the object and replace it with the
    contents of the new archive, even if it fails. Returns the number of
    bytes read (processed) if successful, undef otherwise.

 contains_file

     my $bool = $ar->contains_file($filename)

    Returns true if the archive contains a file with the name $filename.
    Returns undef otherwise.

 extract

     $ar->extract;

    Extract all files from the archive. Extracted files are assigned the
    permissions and modification time stored in the archive, and, if
    possible, the user and group ownership. Returns true on success, undef
    for failure.

 extract_file

     $ar->extract_file($filename);

    Extracts a single file from the archive. The extracted file is assigned
    the permissions and modification time stored in the archive, and, if
    possible, the user and group ownership. Returns true on success, undef
    for failure.

 rename

     $ar->rename($filename, $newname);

    Changes the name of a file in the in-memory archive.

 chmod

     $ar->chmod($filename, $mode);

    Change the permission mode of the member to $mode.

 chown

     $ar->chown($filename, $uid, $gid);
     $ar->chown($filename, $uid);

    Change the ownership of the member to user id $udi and (optionally)
    group id $gid. Negative id values are ignored.

 remove

     my $count = $ar->remove(@pathnames);
     my $count = $ar->remove(\@pathnames);

    The remove method takes a filenames as a list or as an arrayref, and
    removes them, one at a time, from the Archive::Ar object. This returns
    the number of files successfully removed from the archive.

 list_files

     my @list = $ar->list_files;
     my $list = $ar->list_files;

    This lists the files contained inside of the archive by filename, as an
    array. If called in a scalar context, returns a reference to an array.

 add_files

     $ar->add_files(@filenames);
     $ar->add_files(\@filenames);

    Takes an array or an arrayref of filenames to add to the ar archive, in
    order. The filenames can be paths to files, in which case the path
    information is stripped off. Filenames longer than 16 characters are
    truncated when written to disk in the format, so keep that in mind when
    adding files.

    Due to the nature of the ar archive format,
    Archive::Ar::Libarchive#add_files will store the uid, gid, mode, size,
    and creation date of the file as returned by stat.

    returns the number of files successfully added, or undef on failure.

 add_data

     my $size = $ar->add_data($filename, $data, $filedata);

    Takes an filename and a set of data to represent it. Unlike
    Archive::Ar::Libarchive#add_files, Archive::Ar::Libarchive#add_data is
    a virtual add, and does not require data on disk to be present. The
    data is a hash that looks like:

     $filedata = {
       uid  => $uid,   #defaults to zero
       gid  => $gid,   #defaults to zero
       date => $date,  #date in epoch seconds. Defaults to now.
       mode => $mode,  #defaults to 0100644;
     };

    You cannot add_data over another file however. This returns the file
    length in bytes if it is successful, undef otherwise.

 write

     my $content = $ar->write;
     my $size = $ar->write($filename);

    This method will return the data as an .ar archive, or will write to
    the filename present if specified. If given a filename,
    Archive::Ar::Libarchive#write will return the length of the file
    written, in bytes, or undef on failure. If the filename already exists,
    it will overwrite that file.

 get_content

     my $hash = get_content($filename);

    This returns a hash with the file content in it, including the data
    that the file would naturally contain. If the file does not exist or no
    filename is given, this returns undef. On success, a hash is returned
    with the following keys:

    name

      The file name

    date

      The file date (in epoch seconds)

    uid

      The uid of the file

    gid

      The gid of the file

    mode

      The mode permissions

    size

      The size (in bytes) of the file

    data

      The contained data

 get_data

     my $data = $ar->get_data($filename);

    Returns a scalar containing the file data of the given archive member.
    On error returns undef.

 get_handle

     my $handle = $ar->get_handle($filename);

    Returns a file handle to the in-memory file data of the given archive
    member. On error returns undef. This can be useful for unpacking nested
    archives.

 error

     my $error_string = $ar->error($trace);

    Returns the current error string, which is usually the last error
    reported. If a true value is provided, returns the error message and
    stack trace.
