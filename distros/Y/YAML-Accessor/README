YAML-Accessor version 0.3
==========================

I saw a need to integrate Class::Accessor with YAML::XS. You
may not see this need, but I wanted it and I use it for a piece
of code that sorely needs it. Here you go. Use it or don't.

People on IRC said it was a horrible idea. I rather like it.
