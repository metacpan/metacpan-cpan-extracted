Wx/SimplePlotter
================

This wxWidgets control plots points (e.g. function results) with different 
colors. It automatically scales its output according to the control size.

The points are passed as pairs of coordinates. Points are connected by lines 
when drawn.

The control has been tested on Mac OS X, but should work on other operating
systems (including Windows and Linux) as well.
