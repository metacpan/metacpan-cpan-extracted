NAME
    Data::Inherited - Hierarchy-wide accumulation of list and hash results

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      use base 'Data::Inherited';
      use constant PROPERTIES => (qw/name address/);

      package Bar;
      use base 'Foo';
      use constant PROPERTIES => (qw/age/);

      package main;
      my $bar = Bar->new;
      print "$_\n" for $bar->every_list('PROPERTIES');

      # prints:
      #
      # name
      # address
      # age

DESCRIPTION
    This is a mixin class. By inheriting from it you get two methods that
    are able to accumulate hierarchy-wide list and hash results.

METHODS
  every_list(String $method_name, Bool ?$override_cache = 0)
    Takes as arguments a method name (mandatory) and a boolean indicating
    whether to override the cache (optional, off by default)

    Causes every method in the object's hierarchy with the given name to be
    invoked. The resulting list is the combined set of results from all the
    methods, pushed together in top-to-bottom order (hierarchy-wise).

    "every_list()" returns a list in list context and an array reference in
    scalar context.

    The result is cached (per calling package) and the next time the method
    is called from the same package with the same method argument, the
    cached result is returned. This is to speed up method calls, because
    internally this module uses NEXT, which is quite slow. It is expected
    that "every_list()" is used for methods returning static lists (object
    defaults, static class definitions and such). If you want to override
    the caching mechanism, you can provide the optional second argument. The
    result is cached in any case.

    See the synopsis for an example.

  every_hash(String $method_name, Bool ?$override_cache = 0)
    Takes as arguments a method name (mandatory) and a boolean indicating
    whether to override the cache (optional, off by default)

    Causes every method in the object's hierarchy with the given name to be
    invoked. The resulting hash is the combined set of results from all the
    methods, overlaid in top-to-bottom order (hierarchy-wise).

    "every_hash()" returns a hash in list context and a hash reference in
    scalar context.

    The cache and the optional cache override argument work like with
    "every_list()".

    Example:

      package Person;
      use base 'Data::Inherited';

      sub new {
        my $class = shift;
        my $self = bless {}, $class;
        my %args = @_;
        %args = ($self->every_hash('DEFAULTS'), %args);
        $self->$_($args{$_}) for keys %args;
        $self;
      };

      sub DEFAULTS {
        first_name => 'John',
        last_name  => 'Smith',
      };

      package Employee;
      use base 'Person';

      sub DEFAULTS {
        salary => 10_000,
      }

      package LocatedEmployee;
      use base 'Employee';

      # Note: no default for address, but different salary

      sub DEFAULTS {
        salary     => 20_000,
        first_name => 'Johan',
      }

      package main;
      my $p = LocatedEmployee->new;

      # salary: 20000
      # first_name: Johan
      # last_name: Smith

  flush_every_cache_by_key(String $key)
    Deletes the cache entry for the given key.
