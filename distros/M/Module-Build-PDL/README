Module-Build-PDL version 0.0.3

The purpose of Module::Build::PDL is to provide a Module::Build
style avenue for creating PDL distributions.  PDL has its own filetype,
.pd, which needs to be processed to generate .xs and .pm files.
Module::Build::PDL handles all of that.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


AUTHOR TESTS

The author tests are located in the directory xt.  I would like to add
authortests as a build target, but until I get there, here are two commands
you can use to run them (either one should work fine):

	prove xt/*
	./Build test --test_files 'xt/*'


DEPENDENCIES

This module depends on Module::Build and PDL.
