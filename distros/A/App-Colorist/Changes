    * Bugfix: Errors in rule sets choked when trying to call croak instead of
      croaking with a nice error describing the problem.
    * Bugfix: Optional matches can leave indexes in @- and @+ as undef, which
      caused colorist to spew ugly warnings. This should no longer occur.

    * Bugfix: "Fixes" a problem with colorist.t hanging on Win32. The fix is
      that it detects that the system is MSWin32 and dies. I have made no effort
      to make this work on Win32.
