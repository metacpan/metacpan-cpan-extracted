          indexing of the changes made in 1.6.1.

v1.6.1  2011-12-16

        - Prevented locking twice a queue element.

v1.4.0  2010-08-05
        - Fixed problem with the internal max_id cache preventing runaway
          dequeueing (dequeue-enqueue-dequeue would fail on the last dequeue to
          see the last enqueued element when using the same $queue object).

v1.3.0  2010-08-03
        - Added option to limit how many times a queue element can be requeued
          before it stops being pulled.

        - Modified requeue() - returns error without a die() to indicate a
          problem that is not the responsibility of this module.
        - Improved algorithm to detect possible parallelization conflicts.
