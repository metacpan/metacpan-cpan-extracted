NAME

    CGI::Emulate::PSGI - PSGI adapter for CGI

SYNOPSIS

        my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler(sub {
            # Existing CGI code
        });

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows an application designed for the CGI environment to
    run in a PSGI environment, and thus on any of the backends that PSGI
    supports.

    It works by translating the environment provided by the PSGI
    specification to one expected by the CGI specification. Likewise, it
    captures output as it would be prepared for the CGI standard, and
    translates it to the format expected for the PSGI standard using
    CGI::Parse::PSGI module.

CGI.pm

    If your application uses CGI, be sure to cleanup the global variables
    in the handler loop yourself, so:

        my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler(sub {
            use CGI;
            CGI::initialize_globals();
            my $q = CGI->new;
            # ...
        });

    Otherwise previous request variables will be reused in the new
    requests.

    Alternatively, you can install and use CGI::Compile from CPAN and
    compiles your existing CGI scripts into a sub that is perfectly ready
    to be converted to PSGI application using this module.

      my $sub = CGI::Compile->compile("/path/to/script.cgi");
      my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler($sub);

    This will take care of assigning a unique namespace for each script
    etc. See CGI::Compile for details.

    You can also consider using CGI::PSGI but that would require you to
    slightly change your code from:

      my $q = CGI->new;
      # ...
      print $q->header, $output;

    into:

      use CGI::PSGI;
    
      my $app = sub {
          my $env = shift;
          my $q = CGI::PSGI->new($env);
          # ...
          return [ $q->psgi_header, [ $output ] ];
      };

    See CGI::PSGI for details.

METHODS

    handler

        my $app = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->handler($code);

      Creates a PSGI application code reference out of CGI code reference.

    emulate_environment

        my %env = CGI::Emulate::PSGI->emulate_environment($env);

      Creates an environment hash out of PSGI environment hash. If your
      code or framework just needs an environment variable emulation, use
      this method like:

        local %ENV = (%ENV, CGI::Emulate::PSGI->emulate_environment($env));
        # run your application

      If you use handler method to create a PSGI environment hash, this is
      automatically called in the created application.
