 * Replace function calls with method calls.

0.42 2016-01-05 pjacklam

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ...".

   these. We want to be compatible. Add tests to "infnan.inc".

0.41 2015-09-25 pjacklam

 * fix #27059: t/option_l.t fails

 * on Perl 5.9.4 or later: "overload" hex() and oct() with lexical routines

   routines that work with big integers

 * make bignum.pm and bigrat.pm re-use code from bigint.pm
