Hash/Merge version $Revision: 0.12 $
=========================================

Hash::Merge merges two arbitrarily deep hashes into a single hash.  That
is, at any level, it will add non-conflicting key-value pairs from one
hash to the other, and follows a set of specific rules when there are key
value conflicts (as outlined below).  The hash is followed recursively,
so that deeply nested hashes that are at the same level will be merged 
when the parent hashes are merged.

Please see the POD for the module for additional information.
