POE::Component::Server::AsyncEndpoint version 0.10
==================================================

DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to create Asynchronous Outbound WebServices
pushing the info to an MQ.

It implements an asynchronous endpoint server to help deploy
asynchronous web services in SOA architectures. Even though it may
resemble many features of the so-called Enterprise Service Bus, it is
actually the opposite of an ESB in the sense it does not try to
centralize on "a" bus but rather in a decentralized fashion. 

Please read the POD documentation for a more thorough description.
