NAME

    Compress::LZW - Pure-Perl implementation of scaling LZW

VERSION

    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS

     use Compress::LZW;
      
     my $compressed = compress($some_data);
     my $data       = decompress($compressed);

DESCRIPTION

    Compress::LZW is a perl implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch
    compression algorithm, which should no longer be patented worldwide. It
    is shooting for loose compatibility with the flavor of LZW found in the
    classic UNIX compress(1), though there are a few variations out there
    today. I test against ncompress on Linux x86.

FUNCTIONS

 compress

    Accepts a scalar, returns compressed data in a scalar.

    Wraps Compress::LZW::Compressor

 decompress

    Accepts a (compressed) scalar, returns decompressed data in a scalar.

    Wraps Compress::LZW::Decompressor

EXPORTS

    Default: compress decompress

SEE ALSO

    The implementations, Compress::LZW::Compressor and
    Compress::LZW::Decompressor.

    Other Compress::* modules, especially Compress::LZV1, Compress::LZF and
    Compress::Zlib.

    I definitely studied some other implementations that deserve credit, in
    particular: Sean O'Rourke, <SEANO> - Original author,
    Compress::SelfExtracting, and another by Rocco Caputo which was posted
    online.
