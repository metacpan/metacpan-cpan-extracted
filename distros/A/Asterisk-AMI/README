Asterisk::AMI
================

DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface to the Asterisk Manager Interface. It's goal is to provide a flexible, powerful, and
reliable way to interact with Asterisk upon which other applications may be built. It utilizes AnyEvent and therefore can
integrate very easily into event-based applications, but still provides blocking functions for use with standard scripting.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	AnyEvent version 5.0 or higher
	AnyEvent::Handle
	AnyEvent::Socket
	Digest::MD5
	Scalar::Util
        Carp
	version
	parent

Note on SSL Support:

For SSL support you will also need the module that AnyEvent::Handle uses for SSL support, which is not a required dependency.
Currently that module is 'Net::SSLeay' (AnyEvent:Handle version 5.251) but it may change in the future.

Note on SSL Support for CentOS/Redhat:

If the version of Net:SSLeay included in CentOS/Redhat does not work try installing an updated version from CPAN.
