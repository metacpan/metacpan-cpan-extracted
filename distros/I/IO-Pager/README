IO::Pager & IO::Pager::Perl
=====================

IO::Pager - Select a pager and pipe text to it if destination is a TTY
IO::Pager::Perl - A pure perl pager engine

IO::Pager::Perl is used in the IO::Pager::less IO::Pager subclass,
but is also a free-standing library ready to be incorporated into
other code.

IO::Pager is lightweight and can be used to locate an available pager
and set the PAGER environment variable sanely or as a factory for
creating objects defined elsewhere such as IO::Pager::Buffered,
IO::Pager::Unbuffered, and IO::Pager::less which provides a pure perl
pager.

IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether
or not to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in PAGER.
Subclasses may inherit from IO::Pager, and implement the IO handle
methods desired.

PORTABILITY

IO::Pager is intended to be as portable as possible, I've tested it on numerous
platform and perl version combinations. Most work fine though you may run
into quirks, it tends to be happiest under perl built with perlio not stdio.
