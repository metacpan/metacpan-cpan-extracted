SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Delicious;
      use Log::Dispatch::Screen;

      my $del = Net::Delicious->new({user => "foo",
                                     pswd => "bar"});

      foreach my $p ($del->recent_posts()) {
          print $p->description()."\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    OOP for the del.icio.us API

PACKAGE METHODS
  __PACKAGE__->new(\%args || Config::Simple)
    Arguments to the Net::Delicious object may be defined in one of three
    ways :

    *   As a single hash reference

    *   As a reference to a *Config::Simple* object

    *   As a path to a file that may be read by the *Config::Simple*.

    The first option isn't going away any time soon but should be considered
    as deprecated. Valid hash reference arguments are :

    *   user

        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us username.

    *   pswd

        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us password.

    *   updates

        String.

        The path to a directory where the timestamp for the last update to
        your bookmarks can be recorded. This is used by the *all_posts*
        method to prevent abusive requests.

        Default is the current user's home directory; If the home directory
        can not be determined Net::Delicious will use a temporary directory
        as determined by File::Temp.

    *   debug

        Boolean.

        Add a *Log::Dispatch::Screen* dispatcher to log debug (and higher)
        notices. Notices will be printed to STDERR.

    *Config::Simple* options are expected to be grouped in a "block" labeled
    delicious. Valid options are :

    *   user

        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us username.

    *   pswd

        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us password.

    *   updates

        String.

        The path to a directory where the timestamp for the last update to
        your bookmarks can be recorded. This is used by the *all_posts*
        method to prevent abusive requests.

        Default is the current user's home directory, followed by a
        temporary directory as determined by File::Temp.

    *   xml_parser

        String.

        You may specify one of three XML parsers to use to handle response
        messages from the del.icio.us servers. You many want to do this if,
        instead of Perl-ish objects, you want to access the raw XML and
        parse it with XPath or XSLT or some other crazy moon language.

        *   simple

            This uses XML::Simple to parse messages. If present, all
            successful API method calls will return, where applicable,
            Net::Delicious::* objects.

        *   libxml

            This uses XML::LibXML to parse messages. If present, all
            successful API method calls will return a
            *XML::LibXML::Document* object.

            Future releases may allow responses parsed with libxml to be
            returned as Net::Delicious::* objects.

        *   xpath

            This uses XML::XPath to parse messages. If present, all
            successful API method calls will return a *XML::XPath* object.

            Future releases may allow responses parsed with XML::XPath to be
            returned as Net::Delicious::* objects.

        The default value is simple.

    *   force_xml_objects

        Boolean.

        Set to true if you are using XML::Simple to parse response messages
        from the del.icio.us servers but want to return the object's
        original data structure rather than Net::Delicious::* objects.

        Default is false.

    *   endpoint

        String.

        Set the endpoint for all API calls.

        There's no particular reason you should ever need to set this
        unless, say, this module falls horribly out of date with the API
        itself. Anyway, now you can.

        Default is https://api.del.icio.us/v1/

    *   debug

        Boolean.

        Add a *Log::Dispatch::Screen* dispatcher to log debug (and higher)
        notices. Notices will be printed to STDERR.

    Returns a Net::Delicious object or undef if there was a problem creating
    the object.

    It is also possible to set additional config options to tweak the
    default settings for API call parameters and API response properties.
    Please consult the POD for Net::Delicious::Config for details.

  $obj->config(@args)
    This is just a short-cut for calling the current object's internal

    destroyed.

  $obj->username()
    Returns the del.icio.us username for the current object.

  $obj->password()
    Returns the del.icio.us password for the current object.

  $object->user_agent()
    This returns the objects internal LWP::UserAgent in case you need to
    tweak timeouts, proxies, etc.

    By default the UA object enables the *proxy_env* glue.

ERRORS
    Errors are logged via the object's *logger* method which returns a
    *Log::Dispatch* object. If you want to get at the errors it is up to you
    to provide it with a dispatcher.
