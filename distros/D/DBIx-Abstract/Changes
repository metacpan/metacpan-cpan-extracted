Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Abstract.

1.04   2014-01-15
	- Explicitly order options hashes to make log output deterministic.

1.03   2014-01-14
        - We were explicitly returning undef for failure, which is basically
          always wrong.  Corrected this.

1.02   2014-01-14
	- Update documentation, etc, to point to github version
	- Make SQL generation deterministic, rather than depending on hash
	  order, to ease testing and predictability.
	- Misc minor code cleanups.
	- Move to more of my standard Dist::Zilla config.

1.01   2011-08-23
        - Update to modern build practices.
        - Make tests work with SQLite, so they don't need to be configured.
        - Document its depricated status.

1.006  2005-04-23
        - Fixed a bug discovered by Jan Martin Mathiassen
          <reaper@mindriot.as>.  If you pass in a password but no username
          it's supposed to ignore the password.  Instead it was clearing it
          in the hash that you passed in but still using it.
        - Removed Test::More and Test::Builder from the distribution-- put
          Test::Simple in the prerequisites.

1.005  2003-03-14 -- The "I broke the build and install process" release
       - Fixed a stupid problem where Test::Builder and Test::More would be
         installed by this package.  Ack.
       - Made the Makefile.PL default to not providing a database driver. 
         Tests will be skipped if you do this.  (This way automated module
         testing won't break when it shouldn't.)
       - Added a dependency on Scalar::Util.

1.004  2003-02-17
       - ensure_connection did not work correctly if DBI was set to die on
         errors.
       - Back ported test suite and makefile from 1.1.  Back ported patch to
         fix mysqlPP compatibility issues.
       - Made clone weaken references it takes so that it won't leak memory. 
         Added memory leak test.
       - A bug fix relating to select_one_* and select_all_* where if the
         query failed and returned undef, the routine would crash.  This is
         now fixed and it just propagates the undef.

1.003  2002-09-23
       - Fixed Win32 bug found by Kanji T Bates.
       - Connect for oracle can look a bit more like those for other DBD
         drivers now.  You may now specify your SID in the dbname field.

1.002  2001-09-05
       - Fixed bug introduced in 1.001 where trying to read ->opt always
         produced undef.

1.001  2001-09-05
       - Made it so that opt can now take any DBI attribute.

1.000  2001-09-04
       - Now produces a better error that config/DSN is not defined.
       - When the DBIx::Abstract object is destroyed it usually closes any
         associated database handles (if it's the last clone alive), now it
         will only do this if it created the handle.  This way, if you pass
         in a handle it will survive its use by DBIx::Abstract.

0.96   2001-07-07
       - Fixed stupid bug that made it not accept DBI handles.  I can't
         believe I actually took eight months to check this in.

0.95   2000-11-12
       - Changed how CVSVERSION and LAST_CHANGE are calculated.             
       - Made it so that you can pass routines literal strings instead of
         variables (variables are used with bind_params when possible) by
         passing a scalar reference.
       - I also allow array references to do this (in some circumstances)
         but this is deprecated.
       - Made connect optionally accept DBI handles instead of connection
         info, by recommendation of Mark Stosberg <mark@summersault.com>.
       - Changed how self was obtained to be (IMHO) stylistically better.

0.94   2000-08-04
        - Removed an annoying warn that only shows up unpredictably.  I
          think it has to do with Perls garbage collection not working the
          way I thought it worked.  Meanwhile I may have fixed the
          undocumented dataseek method.  But probably not.
        - Made it so that updates and inserts can produce nulls, eg:
            $dbh->update('foo',{bar=>undef});
          Would set the 'bar' column to NULL.
        - Fixed tyop, s/STOCK TRACE/STACK TRACE/g.
        - Made connected method safer.  It won't crash if the DBI handle is
          invalid or non-existent.


0.93   2000-04-17
        - Fixed a problem with cloning.  Clones other then the first clone
          were getting a copy of the clone list.  This caused unexpected
          calls to the classes DESTROY method.  This produced warnings, but
          there shouldn't have been any errors.

0.921  2000-04-07
        - Well I managed to check in the last version without including the
          bug fix.
        - Added select_one_to_array and select_one_to_arrayref.
        - Fixed a nasty little bug involving CLONES.  It had been failing to
          register clones of clones.  This was causing a memory leak.

0.920  2000-04-07
        - Added ability to inserts with literal values.

0.910  2000-03-31
        - Fixed bug in make test that caused it to fail when a password was
          needed for testing.  This didn't effect me as my database accepts
          anonymous connections to the test database over loopback.
        - Fixed some warnings when username or password were undefined.

0.900  2000-03-03
        - Changed name to DBIx::Abstract in preparation for addition to
          CPAN.
        - Updated README to be accurate regarding the current version.
        - Fixed a bug where an empty where would produce invalid SQL.
        - Changed version to reflect the fact that it is VERY close to being
          ready for 1.0.

0.079  2000-03-03
        - Fixed a bug where an empty where would produce invalid SQL.
        - Fixed a bug that caused death under S

0.078  2000-02-18
        - Added 'saveSQL' option which, with each query, stuffs the generated
          SQL into the 'lastsql' key in the self payload.
        - Changed logging code for sql to log a single string (with quoted
          parameters) instead of a string with ?'s and a bind_params array.

0.07.7 2000-01-19
        - Fixed some memory leaks (these were only a problem if you were
          creating SQL::DBI objects in a loop).
        - Moved from test.pl to t/basic.t for better testing.

0.07.6 1999-12-29
        - Another dumb bug... tried calling __logwrite before I had actually
          created the SQL::DBI object.

0.07.5 1999-12-21
        - Found stupid bug where if you called a statement handle specific
          method before doing a query (and creating one) it would crash. 
          Normally I would shrug my shoulders and say "Don't be dumb", but
          it is handy to be able to call "finish" regardless.

0.07.4 1999-12-09
        - Made select_one_to_hashref and select_all_to_hashref accept the same
          parameters as select.
        - Made select accept both table and tables, as well as field and
          fields.

0.07.3 1999-12-03
        - Fixed bug Mike <michael@mint.net> found in the new special happy
          join syntax.  Maybe I should have tested it.  Created more bugs,
          then fixed those too.

0.07.2 1999-11-02
        - Fixed the bug JasonJ <kyroraz@jmac.org> found.  The connected and 
          the reconnect methods were failing due to a call to logwrite (the
          real method name is __logwrite).  I've also added tests for this
          to the 'make test'.
        - Added "join" and "group" params to select.  This allows group bys
          and easier joins.

0.07.1 1999-07-28
        - Made it so that wheres can have arrays nested in them.
        - Added code to make where generation code easier to debug.

0.07.0 1999-06-25
        - Changed version numbering system so that I can have major and
          minor releases more easily.
        - Fixed a warning in select about a twice 'my'ed variable, thanks
          Jmac.
        - Fixed a bug that stopped people from passing a DBI data_source to
          connect.
        - Fixed logging to include @bind_params.
        - Added warnings to test
        - Changed all doubled quoted strings that didn't need to be double
          quoted single quotes.
        - Changed connect to log if it fails to connect.  Improved die if
          SQL::DBI is unable to create a data source.        
        - Added method ``connected''.  It returns true if dbh->{'Active'} is
          true.
        - Added method ``reconnect''.  Reconnects if this object has been
          connected before.
        - Added method ``ensure_connection''.  Ensures that the object is
          connected and that the connection is valid (by doing a ``SELECT
          1'').  Tries to reconnect if it isn't connected.  Dies if it is
          unable to provide a connection.
        - Changed select so that table is optional.  That is, db->select(1)
          will produce ``SELECT 1'' instead of ``SELECT 1 FROM''
        - Updated documentation to reflect that loglevel 0 is used for fatal 
          errors.

0.06   1999-04-23
        - Fixed documentation where it used "is like" instead of "like".
        - Modified all routines to use bind_params instead of 'quote'.
          This should only effect users in positive ways, if at all.
        - Changed connect to use 'dbname' instead of 'db' for compatibility
          with ODBC.  This change won't break legacy code: If you use 'db' it
          will be renamed to 'dbname' for you.
        - Changed DEFAULT connect type to simply generate an arbitrary
          data_source based on the config hash you pass.  So if you pass:
          { driver=>'foo', bar=>'baz', blat='bar' }
          Your data_source will be dbi:foo:bar=baz;blat=bar

0.05   1999-03-23
        - Added "kill kill kill" and "die die die" as per jak's suggestion.
        - Changed "kill kill kill" and "die die die" to all caps as per
          jmac's suggestion.
        - Added a few, undocumented "Mysql" compatibility functions
        - Made insert, replace and update accept scalars as well as hashses
          for all of their parameters.
        - Documented the new alternative interface for passing all
          parameters.
        - Fixed bug in changes file... 0.03 and 0.04 were listed with the
          wrong dates.

0.04   1999-02-26
        - Added commit and rollback pass throughs.
        - Added 'AutoCommit' option which works like DBH hash value, with
          one difference:  It will warn instead of die if you give it an invalid
          value.
        - Added DESTROY method.  Now handles finish and disconnect calls on
          its own.

0.03   1999-02-23
        - Changed method of selecting the DBI datasource, should be easier
          to add new datasources now.
        - Now allows the datasource to be passed in as a scalar (for
          databases not explicitly supported).  This should allow this
          module to work with any database supported by DBI.
        - Now stores all of the information used to create the DBI
          connection just in case we need it later.
        - Changed fetchrow_hash to return values the same way
          Mysql->fetchhash does.  This should stop
          'while(%hash=$db->fetchrow_hash)' constructs from breaking.
        - Added dataseek function.  Currently this is only useful with the
          mysql driver, which is why it isn't documented yet.  Hopefully
          something like this is available with the other database drivers,
          however if it isn't then i will remove it.  (So don't use it yet!)
        - Removed undocumented "join" feature of select.  It was possible to
          do it without an extra feature.
        - Made all functions accept hashes as well as parameter lists.  This
          will be reaching the documentation in the next release, once it's
          a bit more polished.

0.02a  1999-01-20
        - Argh.  Made it so that you can actually do a 'make install'.
          (Broke with change to SQL::DBI.)

0.02   1999-01-14
        - Changed name to SQL:DBI from Shashou.

0.01   1999-01-06
        - Built a proper package for the module using h2xs
        - Moved change log to 'Changes' file.
        - Added the ability to support drivers other then MySQL.  Now has
          PostgreSQL support.

0.00   1999-01-05
        - Added CHANGE LOG section.
        - Started versioning (version 0.0)
        - Moved PERLDOC section to bottom
        - Made methods return $self my default
        - Improved examples
