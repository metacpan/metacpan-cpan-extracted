NAME
    Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339 - Test RFC3339 timestamps are within a
    certain tolerance

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Deep;
        use Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339;

        my $now    = DateTime->now;
        my $record = create_record(...);
        cmp_deeply $record, { created => datetime_rfc3339($now, '5s') },
            'Created is within 5 seconds of current time';

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339 provides a single function,
    "datetime_rfc3339", which is used with Test::Deep to check that the
    string value gotten is an RFC3339-compliant timestamp. It can also check
    if the timestamp is equal to, or within optional tolerances of, an
    expected timestamp.

    RFC3339 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339> was chosen because it is a
    sane subset of ISO8601's kitchen-sink.

FUNCTIONS
  datetime_rfc3339
    Without arguments, the value is only checked to be a parseable RFC3339
    timestamp.

    Otherwise, this function takes a DateTime object or an RFC3339 timestamp
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339> string parseable by
    DateTime::Format::RFC3339 as the required first argument and a
    DateTime::Duration object or a
    DateTime::Format::Duration::DurationString-style string (e.g. "5s", "1h
    5m", "2d") representing a duration as an optional second argument. The
    second argument is used as a ± tolerance centered on the expected
    datetime. If a tolerance is provided, the timestamp being tested must
    fall within the closed interval for the test to pass. Otherwise, the
    timestamp being tested must match the expected datetime.

    All comparisons and date math are done in UTC, as advised by
    "How-DateTime-Math-Works" in DateTime. If this causes problems for you,
    please tell me about it via bug-Test-Deep-DateTime-RFC3339 *at*
    rt.cpan.org.

    Returns a Test::Deep::DateTime::RFC3339 object, which is a
    Test::Deep::Cmp, but you shouldn't need to care about those internals.
    You can, however, reuse the returned object if desired.

    Exported by default.
