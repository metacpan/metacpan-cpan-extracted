=head1 NAME

     Tk::SlideShow - a Perl Module for building presentation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

	This module is for building presentation, that will be as
interactive or good looking as Applix or PowerPoint one. The way of
using it is complety different on the other hand.

=head1 INSTALL

CPAN Perl standard way of intalling :

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Warning there is a test on font availability that 
takes a lot of time depending on how many font families you
have installed on your X11 distribution.

On my P90 linux box it takes about 6 minutes and block my X11 server
during that time. Actually, I got all freefont and sharefont set.
