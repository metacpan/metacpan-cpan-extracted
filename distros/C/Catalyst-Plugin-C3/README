NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::C3 - Catalyst Plugin to subvert NEXT to use Class::C3

SYNOPSIS
    Use it in an application:

      package MyCatApp;
      use Catalyst qw/ -Debug C3 Static::Simple /;

    Use it in another plugin:

      package Catalyst::Plugin::FooBar;
      use base qw/ Catalyst::Plugin::C3 /;

DESCRIPTION
    *** WARNING *** THIS MODULE IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL !!!

    This module is related to the possible transition of Catalyst from NEXT
    to Class::C3. This transition hasn't happened yet, and might not for a
    while.

    This module is only intended for use by Catalyst module developers at
    this time. You would know it if you should be using this module.

    *** END WARNING ***

    This module makes the use of the following idiom:

      use NEXT;

      sub foo {
        my $self = shift->NEXT::foo(@_);
      }

    actually accomplish something more like:

      use Class::C3;

      sub foo {
        my $self = shift->next::method(@_);
      }

    It does this by temporarily replacing "AUTOLOAD" in NEXT during the
    entire Catalyst request-handling phase. The behavior of the replacement
    function is dependant upon the class (or the class of the object) that
    NEXT was being called on.

    If the class is not Catalyst-related, the function falls back to normal
    NEXT behavior. If the class is Catalyst-related, but its inheritance
    hierarchy is not C3-compatible, the function warns about the situation
    (once per class per interpreter) and again falls back to normal NEXT
    behavior.

    If the class is both Catalyst-related and has a C3-compatible hierarchy,
    then NEXT calls are silently upgraded to their Class::C3 equivalents.

    The difference between "$self->NEXT::foo()" and
    "$self->NEXT::ACTUAL::foo()" is preserved (the former becomes
    "maybe::next::method" and the latter becomes "next::method").

    If you are going to place this module in your plugins list for a
    Catalyst app, it is best placed at the top of the list, above all other
    plugins.

    Some other plugins may need require this plugin as a base-class in order
    to transition themselves to Class::C3 without worrying about being
    broken by other plugins which haven't made the transition. Most plugins
    will *not* need to do so. Any that do would have wierd hacks involving
    "*{NEXT::NEXT}" in them prior to their C3 conversion, so you'd know it.

    In other words, a plugin should only base on this plugin if it needed
    NEXT hacks to work right under NEXT, and you're transitioning it to use
    Class::C3.

METHODS
  handle_request
    This plugin hooks into the "handle_request" method, sets up a "local"
    override of the standard version of "AUTOLOAD" in NEXT for the entire
    request.

CAVEAT
    Because calculating the MRO of every class every time ->NEXT::foo is
    used from within it is too expensive, runtime manipulations of @ISA are
    prohibited.
