NAME

    JSON::MaybeUTF8 - provide explicit text/UTF-8 JSON functions

SYNOPSIS

     use JSON::MaybeUTF8 qw(:v1);
     binmode STDOUT, ':encoding(UTF-8)';
     binmode STDERR, ':raw';
     (*STDOUT)->print(encode_json_text({ text => '...' }));
     (*STDERR)->print(encode_json_utf8({ text => '...' }));

DESCRIPTION

    Combines JSON::MaybeXS with Unicode::UTF8 to provide 4 functions that
    handle the combinations of JSON and UTF-8 encoding/decoding.

    The idea is to make the UTF-8-or-not behaviour more explicit in code
    that deals with multiple transport layers such as database, cache and
    I/O.

    This is a trivial wrapper around two other modules.

 BOM removal

    The $JSON::Maybe::UTF8::REMOVE_BOM flag is set by default due to
    https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/125. If you would
    prefer to disable this, add $JSON::Maybe::UTF8::REMOVE_BOM = 0; in your
    code.

    Note that this only affects things when Cpanel::JSON::XS is used
    (preferred by JSON::MaybeXS if it can be loaded).

 decode_json_utf8

    Given a UTF-8-encoded JSON byte string, returns a Perl data structure.
    May optionally remove the UTF-8 BOM
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8> if it exists.

 encode_json_utf8

    Given a Perl data structure, returns a UTF-8-encoded JSON byte string.

 decode_json_text

    Given a JSON string composed of Unicode characters (in Perl's internal
    encoding), returns a Perl data structure.

 encode_json_text

    Given a Perl data structure, returns a JSON string composed of Unicode
    characters (in Perl's internal encoding).
