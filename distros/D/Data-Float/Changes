  [Documentation]
  - Added a security policy.

  - convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

  - add MYMETA.json to .gitignore

v0.011 2010-10-21

  - port to Perl 5.13.6, where changed behaviour of signed zeroes in
    Perl arithmetic broke nextdown() and nextafter() and caused false
    test failures for several other functions

v0.010 2010-07-26

  - use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  - in documentation, use the term "truth value" instead of the less
    precise "boolean"

  - check for required Perl version at runtime

  - use full stricture in test suite

  - use full stricture in Build.PL

  - in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  - remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  - add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

v0.009 2008-04-06

  - refer to optional constants more carefully in the code, to avoid
    syntax problems on systems that lack infinities and NaNs

  - fix a skip count that caused false test failures on systems lacking
    signed zeroes

v0.008 2008-04-02

  - bugfix: in initialisation, correctly override any ambient
    $SIG{__DIE__}

v0.007 2007-10-02

  - close DATA filehandle when finished reading from it

  - fix some tests that were producing false failures on perl 5.6

v0.006 2007-10-01

  - bugfix: change behaviour of nextafter() when both arguments are
    numerically zero to that specified by IEEE 754: the second argument
    is returned rather than the first

  - bugfix: in hex_float(), cleanly reject non-ASCII digits in exponent

  - bugfix: in float_hex(), cleanly reject non-ASCII digits in an
    "EXPONENT="-type "zero_strategy" setting

  - add IEEE 754r functions nextup() and nextdown()

  - add IEEE 754r function totalorder()

  - add constant max_number

  - hex_float(): accept IEEE 754r special input strings "infinity" and
    "snan", in addition to the existing "inf" and "nan"

  - hex_float(): make the "0x" prefix in hexadecimal input optional

  - float_hex(): new option "hex_prefix_string" to control the "0x" prefix

  - test classification functions, examination functions, string
    conversion functions, and manipulation functions (all the functions
    that were not being tested)

  - test all functions for lack of side effects on zero arguments and
    purity of zero results

  - in documentation, note new standard-conforming behaviour of copysign()
    with a NaN second argument

  - in documentation, note that hex_float() accepts the special "0.0"
    form of input without a sign, as well as with one

  - in documentation, where the IEEE standard nature of functions is
    noted, add discussion of non-conforming behaviour on NaNs

  - in documentation, change some variable names in the synopsis for
    clarity

  - test POD syntax and coverage, and rename some internal functions to
    satisfy the coverage test

  - tweak tests on constants to avoid infinite loops if importing constant
    functions fails

  - build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  - complete dependency list

  - include signature in distribution

  - in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

v0.005 2007-01-25

  - bugfix: change behaviour of copysign() with a NaN as the second
    argument to that specified by IEEE 754: it is not an error but
    (in the context of Perl's opaque NaNs) results in copying an
    unpredictable sign

  - add hex_float() function to input floating point values in hexadecimal

  - add IEEE 754 function signbit()

  - float_id_cmp(): tighten specification of return values to match
    Perl's <=> operator (actual behaviour always matched the tighter spec,
    it just wasn't documented and tested)

  - in documentation, note that the string values of float arguments
    are ignored

  - in documentation, clarify note about implicit conversion of integer
    to float

  - in documentation, note that both arguments to nextafter() must be
    floating point values

  - in documentation, note standard nature of signbit(), copysign(),
    and nextafter()

  - in documentation, note float_id_cmp()'s relation to the IEEE 754r
    function totalorder()

  - in documentation, note that Perl does not distinguish between
    different NaNs

  - in documentation, give a second definition of max_integer (equivalent
    to the first)

  - add test for consistency of constants

  - in documentation, reference Scalar::Number

  - remove now-useless test t/use.t

v0.004 2007-01-12

  - bugfix: correct value for max_integer to 2^(significand_bits+1),
    and correct its description in the documentation

  - make pos_zero and neg_zero constants into non-constant functions
    that return fresh floating point zeroes, if running on a Perl where
    floating point zeroes can transmogrify into integer zeroes

  - add float_id_cmp() function for total ordering of floats

  - in documentation, more details of behaviour of zeroes

  - in documentation, discussion of interaction with native integer values

  - in documentation, note truncating behaviour of the % operator

  - in documentation, note the slightly misleading nature of the names
    "significand_bits" and "max_integer"

  - reference Data::Integer and perlnumber(1) in documentation

v0.003 2006-08-08

  - float_hex(): add OPTIONS parameter to control details of output
    formatting

  - when looking for NaNs, see whether the string "nan" qualifies

  - slight clarification to documentation of significand_step

v0.002 2006-08-03

  - bugfix: in mult_pow2(), copysign(), and nextafter(), take care
    to return a pristine signed zero when returning zero: they were
    returning zeroes that got broken (due to the Perl bug noted in the
    documentation) by internal arithmetic

v0.001 2006-08-01

  - add IEEE 754 functions copysign() and nextafter()

  - test sign of zero using sprintf() to avoid being confused by dualvars

  - slight expansion of initial paragraph of documentation

v0.000 2006-07-30

  - initial released version
