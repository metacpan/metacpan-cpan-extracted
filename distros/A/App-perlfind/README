NAME

    App::perlfind - A more knowledgeable perldoc

SYNOPSIS

        # perlfind UNIVERSAL::isa
        # (runs `perldoc perlobj`)
    
        # Include features of cpandoc and perldoc:
    
        # perlfind File::Find
        # perlfind -m Acme::BadExample | grep system
        # vim `perlfind -l Web::Scraper`
        # perlfind -q FAQ Keyword

DESCRIPTION

    perlfind is like cpandoc and therefore also like perldoc except it
    knows about more things. Try these:

        perlfind xor
        perlfind foreach
        perlfind isa
        perlfind AUTOLOAD
        perlfind TIEARRAY
        perlfind INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR
        perlfind '$^F'
        perlfind '\Q'
        perlfind PERL5OPT
        perlfind :mmap
        perlfind __WARN__
        perlfind __PACKAGE__
        perlfind head4
        perlfind UNITCHECK

    If perlfind doesn't know about a search term, it will delegate the
    search to Pod::Cpandoc and ultimately Pod::Perldoc.

FUNCTIONS

 find_matches

    Takes a word and returns the matches for that word. It's in a separate
    function to separate logic from presentation so other programs can use
    this module as well.
