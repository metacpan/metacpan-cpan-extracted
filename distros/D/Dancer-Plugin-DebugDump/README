NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::DebugDump - dump objects to debug log with Data::Dump
    [DEPRECATED]

DEPRECATION NOTICE
    *NOTE* : this module is now deprecated; there's no need for it, as
    Dancer's own debug keyword automatically serialises any references
    passed to it using Data::Dumper, so you can just say e.g.:

        debug \%foo;

    or

        debug "User details", \%foo;

    This plugin may be removed from CPAN at some point in the future; I've
    decided to leave it around with a deprecation notice for the time being
    so that it's still available for anyone already using it.

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a `debug_dump' keyword, which takes an optional label and an
    object or reference to dump, and calls Dancer's `debug' keyword after
    dumping the object / reference with Data::Dump.

    Allows quick and easy debugging by dumping stuff to your log/console.

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer::Plugin::DebugDump;

        debug_dump("My nice object" => $object);
        debug_dump("My hash" => \%hash);
        debug_dump($anotherref);
