Mail::ListDetector
------------------

This module can be installed as standard for a CPAN module:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make 
  make test
  make install

It provides the ability to examine Mail::Internet objects to determine
if they were posted to a mailing list, and if so, which mailing list. See
examples/sample.pl for how to use the module.

The documentation is as yet very poor, and this module should be
considered to still have alpha status - I may change functionality or
the API at any time, and it may not actually DO anything for you. Or it
might delete all your files.
