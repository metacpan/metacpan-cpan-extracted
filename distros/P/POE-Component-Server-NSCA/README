DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::Server::NSCA is a POE component that implements NSCA
    daemon functionality. This is the daemon program that accepts service
    check information from remote machines using send_nsca client or
    POE::Component::Client::NSCA.

    The component implements the network handling of accepting service
    check information from multiple clients, but doesn't deal with
    submitting the service checks to Nagios. Instead you will be provided
    with the service check results as events and decide how to deal with
    the results as you see fit.

    It is based in part on code shamelessly borrowed from Net::Nsca and
    optionally supports encryption using the Mcrypt module.

CONSTRUCTOR

    spawn

      Takes a number of parameters, mandatory ones are indicated:

        'password', password that should be used to encrypt the packet, mandatory;
        'encryption', the encryption method to use, see below, mandatory;
        'alias', set an alias on the component;
        'address', bind the listening socket to a particular address, default is IN_ADDR_ANY;
        'port', specify a port to listen on, default is 5667;
        'time_out', specify a time out in seconds for socket connections, default is 60;
        'access', an arrayref of Net::Netmask objects that will be granted access, default is 'any';

      Returns a POE::Component::Server::NSCA object.

      The 'encryption' method is an integer value indicating the type of
      encryption to employ:

             0 = None        (Do NOT use this option)
             1 = Simple XOR  (No security, just obfuscation, but very fast)
      
             2 = DES
             3 = 3DES (Triple DES)
             4 = CAST-128
             5 = CAST-256
             6 = xTEA
             7 = 3WAY
             8 = BLOWFISH
             9 = TWOFISH
             10 = LOKI97
             11 = RC2
             12 = ARCFOUR
      
             14 = RIJNDAEL-128
             15 = RIJNDAEL-192
             16 = RIJNDAEL-256
      
             19 = WAKE
             20 = SERPENT
      
             22 = ENIGMA (Unix crypt)
             23 = GOST
             24 = SAFER64
             25 = SAFER128
             26 = SAFER+

      Methods 2-26 require that the Mcrypt module is installed.

METHODS

    session_id

      Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    shutdown

      Terminates the component. Shuts down the listener and disconnects
      connected clients and unregisters registered sessions.

    getsockname

      Access to the POE::Wheel::SocketFactory method of the underlying
      listening socket.

INPUT EVENTS

    These are events from other POE sessions that our component will
    handle:

    register

      This will register the sending session. Takes a number of parameters:

         'event', the name of the event in the registering session that will be triggered, mandatory;
         'context', a scalar containing any reference data that your session demands;

      The component will increment the refcount of the calling session to
      make sure it hangs around for events. Therefore, you should use
      either unregister or shutdown to terminate registered sessions.

    unregister

      This will unregister the sending session.

OUTPUT EVENTS

    Registered sessions will receive events with the following parameters:

    ARG0

      ARG0 will contain a hashref with the following key/values:

       'version', the version of NSCA protocol in use. Will be 3;
       'host_name', the hostname for which the check is applicable;
       'svc_description', the service description, not applicable for host checks;
       'return_code', the result code of the check;
       'plugin_output', any output from the check plugin;
       'peeraddr', the IP address of the client that gave us the check information;
       'peerport', the IP address of the client that gave us the check information;
       'crc32', the checksum provided by the client;
       'checksum', the checksum as the poco calculated it;
       'timestamp', the clients timestamp;

    ARG1

      ARG1 will contain the value of the 'context' that was specified ( if
      applicable ) when the session registered.

PROVENANCE

    Based on Net::Nsca by P Kent

    Which was originally derived from work by Ethan Galstad.
