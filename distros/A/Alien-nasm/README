NAME

    Alien::nasm - Find or build nasm, the netwide assembler

VERSION

    version 0.18

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::nasm ();
     use Env qw( @PATH );
     
     unshift @ENV, Alien::nasm->bin_dir;
     system 'nasm', ...;

    Or with Alien::Build::ModuleBuild:

     use Alien::Base::ModuleBuild;
     Alien::Base::ModuleBuild->new(
       ...
       alien_bin_requires => {
         'Alien::nasm' => '0.11',
       },
       alien_build_commands => {
         "%{nasm} ...",
       },
       ...
     )->create_build_script;

DESCRIPTION

    This Alien module provides Netwide Assembler (NASM).

    This class is a subclass of Alien::Base, so all of the methods
    documented there should work with this class.

HELPERS

 nasm

     %{nasm}

    Returns the name of the nasm executable. As of this writing it is
    always nasm, but in the future it may have a different value.

CAVEATS

    This version of Alien::nasm adds nasm to your path, if it isn't already
    there when you use it, like this:

     use Alien::nasm;  # deprecated, issues a warning

    This was a design mistake, and now deprecated. When Alien::nasm was
    originally written, it was one of the first Alien tool style modules on
    CPAN. As such, the author and the Alien::Base team hadn't yet come up
    with the best practices for this sort of module. The author, and the
    Alien::Base team feel that for consistency and for readability it is
    better use Alien::nasm without the automatic import:

     use Alien::nasm ();

    and explicitly modify the PATH yourself (examples are above in the
    synopsis). The old style will issue a warning. The old behavior will be
    removed, but not before 31 January 2018.
