=head1 NAME

Lucy::Search::RequiredOptionalQuery - Join results for two Queries, one required, one optional.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $foo_and_maybe_bar = Lucy::Search::RequiredOptionalQuery->new(
        required_query => $foo_query,
        optional_query => $bar_query,
    );
    my $hits = $searcher->hits( query => $foo_and_maybe_bar );
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RequiredOptionalQuery joins the result sets of one Query which MUST match,
and one Query which SHOULD match.  When only the required Query matches,
its score is passed along; when both match, the scores are summed.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $reqopt_query = Lucy::Search::RequiredOptionalQuery->new(
        required_query => $foo_query,    # required
        optional_query => $bar_query,    # required
    );

Create a new RequiredOptionalQuery.

=over

=item *

B<required_query> - Query must must match.

=item *

B<optional_query> - Query which should match.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_required_query

    my $query = $required_optional_query->get_required_query();

Getter for the required Query.

=head2 set_required_query

    $required_optional_query->set_required_query($required_query);

Setter for the required Query.

=head2 get_optional_query

    my $query = $required_optional_query->get_optional_query();

Getter for the optional Query.

=head2 set_optional_query

    $required_optional_query->set_optional_query($optional_query);

Setter for the optional Query.

=head2 make_compiler

    my $compiler = $required_optional_query->make_compiler(
        searcher    => $searcher,     # required
        boost       => $boost,        # required
        subordinate => $subordinate,  # default: false
    );

Abstract factory method returning a Compiler derived from this Query.

=over

=item *

B<searcher> - A Searcher.

=item *

B<boost> - A scoring multiplier.

=item *

B<subordinate> - Indicates whether the Query is a subquery (as
opposed to a top-level query).  If false, the implementation must
invoke L<normalize()|Lucy::Search::Compiler/normalize> on the newly minted Compiler object before returning
it.

=head1 INHERITANCE

Lucy::Search::RequiredOptionalQuery isa L<Lucy::Search::PolyQuery> isa L<Lucy::Search::Query> isa Clownfish::Obj.
