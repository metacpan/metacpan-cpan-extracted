NAME

    AnyEvent::Ident - Simple asynchronous ident client and server

VERSION

    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS

    client:

     use AnyEvent::Ident qw( ident_client );
     
     ident_client '127.0.0.1', 113, $server_port, $client_port, sub {
       my($res) = @_; # isa AnyEvent::Client::Response 
       if($res->is_success)
       {
         print "user: ", $res->username, "\n"
         print "os:   ", $res->os, "\n"
       }
       else
       {
         warn "Ident error: " $res->error_type;
       }
     };

    server:

     use AnyEvent::Ident qw( ident_server );
     
     ident_server '127.0.0.1', 113, sub {
       my $tx = shift;
       if($tx->req->server_port == 400
       && $tx->req->client_port == 500)
       {
         $tx->reply_with_user('UNIX', 'grimlock');
       }
       else
       {
         $tx->reply_with_error('NO-USER');
       }
     };

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a simple procedural interface to
    AnyEvent::Ident::Client and AnyEvent::Ident::Server.

FUNCTIONS

 ident_server

     my $server = ident_server $hostname, $port, $callback;
     my $server = ident_server $hostname, $port, $callback, \%opt;

    Start an ident server listening to the address given by $hostname on
    port $port. For each request $callback will be called and passed in an
    instance of AnyEvent::Ident::Transaction.

    %opt is optional hash of arguments. See
    AnyEvent::Ident::Server#CONSTRUCTOR for legal key/value pairs and
    defaults.

 ident_client

     my $client = ident_client $hostname, $port, $server_port, $client_port, $callback;

    Make an ident request with the ident server at $hostname on port $port
    with the given port pair $server_port,$client_port. When the response
    comes back call $callback, with an instance of
    AnyEvent::Ident::Response.

CAVEATS

    ident is an oldish protocol and almost nobody uses it anymore. The RFC
    for the protocol clearly states that ident should not be used for
    authentication, at most it should be used only for audit (for example
    annotation of log files). In Windows and possibly other operating
    systems, an unprivileged user can listen to port 113 and on any
    untrusted network, a remote ident server is not a secure authentication
    mechanism.

    No modern operating systems enable the ident service by default, so you
    can't expect it to be there unless you have control of the server and
    have specifically enabled it.

    Most of the time a client wanting to use the ident protocol expects to
    find ident listening to port 113, which on many platforms (such as
    UNIX) requires special privileges (such as root).

    Under Linux you can use iptables to forward requests from port 113 to
    an unprivileged port. I was able to use this incantation to forward
    port 113 to port 8113:

     # iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 113 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8113
     # iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 --dport 113 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8113

    The first rule is sufficient for external clients, the second rule was
    required for clients connecting via the loopback interface (localhost).
