NAME
    PortageXS - Portage abstraction layer for perl

VERSION
    version 0.3.1

NAMING
    For CPAN users, the name of this module is likely confusing, and
    annoying.

    *   No prefix

        Ideally, I'd have a proper prefix like "Gentoo::", however, this is
        a dependency problem, and this package has lived for a while in the
        "Gentoo" ecosystem as this name, and changing a name will have
        limitations on adopting downstreams.

    *   No XS

        Though the name says "XS" in it, you'll see there is no "XS"
        anywhere in the tree. This, I imagine, is a result of naming
        crossover, and "XS" here means more "Access" or something.

    As such, my preferred name would be "Gentoo::Portage::API", or something
    like that, but we're stuck for now.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
  0.3.0 Series
   0.3.0
   Slurping Overhaul
    This module contains a lot of file slurping magic, in a few various
    forms, as well as path mangling and similar things.

    This release is a huge overhaul of how that works, and sufficiently more
    dependence is now placed on "Path::Tiny"'s head.

    "getFileContents" is now deprecated, and will warn when called.

    However, the nature of this change is likely introduce a few bugs in
    places I may not have transformed the code properly, which may not be
    immediately obvservable.

CHOPPING BLOCK
    I've inherited this module from Gentoo Staff, who are now more-or-less
    retired, and this code has been bitrotting away for a year.

    Its ugly, its crufty, and it has a lot of bad and evil things that need
    to die.

    And much of it is on my mental chopping block.

  Exporter based .... roles.
    Yes. You read correctly. This code uses Exporter to implement
    mixin-style class-composition, like roles. Just it uses Exporter to do
    it instead of a more sane "Role" based tool.

    This has the nasty side effect that everywhere you "use PortageXS", you
    inadvertently inject a whole load of functions you don't want, and will
    never want, and couldn't use if you did want them, because they all
    require an invocant in $_[0]

    Will be changed evenutally.

  Poor encapsulation and many classes directly modifying hash keys.
    All over the codebase there are weird tricks to make sure specific hash
    keys are present, and populate them lazily, and some tricks are
    implemented the same way a dozen times.

    All direct hash manipulation is scheduled to be ripped out
    unceremoniously in a future release, in favour of more sane tools like
    "Moo" based accessors, lazy loading and things like that.

  Poor concern seperation
    Every module that has in it its own routine for loading files into
    strings, is reinventing a bad wheel.

    This module is no exception.

    I plan to remove 90% of the filesystem interaction in favour of using
    "Path::Tiny" everywhere

    Its 1 more dep, and a whole load of better, and much more throughrougly
    tested code.

    So if you use "PortageXS" already, and you're using things of the above
    types, stop now.

        PortageXS::Core::getFileContents <-- will be a deprecated function in a future release.
